0/0:This is your last chance!
0/1:You're about to push me too far!
0/2:Once more, and you're really going to regret it.
1/0:We are saving these children from further disintegration and impurity.
2/0:This is your last chance!
2/1:You're about to push me too far!
2/2:Once more, and you're really going to regret it.
3/0:You just need to cool it.  Sheesh!
3/1:Are you quite finished with that nonsense?!
3/2:I hope you're done showing off.
4/0:Never had a Pequochino in my life.  I heard it's gourmet and bio-enhanced.
5/0:You just need to cool it.  Sheesh!
5/1:Are you quite finished with that nonsense?!
5/2:I hope you're done showing off.
6/0:A BONUS?  You expect me to walk into a chemical spill for a few extra credits?
7/0:I'm going for reinforcements.
7/1:I'm on my way to get backup.
8/0:I'm going for reinforcements.
8/1:I'm on my way to get backup.
9/0:I'm outta here.
9/1:Aaaaaaiiieee!
9/2:No!
9/3:Damn my aim...
9/4:Gotta get myself out of this...
10/0:I'm outta here.
10/1:Aaaaaaiiieee!
11/0:...yet more deviation from the Plan.  Paul was to arrive with the key, bringing the perfected genetic code.  JC was to awaken to greet the new age.  Instead, that woman came, followed soon after by the Hateful Ones.  Where is Paul?  What is going on?
12/0:Oh well.  Thought I heard something.
13/0:Coulda fell by itself, I guess.
14/0:Her Holiness and Chairman Dumier are making a business deal.  It may bring money, it may bring power, but it won't bring balance into the lives of ordinary people.
15/0:Distracted by vermin again...
16/0:Better than none of the above from Cindy.  (sardonic laugh)  Meet me outside the tavern.
17/0:Guess I ran the feeb off.
17/1:Huh.  Got away.
18/0:You can't get me a ride?
19/0:Looked like an enclave type.
20/0:Offbrand must be lost... heh-heh.
21/0:I spend many hours a day hear, listening to the wise words of Her Holiness.
22/0:Brother knows what's good for him.
23/0:Chick knows what's good for her.
24/0:Gotta calm down.  No use feebin' out over someone who's already gone.
24/1:Coulda been worse, I guess.
25/0:The punk got away.
26/0:Where you goin'?
26/1:I'm guessing that's bad.
26/2:Uh-oh.
26/3:That looks like a wake-up call.
26/4:Okay, okay, I can handle whatever it is.
27/0:Oh no.  Wonder what's going on.
27/1:Great.  I should probably start running too.
27/2:That can't be good.
27/3:Uh-oh -- SSC on the run.
27/4:Looks like trouble's about to find me.
28/0:
29/0:Perhaps this is my destiny, to join the Illuminati in their endeavors.
30/0:Why don't you tell him yourself?
31/0:Oh... I was hired to clean the system out.  The spiderbots haven't really been getting the job done.
32/0:Perhaps you want a black-market biomod canister, which enables non-Piezochem functionality.  I'm also selling three gas grenades, which deliver a biotoxin irritant in gaseous form.  I've also got an ammo clip, which provides universal ammunition for all weapons.  You must pay market price for each.
33/0:I've got a black-market biomod canister, enables non-Piezochem functionality.  If you choose this item, we will direct you to a drop site for it after you have paid. Or you could take three scrambler grenades, which produce viral electronic transmission that affects bots, and temporarily switches their alliances.  And I've also got five multitools, used to bypass security devices, like keypads, cameras, and turrets, and to pick electronic locks.  All are available for market price.
34/0:
35/0:Good.  Helios will -- Wait!  Must be an overload... or a self-destruct sequence.  A blast door just sealed off the only exit.  You'll be trapped unless you can kill the power with the control box on the south wall -- or destroy the exposed conduits.  I should've known old Alex Jacobson would have a surprise waiting for unauthorised users...
36/0:Thanks again.  Good luck.
37/0:Ka-BOOM!  How do you like that?
38/0:Ka-BOOM!  How do you like that?
39/0:Look out!
40/0:Leave me alone!
41/0:Look out!
42/0:Good thing I've got my eyes open, or else I would've walked right into that one.
43/0:
43/1:
43/2:
43/3:
43/4:
43/5:
43/6:
43/7:
44/0:Good thing I've got my eyes open, or else I would've walked right into that one.
45/0:I was engaging the enemy when he fled.  Did you see anyone?
46/0:I was engaging the enemy when he fled.  Did you see anyone?
47/0:Seen anyone suspicious?  
47/1:I'm after someone -- did you see anyone come this way?
48/0:Seen anyone suspicious?  
48/1:I'm after someone -- did you see anyone come this way?
49/0:Good.  Now meet your pilot outside and return to Trier.  We're going to find out if this teleportation device really works.
50/0:Glad it wasn't me...
50/1:Scab's gonna pay for that.
51/0:An interesting discovery.  So Dr. Nassif has a cousin at the Tarsus Academy in New Cairo.  The visitation pass will let you enter the school on Level 107 of the arcology.  Find the cousin, Eeva, and see if she leads you to ApostleCorp.  First you will need a pass to the arcology itself, though.  Maybe you can get one from someone in the medina.
52/0:We're lucky we tapped into city power a few years ago, or else this place would be unlivable.
53/0:Scab's dead.  Soon as I get the chance.
53/1:Killer's gone.  Man.
54/0:Pretty low, stealin' from us.  Huh.  // gives up
54/1:Thief's gone.  Nothin' I can do about it.
55/0:Huh.  Weird.  Better take a peek.
55/1:I know you're here.
55/2:This ain't someplace you wanna get caught.
56/0:Somethin's gettin' scrip'ed.  Don't ask me what.
57/0:Your game, scab.
57/1:Better be packin' or better already have run.
57/2:Any second now...
57/3:I've got an instinct for this sort of thing...
57/4:This is messed up.
58/0:We've gotta be right on top of this scab.
58/1:Yo, be ready to jacket this feeb...
59/0:Be careful, man.
60/0:Watch my back, girl.
61/0:She always was a prankster.
62/0:I saw that.
63/0:You will first gain entry to the main complex.  Mako Ballistics is a very inward-looking, distrustful enterprise, so expect automated surveillance and armed guards.
64/0:I think something illegal is happening.  People hide their faces as they walk by me.  They avoid my questions.
65/0:You know I can't.
66/0:The organization does have some image problems, I suppose.
67/0:You have no idea what the consequences would be if you were captured.
68/0:I am sorry, but I am really busy right now.
69/0:You can force your way in by breaking a window, but see the red border?  The glass is alarmed and could attract attention.  If you have a multitool, you could quietly hack the door's keypad instead.
70/0:That should fit most firearms.  Good luck.  Be careful of our turrets and alarms -- the terrorists have reprogrammed them.
71/0:Vmail sender replied:
72/0:What seems like victory might be simply the first stage of your defeat.
73/0:I get the idea.
74/0:
75/0:There's this guy I'm looking for -- have you seen him?
76/0:Gobs everywhere, but I'm wise to their ways...
76/1:Hmmmm.
76/2:SOMETHIN' ain't right.
77/0:There's this guy I'm looking for -- have you seen him?
78/0:Not cool...
78/1:Yo, if that's a person, I think you're behind enemy lines.
78/2:Somethin' ain't right.
79/0:There's this woman I'm looking for -- have you seen her?
80/0:I know when a situation's about to get scrip'ed.
81/0:There's this woman I'm looking for -- have you seen her?
82/0:... saw SOMETHIN'...
83/0:Maybe I'm just jumpy after that copter refused to follow protocol or land.
84/0:
85/0:Have you noticed anything unusual?
85/1:I don't like this.  What do you think?
85/2:Hmmm...  What do you think is going on?
86/0:... some scab scratchin' for food...
87/0:Here.
88/0:Have you noticed anything unusual?
88/1:I don't like this.  What do you think?
88/2:Hmmm...  What do you think is going on?
89/0:Hey!  Is someone messin' with me?
89/1:Somethin's bein' scrip'ed, or I'm gettin' jumpy...
90/0:I've got you covered.
91/0:I hope I can sell a design before next month's dues come around.
92/0:Doesn't that sound awfully suspicious?
92/1:Does that noise seem odd to you?
93/0:Doesn't that sound awfully suspicious?
93/1:Does that noise seem odd to you?
94/0:Huh?  Did you see that?
94/1:Doesn't that look suspicious?
95/0:As the Templars unveil their plans and their alarming influence and strength, the world waits to see what this work may entail.
96/0:Huh?  Did you see that?
96/1:Doesn't that look suspicious?
97/0:Then I think you have some explaining to do.
98/0:
99/0:Better check out that noise.
100/0:I heard something -- takin' a closer look.
101/0:Hey!
101/1:Looks like I got a situation.
102/0:Hey, you!
102/1:Boo!
102/2:Wh-Who's that?  // worried
103/0:Show your face, feeb!
103/1:You're just makin' it worse on yourself...
103/2:Gonna fight me or WHAT?
103/3:Fine.  I'll play your little game...
104/0:Let's go.  Come on!
105/0:What a day.  Maybe I should go home before it gets worse.  
106/0:See him?!  Right there!
107/0:See her?!  Right there!
108/0:Wha--!
108/1:(gasp)
109/0:Now you're in it, scab -- a fight!
109/1:I can stand up to this...
109/2:Come on!  Give me all you got!
110/0:That makes you a private, too.
111/0:You'll be doing everybody a favor by taking that thing out.
112/0:Your problem's solved.
113/0:I haven't yet done anything to earn his confidence.
114/0:Do me a favor.  Try to understand what this confilct is about before you murder anybody else.
115/0:Resourceful little muckraker, aren't you?  How much do you want?
116/0:Guess I'm wrong.
116/1:Eh, whatever.
117/0:It ain't nothin'.
118/0:Seein' stuff.  My brain's been twitchin' like a feeb.
119/0:Hearin' stuff again.  My girlfriend's right -- I oughtta kick the zyme.
119/1:Just random noise.
120/0:Did you see how this happened? 
120/1:Do you know what happened here? 
120/2:Do you know what's going on here? 
120/3:Do you know what this is all about? 
121/0:Scab better not try that on me...
122/0:Did you see how this happened? 
122/1:Do you know what happened here? 
122/2:Do you know what's going on here? 
122/3:Do you know what this is all about? 
123/0:Probably just some scabland feeb havin' a fit.
124/0:Just me and the gob bait...
125/0:Scab managed to fade, but I notice things.  I'll know next time a situation's gettin' scrip'ed.
125/1:Scab got away from me.  This time.
126/0:A secret entrance -- to the cathedral?
127/0:Did you see who opened this door?
128/0:Looked like an enclave type.
129/0:
130/0:Did you see who opened this door?
131/0:Offbrand must be lost... heh-heh.
132/0:
133/0:Did you see who turned these lights on?
134/0:Attention trainees -- self-study will last only until the top of the hour.
135/0:I hate to say it, but I think she's leaning towards a QueeQueg's endorsement.
136/0:Did you see who turned these lights on?
137/0:Did you see who shut off these lights?
138/0:You have more training than THAT.
139/0:I've seen the evidence myself.  He's working for those Purity crusaders -- the Templars.  But you have nothing to worry about now.  I took care of the situation.
140/0:Did you see who shut off these lights?
141/0:We can handle them, no problem.
142/0:You want me to steal a carcass -- from a nightclub?
143/0:... a gun... in his skull... (giggle)...
144/0:Protection from what?
145/0:Business is always about the same... since you asked.  That's what I was saying.  You can barely make a profit up here because of the high rent.
146/0:Poor girl...
147/0:There are certain lines you shouldn't cross.  I hear the Omar recruit members by kidnapping HOMELESS people.  Turn down the wrong alley, and whack!  You're a robot.
148/0:You deaf?
149/0:Our facility in Trier provides more than half the population of the city with jobs they can be proud of -- the production of bots, from security grade to military level.  Helping to keep the world safe.
150/0:I thought we understood each other, Alex.  Oh well.  I guess it won't come as any surprise that I'm going to have to kill you before you can reach the Statue.  What you want to do threatens my life's work.  See you shortly.
151/0:You're marked, man.  Hey!  Hear that?  // threatening
152/0:You're marked, girl.  Hey!  Hear that?  // threatening
153/0:Forget it.  Scab's gone.
154/0:Musta thought twice when he saw US.
155/0:Musta thought twice when she saw US.
156/0:That's right, you arrived and you're still there.  I saw you myself -- the real NG Resonance -- and now you're dead.  In real life, you're a spoiled brat the world can do without.
157/0:We'll always lead the people, though they'll never know our names.
158/0:I don't forget.  Not something like that.
158/1:Least I came through it okay.
159/0:It's a hard time for the Church, but this is when Her Holiness would have needed your support.  She died during the rescue attempt, which means that there might be a crisis in faith unless you, as the High Augur, can reassure the believers.
160/0:Figures.  Guess takeback's gonna have to wait.
161/0:Least I'm not the one who ended up dead.
161/1:This ain't goin' unanswered.  Hear me?!  You're gonna pay!
162/0:Whatever they say, this ain't cruelty.  This right here, starvin' these gobs and makin' 'em go at it, this is justice.
163/0:The air's not so bad inside the mosque.  You'll start to feel better.  Just get some rest and forget about Tarsus.  It's a very selective program.
164/0:That's one dead scab next time we cross paths...
165/0:Onward to Final Purity.
166/0:Scab's gone.  Huh.  They better believe me when I tell 'em it was stolen.
166/1:Guess it's long gone by now.
167/0:Hold on.  I'm too loaded down right now.
168/0:Five times?  That's quite an increase.
169/0:I see.  Sorry to hear that.
170/0:Yeah, he's laying low like Dr. Nassif requested.  Billie seems to be mixed up with the Order Church.
171/0:I haven't got the credits for the biomods. [1700]
172/0:This battle will be the first step in your purification.
173/0:We're trapped!  I can't believe SSC Command let us get into this mess.
174/0:That riot was started by the workers NOT the Order --
175/0:I would've preferred something more direct.
176/0:I appreciate your dedication to reaching the Order church in Lower Seattle, but walking through that cloud to activate the Inclinator now that it's powered up could contaminate your body for years to come.  You may want to reconsider your actions.
177/0:The profit motive served society well, but our technology has advanced far enough.  It's time to make intelligent use of what we've already created.
178/0:You're free to proceed.  We're just warning people to steer clear of that bot.
179/0:Of course.  Alex.  Sorry, they say the brain-freeze snaps off a few dendrites.  So, it's time.  Your biomod architecture -- it's universal?  That's what reversed my coma?
180/0:The Church suffers from certain internal disputes.  I can explain more later.  Hurry, Alex.  You'll find us in the old Hartford Turbine factory in Lower Seattle.
181/0:I got myself in here, didn't I?
182/0:I activated a pilot beacon on the flight deck.
183/0:
184/0:She's a liar and a fake.  And so are you.
185/0:Maskini Nassif asked me to look for his daughter, Eeva.  He's very worried.  Is that you?
186/0:How 'bout you distract the terrorist while I sneak by?
187/0:Hey!  Somebody lost?
187/1:Thought you were gonna catch me by surprise, eh?
187/2:Real smooth.
188/0:I'm just guessin', but spread out and I bet we scare a scab out of its hole.
189/0:Where you hidin', feeb?
189/1:Scab's shakin'.  Askin': 
189/2:Just a matter of time...
189/3:Better hold your breath.  I got good ears...
189/4:I better not get jumped by another greasel.
189/5:SOMETHIN' isn't right...
190/0:I can't let you do that.  I'll kill you if I have to.
191/0:I'm hurt.  Scab doesn't wanna make friends.
191/1:Keep lookin'.
192/0:Can't see what it is from here...  SOMETHIN', though.
193/0:Thought I saw someone.  Be right back.
194/0:I've seen the NG commercial, the endorsement of Pequod's.  Thanks a million.
195/0:I heard that.  // threat
196/0:Hey!
196/1:Time for business.
197/0:Thirty-five wins, twenty-two titles... I guess that's not a bad legacy for a fighter like 'Zilla.  Sure thought she had more years left in her, though.
198/0:Someday, they will awaken.
199/0:Scrip' time in the badlands...
199/1:Tryin' to run a drag on me, huh?
199/2:Hey, yo!  You just got yourself killed.
200/0:Never fear.  Miss Denton has nothing more to accomplish here.  The data is safe, and our forces should be on the move.  Be proud, paladins, we're about to make history!
201/0:Well, how-dee-do, sir.
202/0:Yes.  Beneath the ruins of the Black Gate, JC constructed a portal to his secret base in Antarctica.  Only descendents of the Denton cell-line can go through.  However, the facility is already in the hands of the Templars.
203/0:
204/0:Maybe they are here to complete their orders for the school, any way that they can.
205/0:Thanks for your skill and discretion.  Here's that biomod canister I mentioned.
206/0:Just get ready to press the button.
207/0:It's so good to see you again, darling.  Any news about that apartment?
208/0:Just tell me who.  I was the best divebomber in the RAF, flatlined a trench in one run in the Ukraine, flew a bird with no --
209/0:Get lost before we change our minds.
210/0:Here's some money for the door code.  [250 credits.]
211/0:Well, how-dee-do, ma'am.
212/0:Get back here!
212/1:You're makin' me mad...
212/2:Afraid, huh?
212/3:Gonna scrip' this or WHAT?  Jeez!
213/0:These issues must be brought before Her Holiness.
214/0:I'll take your word for it.
215/0:Hell, I'll second that.
216/0:Get this feeb!
217/0:I saw your face.  You're marked, scab!
218/0:Bingo!
219/0:
220/0:Whoa!
220/1:Aaaa!
221/0:Meanwhile, people go hungry.
222/0:Not everyone is ready to begin their Search.
223/0:(growl)
223/1:Want a piece of me?  Come on!
223/2:And... ACTION!
224/0:Better kiss your scab ass goodbye.
224/1:Bad move, feeb.
224/2:That's right, scab.  This is for real.
225/0:
226/0:Don't nobody mess with ME, man.
227/0:....  Shut up.
228/0:Small-time crooks don't need jet fighters.  Hand it over or else.
229/0:Ooo, tough girl.
230/0:
230/1:
230/2:
231/0:We were not all engineered the same.  Different strains had different purposes -- some are more verbally adept, others made for battle, and others made as leaders.  JC's arrival only amplified these differences.  His presence has changed us all.
232/0:I think we're through here.
233/0:No one better try anything on my watch.
234/0:An orphan.  You were pretty pampered for an orphan.  Why not be a banker or something?
235/0:I'll take both. [800]
236/0:This is the apartment of Dr. Nassif's uncle.  Look around for clues.  Perhaps Dr. Nassif contacted him when she arrived in Cairo.
237/0:The Order wanted to stop the experiment.  That's about all I know.
238/0:My bird!
239/0:How so?
240/0:
241/0:... diseased freak.
242/0:Hang back -- this is my show.
242/1:Scab action...
243/0:You may pass.
244/0:Get him!
245/0:Get her!
246/0:Watch me juice this gob...
247/0:Upon consideration, you'll see that this arrangement is for the best.  "General ideas are no proof of the strength, but rather of the insufficiency of the human intellect."  The words of Alexis de Tocqueville, an observer of the birth of modern democracy.  Though general ideas allow human minds to make judgments quickly, they are necessarily incomplete.
248/0:A stinkin' greasel...
249/0:Come to papa, baby gob.
250/0:The pilot will be interrogated.  I shouldn't tell you more than that.
251/0:A freakin' karkian!
252/0:Easy, boy.
253/0:Responding to the rioting in Trier, WTO Director Chad Dumier made a gesture of reconciliation today.
254/0:... gettin' sick of you hangin' around...
254/1:Ain't had enough yet?
255/0:How about that.  Well, it would be best for me not to know your business with Mr. O'Rourke, but let me give you the bounty I had put on his head.  I am also prepared to extend to you a membership to the VIP club.
256/0:Human consciousness is not ready for what JC and Paul intend.
257/0:Don't be naive.  Go to the Order headquarters in the old Hartford Turbine warehouse in Lower Seattle.  It will all become clear to you.
258/0:I can't leave these bots unattended, or they might fall into the hands of one of our enemies.
259/0:Let's rip.
260/0:I just hope Jamila and Jennifer are safe.
261/0:This dust, it feeds on carbon from human bodies.  We're breathing the ashes of everyone who has died here.
262/0:Where you goin'?
262/1:What's up?
262/2:Uh-oh -- that looks bad.
262/3:If I didn't need the bonus, I'd be following you.
262/4:Just keep telling myself -- "hazard pay."
262/5:Oh crap.
263/0:Where you goin'?
263/1:What's up?
263/2:Uh-oh -- that looks bad.
263/3:If I didn't need the bonus, I'd be following you.
263/4:Just keep telling myself -- "hazard pay."
263/5:Oh crap.
264/0:No problem.  I'm gonna have to get used to the idea sooner or later.
265/0:Send Mr. Kirkpatrick our regards.
266/0:When I said twenty-four hours, I meant twenty-four hours minus my sleep time.  I'm about ready to hit the sack.
267/0:Done peein' your pants?
267/1:Thought you was shook.
267/2:So.  Think you can stand up to this, huh?
267/3:Boo!
268/0:SSC records show that several students have been reported missing.  You might want to ask some of the children if they know what's going on.
269/0:Must be the same one.
270/0:Hey, don't give up.  Someone will come up with a cure.  Maybe one of the Nassifs.  They have some real brains in that family.
271/0:Now that I've activated what's left of ApostleCorp, what sort of future are you trying to bring about?  I've heard JC's version.
272/0:All me!  Watch and learn...   // talking to buddy
273/0:Run him off this time!
274/0:Yo, she's back!
275/0:Keep your hands to yourself.
275/1:Stay away from me.
275/2:I won't stand for this disrespect.
275/3:Ouch -- that hurt.
275/4:Don't push me!
275/5:Your clumsiness is beginning to disturb me...
276/0:Stupid way to get yourself juiced.
276/1:Wanna borrow a knife or somethin'?  Give youself a chance?  That was a joke.  Laugh, scab!
277/0:Keep your hands to yourself.
277/1:Stay away from me.
277/2:I won't stand for this disrespect.
277/3:I really must ask you to watch where you're going.
277/4:To think you'd treat a lady like this!
277/5:You could at least apologize for practically running me over!
278/0:(laugh)  Yeah, and that the world's been colonized by aliens from another star system and we picked HIM out of everybody who ever lived to save the planet.
279/0:That's not funny.  That's dangerous.
279/1:I don't appreciate this needling.
279/2:Gah!  I will not be intimidated by this nonsense.
280/0:The last century was ruled by progress and novelty for their own sake.  This one has a chance to be ruled by purpose.
281/0:That's not funny.  That's dangerous.
281/1:I don't appreciate this needling.
281/2:Gah!  I will not be intimidated by this nonsense.
282/0:You're giving me the creeps.
282/1:Stop looking at me!
282/2:
282/3:I know I'm a handsome man -- but there's no need to stare.
282/4:Pardon me, are you aware that you're being rude?
282/5:Please stop staring at me.
283/0:
284/0:You're giving me the creeps.
284/1:Stop looking at me!
284/2:
284/3:Hmmph... how rude!
284/4:I'm choosing to ignore you.
284/5:In polite society, it's considered rude to stare.
285/0:I learn more by traveling than sitting on a landing pad.  Where do you want to go?
286/0:I hope you don't mind if I take credit for this.  It could put me in line for a VP position.
287/0:I'm really going to call security if you don't cut it out.
287/1:Go find someone else to bother...
287/2:Stop acting so weird.
287/3:Stop that!  
287/4:If you don't stop, I'm going to be forced to.... make a formal complaint.
288/0:I'm really going to call security if you don't cut it out.
288/1:Go find someone else to bother...
288/2:Stop acting so weird.
288/3:I'm going to have to report you to the authorities.
288/4:I don't think you ought to be doing that...
288/5:Your behavior is apalling!
289/0:Don't hurt me!
289/1:Not me!  No!
289/2:I didn't DO anything!
290/0:Don't hurt me!
290/1:Not me!  No!
290/2:I didn't DO anything!
291/0:What happened?
292/0:With someone like you aiding JC, we are hopeful. 
293/0:I wasn't sure about you at first, but you turned out to be a good man.
294/0:When do I find out what this program is all about?
295/0:Rewards can be granted only for information related to a crime.
296/0:They'll track us if we take a chopper, but I think I can get us out of the Upper Seattle enclave.  Where are you?
297/0:If you are Order, you are fundamentalist.  You want to blow up anything that has wires or moving parts.  If you are WTO, you want everybody working in a factory.  The rest of us are caught in the middle.
298/0:Well, better get your buns over to the Pit.  Your gob's droppin' into the fire.
299/0:Tell you what, I'll give you the sloshed-flyer special.  Any local hops you need during the next twenty-four hours, just fifty percent more than my usual rate.  You can't beat that.  [750 credits.]
300/0:The church won't turn me away, though -- will they?
301/0:And mine, too, apparently.
302/0:It was nice to meet you.
303/0:Point and pull, drop and drool.
303/1:Quick -- duck!
304/0:What would this "pure democracy" look like?
305/0:You seekers are just little parrots, cheep-cheep-cheep, repeating a new batch of words every week.
306/0:I got a real sweet shot.
307/0:Watch him jerk.
308/0:Watch her jerk.
309/0:We were out shopping and needed a break.  There weren't a lot of options.
310/0:Hey, don't give up.  Someone will come up with a cure.  Maybe one of the Nassifs.  They have some real brains in that family.
311/0:Move it.
311/1:You're not authorized to be here.
311/2:This area's off-limits.
312/0:Move it.
312/1:You're not authorized to be here.
312/2:This area's off-limits.
313/0:Bot, attack.  I said attack!
314/0:You're about to push me too far.
314/1:I'm almost at the end of my rope.
314/2:I really thought I'd made myself clear.
315/0:Better call in the bot....
316/0:Better get a med bot over here...
316/1:Med bot better hurry... lotta juice flowin'.
317/0:You're about to push me too far.
317/1:I'm almost at the end of my rope.
317/2:I really thought I'd made myself clear.
318/0:That repair bot better show up.
319/0:That's it!
319/1:I won't take any more of this!
320/0:That's it!
320/1:I won't take any more of this!
321/0:So you're ready to behave civilly now...
321/1:I hope we're done with your theatrics.
321/2:Good to see you've finally come to your senses.
322/0:(whine)  Quit.  I need to rest.
323/0:So you're ready to behave civilly now...
323/1:I hope we're done with your theatrics.
323/2:Good to see you've finally come to your senses.
324/0:I'm not alone!
325/0:We know how to take care of ourselves!
326/0:I think you'll like it here.  Just give the place a chance.
327/0:I can't believe he would recruit some modified freak, especially for a mission as critical as this one.
328/0:After I finish with Calculus, I need to spend some time on my Ethics homework.
329/0:Out of order.
330/0:One of the interns got gunned down one day.  He showed up a day before he was scheduled to start and wasn't in the database yet.
331/0:... citta... citta... citta...
332/0:Is that illegal?
333/0:You must know all the ins and outs of this building.
334/0:JC awakens.  Soon the world will be different.
335/0:This one already told the other one from JC everything.  Betrayal.  This one was to be set free, but it was more lies and destruction.  You must not betray.  JC may be in danger already.
336/0:Wrong way.  Flight Bay 24 -- we must strike soon.
337/0:Anything I want.  Anything.  The best mods are black-market.  Attack drones.  Bot domination.  This will add value when I go back to the corporate market.
338/0:I still don't have any money.
339/0:Have anything else for me?
340/0:What a day.
341/0:I'm going for help.
342/0:I'm going for help.
343/0:I can't take anymore!
343/1:(yell)
343/2:I've never been a fighter...
343/3:I don't fancy a duel right now...
343/4:Ah... yes... I think I'll leave now.
343/5:No!  Don't hurt me!
343/6:Physical combat... barbarian!
344/0:Damn it!  I'll stop you myself.
345/0:I can't take anymore!
345/1:(yell)
345/2:Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear....!
345/3:NooooooO!
345/4:Don't hurt me!!
345/5:This can't be happening...!
346/0:They think Plague 11 is just another punishment for us being lazy and poor.
347/0:... thought she was hot stuff.
348/0:Target down.
348/1:Relax.  I took care of it.
348/2:We did it.
348/3:Well, that broke up the routine.
349/0:Another wasted life.
350/0:Got the bastard.
351/0:I have work to do in Cairo.
352/0:Very good.  I will allow the jet to leave.  Why do you need a pilot?
353/0:The chick's down.
354/0:I have nightmares about those things getting one of my children.
355/0:But how long until I'm threatened again?
356/0:I'm heading up a strike team -- a military operation.  Mr. Dumier must have decided that I'm expendable.
357/0:That will teach them.  
358/0:
359/0:Very good.  No more for now.  Our agents will begin watching you.  When they approve your security clearance, one of them will make contact.  Goodbye -- and may Purity prevail.
360/0:Strange... this building stands on the site of the Porta Negra, or Black Gate, the ruins of the old city wall from Roman times.  About all we know is that the facility underground is not a museum.  You'll need to discover the security code to the elevator before you'll be able to investigate it for us.  Try the Nine Worlds Tavern in central Trier -- maybe one of the locals knows something about this place.
361/0:Maybe you're right.  Dumier and his blackguards have had a free hand for far too long.
362/0:That didn't look right.
363/0:If it was me, I'd let that pompous Brit twist in the wind.
364/0:That didn't look right.
365/0:That sounded odd...
366/0:Protesters claimed that the vote had been somehow fixed and that the results did not reflect the will of the people, particularly those living outside the enclave.
367/0:That sounded odd...
368/0:We don't want to be seen talking together any more than is necessary.
369/0:After another batch of excellent progress reports, I am pleased to announce that we are nearing the closing of this phase of our field operations, slightly ahead of schedule.  We will be in contact soon with your new orders.  
370/0:You owe it to yourself and your family to purchase the only real Plague-11 cure. 
371/0:Hm, What'd I just bump into...?
372/0:Hm, What'd I just bump into...?
373/0:(grunt) Hey -- you're assaulting an officer of the WTO!
374/0:(grunt) Hey -- you're assaulting an officer of the WTO!
375/0:Oh my god!
376/0:Oh my god!
377/0:.... like an obsessive-compulsive housewife on pequod's...
378/0:The Pit pays.  You'll find out.  Just stick with it.
379/0:My bird!
380/0:Very well.  In addition, you will be given one black-market biomod canister.
381/0:As much as you can trust anyone who takes bribes.  Now -- leave me be.  Let's make an effort not to be seen together.
382/0:People will come to be grateful for our heroism.
383/0:What!?
384/0:So the Order hired you to kill the chief scientist on the Mag Rail project.  A pretty way to do business.  The WTO prefers that you spare the scientist and instead upload the gun's schematics to our Seattle headquarters.  By law all innovations must be registered and patented through one of our offices.
385/0:It wasn't always called Club Vox.  It's been just about everything under the sun.
386/0:This is a private laboratory.  State your business.
387/0:You should take the biomod canister before it is purchased by another customer.
388/0:Well, look who's back.
389/0:I'm getting sick of doing all this damage control...  
390/0:Rumor has it the Order was involved in some kind of raid..
391/0:
392/0:I don't think you'll find your ApostleCorp official out sightseeing at the Black Gate ruins, which is where the sewer leads.  Regardless, it would be a shame to lose you to a pack of sewer greasels. 
393/0:The woman you called Her Holiness was the daughter of the Illuminatus Beth DuClare.  She founded the Church after the Collapse as a foothold to regaining power.
394/0:Someone tryin' to play games with me...?
395/0:Someone tryin' to play games with me...?
396/0:Some sort of smoke-screen...
397/0:Some sort of smoke-screen...
398/0:Tryin' to get me to look the wrong way, huh?
399/0:Tryin' to get me to look the wrong way, huh?
400/0:... something agitating the fauna.
400/1:Section 013... unsanitary pest.
401/0:... something agitating the fauna.
401/1:Section 013... unsanitary pest.
402/0:Someone must've killed it...
403/0:Someone must've killed it...
404/0:The going rate.  [500 credits.]
405/0:Guess I'll just wander around until they let me back into the building.
406/0:Victory will be ours...again.
407/0:Perfect.  The Regional Director will think that my shop had a hand in the decision.  Let  me give you a look at those weapon mods I mentioned.  I have an Ammo Scavenger, a Fragmentary Rounds Mod, and a Glass Destabilizer.  I got them off an Omar who was crucified at the end of the street.  Gruesome scene.  The work of Templars, I'm sure.
408/0:Hold on....
409/0:Mr. O'Rourke is expecting you.  Come right in.  I will unlock the door.
410/0:You're our secret weapon.
411/0:Thanks a million.  No tellin' what he was gonna do next.
412/0:Very well.  In addition, you will be given one black-market biomod canister.
413/0:The Pequod's manager in the arcology made exactly that mistake of being too political -- aligned himself with the WTO.  Now he is dead, from what I hear.
414/0:You deaf?  I said I wanna get me a fly leather outfit like the one you're wearin'.
415/0:Filthy birds.
416/0:Just hang around a little while -- I'm not sure where I want to go yet.
417/0:Filthy birds.
418/0:You were mistaken.
419/0:Here, kitty, kitty.
420/0:Here, kitty, kitty.
421/0:Damn rats. 
422/0:Damn rats. 
423/0:Burn in hell!
424/0:Thought that was closed.
425/0:Thought that was closed.
426/0:Hmmm... I guess Headmaster Archer can be pretty harsh.
427/0:You don't seem too overwhelmed.
428/0:I'm pretty certain that a few mechanized units can tip the balance.
429/0:I can't wait to get home.  I'm gonna go straight to the Greasel Pit and enjoy myself for a change.
430/0:
431/0:All this commotion is probably just some non-enclave types trying to make some extra credits by smuggling.  I don't know that I blame them.  It's rough in Lower Seattle.
432/0:What are you trying to do, trainee?
432/1:This is not the way to improve your performance review.
433/0:Was I not clear?  Leave the area immediately, trainee.
433/1:You are not permitted to be here, trainee.  Leave now.
434/0:Snap out of it.  Stop staring.
434/1:WHAT are you looking at?
435/0:Your way is clear.  You may go.
436/0:I'm not joking.  This is going on your permanent record.
436/1:Trainee, cease with this bizarre nonsense.
437/0:This is completely unacceptable behavior.  
437/1:There will be disciplinary action for this unwarranted aggression.
438/0:Thought that was open.
439/0:Have you lost it?
439/1:I don't know what you're trying to do, but you're about to cross the line.
440/0:Thought that was open.
441/0:I've had just about enough of your attitude, trainee.
441/1:Am I failing to make myself clear?  Get your act together.
442/0:Hm.  That wasn't on.
443/0:Okay -- that's it.  I'm reporting you.
443/1:I've had it.  This is going into your file.
444/0:Hm.  That wasn't on.
445/0:That's all you know about the leaders?
446/0:That's enough.
446/1:Knock it off. 
447/0:Hm.  That wasn't off.
448/0:Watch where you're going.
448/1:Hey!
449/0:Hm.  That wasn't off.
450/0:Get moving.  You have work to do for the Grand Master.
451/0:It's trashed.  Must be some kind of maniac.
451/1:Section 231... destruction of private property...
452/0:It's trashed.  Must be some kind of maniac.
452/1:Section 231... destruction of private property...
453/0:Someone's gonna pay to fix that.
454/0:Someone's gonna pay to fix that.
455/0:Too bad.  Stop back when your cashflow's better.
456/0:Upon the arrival of the key, JC was to be awakened, to welcome the perfected genetic code.  Then he and Paul were to share it with the world. Now, there is much unexpected violence -- even you threaten our survival -- but we will proceed according to the original Plan. 
457/0:We were hoping you would run into Dr. Nassif's uncle here, but it looks like he is one step ahead of us.  After you destroy the hydroponics, why don't you pay him a visit?  His apartment is on the second floor of a building across the square from the Order church.
458/0:Good work at the Emerald Suites.  What we need you to do now is check out the Mako facility north of town.  We know they've been doing illegal weapons research and that your former trainer, Dr. Nassif, has contacts there.  You'll need to hire a pilot and leave at once.
459/0:I guess the situation in the arcology hasn't hurt business.  Aren't you worried that the Templars might occupy the medina?
460/0:Instruction set decoded.   Integrating unfamiliar components.  Yes, continue.  Four others.
461/0:My new boss -- we call him Mr. Paladin.  He made me a Knight.
462/0:For Order's sake, hurry!
463/0:Upset enough to run away?
464/0:You will be gratified to hear that our test was successful.  Paul Denton has survived, and his biomod architecture has yielded a nearly perfect nanite predator.
465/0:What are you looking at?
465/1:Can I help you?
466/0:Serious.  Gob-zilla's history.  You've got a good shot at the title.
467/0:Are you feeling okay?
467/1:Why are you acting like this?
468/0:What the hell are you doing!?
468/1:Hey, get that away from me!
469/0:Move along.  This zone is restricted.
469/1:You shouldn't be here.
470/0:Hey!  We're on the same side!
470/1:Watch where you're aiming!
471/0:It was working correctly just a minute ago...
472/0:I'm not amused.
472/1:Was I not clear?
473/0:It was working correctly just a minute ago...
474/0:Here you go.  Name's Alex D.  [250 credits.]
475/0:It's a plain fact.  The WTO has meant more jobs and more access to other WTO cities' industries.
476/0:Stop jostling me.
476/1:Get away from me.
477/0:Maybe it blew a fuse...
478/0:You are not permitted to be here.  Get lost.
478/1:Leave the area immediately.
479/0:Maybe it blew a fuse...
480/0:Stop looking at me like that!
480/1:Go bother someone else.
481/0:Section 202... theft...
482/0:What is your problem?
482/1:Take your nonsense somewhere else.
483/0:Section 202... theft...
484/0:Somebody must be throwing things...
485/0:Somebody must be throwing things...
486/0:Wonder who left that lying around...
487/0:Wonder who left that lying around...
488/0:JC must be awakened.  
489/0:It may be surrender, but at least it's on our own terms and with a minimum of casualties.
490/0:Hasten to your destiny.
491/0:I like her music.  It's got attitude, unlike like most of the stuff you hear nowadays.
492/0:The Age of Light is at hand.  How lucky you are to have Mr. Dumier's favor.
493/0:For your information, I actually like lemon-lime.
494/0:These freaks came out of the Russian Famine.  They put their own survival ahead of any set of laws...
495/0:I said MOVE!
496/0:What could we possibly want to take from that abominable factory?  We detest what their industry does to the land.
497/0:I mixed it up with the Templars in the arcology.  Didn't learn much except that they aren't very good marksmen.
498/0:Is something going on?
499/0:
500/0:Where's SSC?  They're supposed to handle this sort of thing.
501/0:I will be watching from the sky.  After you find Paul, I will meet you in Flight Bay 23 at the top of the arcology.  Good luck.
502/0:Enough talking.  I have much to think about.
503/0:Get away from me!
503/1:Watch what you're doing!
504/0:Wanna see how YOU like being used for target practice?
504/1:Gah!  What is WRONG with you?
505/0:That's enough!  
505/1:Stop it!
505/2:Go away! 
506/0:That's it!
506/1:I've had it!
507/0:Hm, that looked like... hard to say.
507/1:Caught sight of SOMETHING...
508/0:Someone likes it dark...
509/0:That was a strange noise...
509/1:Sounded like movement...
510/0:Someone likes it dark...
511/0:Whoa, just ran into something...
512/0:Thought that light was off...
513/0:(grunt) Hey, I know how to defend myself!
513/1:(grunt) Just wait 'til I get my hands on you!
514/0:Thought that light was off...
515/0:I had no idea there was so much stress involved in working for a coffeehouse.  I should've guessed it -- the money was too good.
516/0:Luminon Saman will lead us.  He's a man of action, not ruled by fear, and he refuses to bow to the WTO.
517/0:What the--!
517/1:Yikes!
518/0:Section 113... breaking and entering...
519/0:
520/0:Nice try, but I'm trained to pick up on that sort of thing.
521/0:Section 113... breaking and entering...
522/0:Hmm.  That door was open.
523/0:Hmm.  That door was open.
524/0:Section 115... forced entry...
524/1:Someone must've wanted in pretty bad...
524/2:...E-e-h... Ever hear of a doorknob?
525/0:Section 115... forced entry...
525/1:Someone must've wanted in pretty bad...
525/2:...E-e-h... Ever hear of a doorknob?
526/0:Nothing you can give me will help Paul now.  I've joined the Templar cause.  I let them draw my blood and transport him away.
527/0:You can't control your own people?
528/0:I never imagined that all four of our facilities would be compromised at once.
529/0:Take me to Trier, Germany.
530/0:Alex.  You seem to have business in many different places.
531/0:
532/0:Each of them knows in his or her heart that something is still missing -- true order.  And soon, they will begin to seek it, and we will be there to help them.
533/0:Convergence... convergence... peace.
534/0:That's the head scientist.  Talk to him -- find out how to access the housing unit that contains the Mag Rail.  He may be the only one who has the necessary clearance.
535/0:At least the air has cleared up.  You must be the stranger everyone talks about, our part-time savior...
536/0:
537/0:Watch out -- it's a trick!
538/0:Some sort of smoke-screen...
539/0:Don't be fooled by the smoke.
540/0:I know what I heard, and I'm not falling for it!
541/0:It took several days before peace returned to the streets of Seattle, but there were no further disturbances afterward, although some of the tension lingers.
542/0:Someone's trying to distract us.  Get ready.
543/0:Hm, an altercation of some kind.
544/0:(sarcastic) Woo-hoo, some excitement.
544/1:... filthy animals...
545/0:Hm, an altercation of some kind.
546/0:Section 201... unreported microbial hazard.
547/0:Section 771... bringing heavy weapons into a restricted area.
548/0:Something upset the birds.... Hm.
549/0:Section 771... bringing heavy weapons into a restricted area.
550/0:Whatsa matter, little kitty?
551/0:There's been some shooting.
552/0:Yeah, I could use your help.  Follow me.
553/0:(sigh) ... if people wouldn't leave trash lying around... 
554/0:There's been some shooting.
555/0:Hm, a bolt.
556/0:We'll talk again when you have some news about my zoning petition.
557/0:Hm, a bolt.
558/0:Wonder who's been throwing knives...
559/0:So?
560/0:Wonder who's been throwing knives...
561/0:
562/0:What's available?
563/0:As the city of Trier gears up for the Order-WTO summit, Vera Maxwell, Executive Commander of the SSC has personally taken control of setting up security for the event.  In an interview with the World News Network, she had this to say:
564/0:If I give you guys some money, will you leave this guy alone?  [100 credits]
565/0:Seriously -- take the weapon-mod.  I'm done being a security operative.
566/0:Welcome to Tarsus Cairo.  I am Silas Archer, the Headmaster.  Can I help you?
567/0:Pardon the simplicity of this drawing, but I like to give newcomers a map so that they can find their way around.  The local business owners are always complaining that they don't get enough foot traffic.
568/0:Watch your step around here.  The locals mean business.
569/0:In the coming weeks, we will each be presenting new by-laws that will eventually create an interlocking relationship between the two groups, so that our coexistence will be complementary rather than conflicting in the future.
570/0:I've got my eye on you.
571/0:See ya later.
572/0:We will not be separated again.
573/0:Thought that was closed.
574/0:
575/0:Thought that was open.
576/0:Hm.  That wasn't on.
577/0:Go away!
578/0:Hm.  That wasn't off.
579/0:I checked out the VIP area.  It's a contact point for the Omar, the black market...
580/0:Jesus, what happened here...?
580/1:Section 231... destruction of private property...
581/0:Section 232... damage of private property...
582/0:That thing must be acting up or something...
583/0:You're scaring me, Alex.  Be careful what you go around telling people.  You might get yourself in trouble.
584/0:It's not working.  Huh.
585/0:Wonder who took it.
585/1:Section 202... theft...
586/0:What's the difference?
587/0:
588/0:Good to see the info made a difference.  Now let's see if tracking you down myself was worth the effort.
589/0:We will be more effective as a team.
590/0:Finally -- it's about time you woke up.  C'mon on in.  We've got to talk about what's been going on around here.
591/0:What do you mean "no comment"?  We're under attack!
592/0:Wonder where that came from...
593/0:Hm, that's not supposed to be there.
594/0:Wonder who turned out the light...
595/0:What's the connection to Mako?
596/0:Someone turned on the light...
597/0:The Knights Templar welcome you, friend.  Care to learn more about the Cause for Purity?
598/0:Now that I've activated what's left of ApostleCorp, what sort of future are you trying to bring about?  I've heard JC's version.
599/0:That door's supposed to be closed...
600/0:Who shut the door?
601/0:It's those R and D guys pulling late nights that bring in the numbers.
602/0:Section 115... forced entry...
602/1:Someone must've wanted in pretty bad...
602/2:...E-e-h... Ever hear of a doorknob?
603/0:Looks like there's been some fighting...
604/0:Hm, scorch marks.
605/0:Hm, bulletholes.
606/0:
607/0:No thanks.
608/0:Hey!  I live here!
609/0:Yeah.  Anything I should know?
610/0:They had some greasels in the lab for class and they got loose.  Surprise!  Those things aren't pet hamsters.  Anyway, there's some expensive equipment in there apparently -- some biomod stuff I think -- so they want the situation resolved quickly.
611/0:So the research is happening all over the world?
612/0:No skin off MY nose, though.  They still have to kiss my boots, and I plan to make them do it, too.
613/0:JC sleeps no longer.  The Hateful Ones have failed.
614/0:Someone's got a boltcaster.
615/0:Well, it makes no nevermind to ME, but I have a proposal.  This jet carries two Sunfire missiles.  I could take out the ground force of any group you tell me.
616/0:That looks like a throwing knife...
617/0:Hmmm.  Section 482... fire in an inappropriate location...
618/0:Looks like smoke.
619/0:Come to the tavern.  I have more to tell you about JC's condition -- and why you are so important.
620/0:Someone got wounded.
620/1:That blood's fresh.
621/0:Trouble in the Inclinator.  Some sort of spill.
622/0:I'm the Templar Grand Master.
623/0:What have they done to me?  I've never felt so weak...
624/0:Something's blocking the light...
625/0:I'm trying to be patient, but I still haven't received my RJ-4 nanomanipulators.  It's holding up the whole project.
626/0:We're probably looking at tightened security soon.
627/0:Hm.  A dead transgenic... 
628/0:What do you think you're doing?  I didn't see you pay on the way in.  You owe me 10 credits.
629/0:Something wrong with that bot...
630/0:My sculptures... Oh yes, I have plenty to tell him about my sculptures.
631/0:That bot's been hit.
632/0:They towed in some helicopter not too long ago.
633/0:Busted out?  You guys standing point for some sort of jailbreak?
634/0:Is that illegal?
635/0:Those Order freaks should just shut up and get real jobs.
636/0:As the city of Trier gears up for the Order-WTO summit, Vera Maxwell, Executive Commander of the SSC has personally taken control of setting up security for the event.  In an interview with the World News Network, she had this to say:
637/0:Where do you want to go?
638/0:You will have to ask Mr. Tong.  Shall we go?
639/0:It would be unsafe for me to approach any closer to the Mako Ballistics campus.  You will have to bypass the facility's defenses on your own.
640/0:Not in my job description.  Tell you what -- since it looks like the specialist is a no-show, I'll give you his fee if you take care of the job.  And I'll look the other way if some of the science stuff disappears.  A greasel must've eaten it, you know?
641/0:My children need to eat.
642/0:Ever heard the name Alex D?  They told me the same thing.
643/0:Well done in the arcology.  You have my gratitude.
644/0:You're nearing the toxic spill the facility director told you about.  The WTO is reaping the benefits of its harmful industries -- I guess a little pollution is all in a day's work up there.  The area's been closed off and they've deployed bots to patrol and secure it.  May Her Holiness watch over you as you face these obstacles.
645/0:Carry on.
646/0:Cleansing procedures complete.  Detox successful.
647/0:I turned up evidence that you've been perpetuating the plague in the medina -- by not allowing a counter-agent to be deployed.
648/0:Hey!  Who did this?
648/1:(gasp)
649/0:(gasp) ...must be unconscious...
650/0:Someone knocked this guy out!
651/0:Someone knocked this lady out!
652/0:Real funny.
653/0:You are modified.  Yes.  But only the Omar understand the true purpose of biomodification.
654/0:(gasp) A corpse!
654/1:Damn.  Murdered.
655/0:Someone knocked out a guard...
656/0:First they run me out of the Lord's house, then they chase me out of the tunnels.  (laugh)
657/0:(groan) Swell 11's  won.  What a way to die.
658/0:At least he's still alive...
659/0:At least she's still alive...
660/0:An Order terrorist might have poisoned the water supply.  Please, I must check the pipes.
661/0:Dammit.  I'm too late.
661/1:Someone murdered a guard...
662/0:Instruction set decoded.   Integrating unfamiliar components.  Yes, continue.  Four others.
663/0:Isn't it true that we are approaching a watershed moment in international affairs in which two great powers, separated so far by circumstance and the fog of reconstruction, finally begin to bump elbows?
664/0:She is a great leader and a great friend.  You completely misunderstand our work.  The Collapse would have been far more devastating if Nicolette and I hadn't accepted her family's legacy and rebuilt the Illuminati organization, which was nearly destroyed by MJ-12.
665/0:Thanks for the tip.  It sounds like you got yourself to safety just in time.
666/0:The WTO should crack down on these Templars.
667/0:No one's allowed past this point without the proper softkey ID.
668/0:Well, first of all, she wasn't young.  Hey, NG, I have a question.
669/0:With your abilities, you will appreciate our merchandise.  You may purchase now or earn an additional discount by providing another service to the Omar.
670/0:This one angry mech, his shipment showed up long after he left.  I don't think he'll be back to pick it up....
671/0:So we're the keys...  The gate must use some sort of DNA fingerprinting...  And since both Billie and I have Denton genetic code, we were able to use it...  It was never about the training, was it?  They were just perfecting the DNA...
672/0:At last...  Do not betray us, Denton.
673/0:So?
674/0:Tough break about Chicago.  I guess you knew people there.
675/0:
676/0:We get good prices now that the Omar moved in.
677/0:Let's find the bastard who did this.
678/0:He's already dead.  Nothing we can do.
679/0:She's already dead.  Nothing we can do.
680/0:Hm...
680/1:Strange...
681/0:This isn't right.
681/1:Hm, I wonder...
681/2:Not good.
682/0:Hm.  Better look again.
683/0:I definitely heard something.
683/1:Hm.  I can't just be hearing things.
684/0:I have no idea, but whatever it is, my figures suggest they're not paying nearly enough for transporting it via a WTO facility...  Maybe you'd have better luck?  A new face?  If you get the info to us, we can make it worth your while.  [200 credits]
685/0:I guess I just wasn't smart enough.
686/0:Keep an eye out.
686/1:We might have company.
687/0:Huh.  It's happening again.
687/1:Maybe I'm right after all...
687/2:Now what?
688/0:Guess it was nothing.
688/1:Oh well.
688/2:I'm imagining things.
689/0:Thank you, Chief Morgan.
690/0:We'll dispatch a crew to resolve the situation immediately.  Thanks for the tip.  You're entitled to an informant's reward, if you're interested.
691/0:Grand Master Saman has ordered us to treat you as an ally.
692/0:Don't be naive.  Search Nassif's apartment.  It will all become clear to you.
693/0:It's too bad about Chicago.  We were so close.
694/0:It was unbelievable -- SSC just hauled him off!  I wish I'd had my camera...
695/0:I never turn a customer away.  I think that's my prerogative as an entrepreneur.
696/0:Welcome back.  I just revived your brother JC in Antarctica.  Tracer Tong is coordinating with him from Germany.
697/0:
698/0:Nice.  You scout the place out, and I'll make sure we cross paths before the action starts.
699/0:Thanks.
700/0:I'll do what I can.  Maybe something like that distraction I staged a few months ago to keep everyone away from the vault?  Listen, you should know the WTO is pestering me to join the Elite Committees again.
701/0:You can't pass up this chance to help your fellow citizens.
702/0:I'll feel a lot better when we're out of this place.
703/0:False alarm.
703/1:I've got nothing.
704/0:Could've sworn I saw something...
704/1:Guess I'm seeing things.
705/0:Guess I'm hearing things.
705/1:Could've sworn I heard something...
706/0:Damn!  Must've slipped away...
707/0:They're gonna shut the Inclinator down completely.  I've been sayin' that since it was built.
708/0:Sneaky little beggar.
709/0:Lost him.
710/0:I killed the security chief, just as you asked.
711/0:Lost her.
712/0:Looks like they're about to close up.  See you next time.
713/0:Nothing.  We better give up.
714/0:This has been another... ta-a-alk BULLET!
715/0:Be ready in case the fool comes back.
716/0:A lady should not walk here alone.
717/0:Better watch my back from now on...
718/0:Mako isn't stupid.  They'll know they've been infiltrated if the entire bioinformatics team disappears overnight.
719/0:Universal.  Are you sure?  That would screw up the market pretty bad.  Why would Tarsus want to undercut their own product?
720/0:Is this Inclinator station under total lockdown?
721/0:That's right, you arrived and you're still there.  I saw you myself -- the real NG Resonance.  Trust me, you're not in any shape for a concert.
722/0:I'm proud I did what I could to stop that factory from polluting the earth -- but I'm not a thief.
723/0:So we wait.  While some greedy bald scientist ignores the plague to make pills for dieting, we wait.  Like stones in the desert, we are dead, waiting for nothing.
724/0:
725/0:We need to find the right balance between truth and persuasion -- between a complete science of mind and the value system that follows from it.
726/0:Doctrinal demands.  You must renounce all body-modification, nanotech, genetic, cybernetic -- everything.  And you must be ready to destroy the transgressors.
727/0:test
728/0:Are you kidding?  This is a top-secret lab.  Those are gold beams -- they're set up to flatline a person in about a quarter second.
729/0:I heard it's just one strain, a genetic experiment.  Company was called VersaLife.
730/0:
731/0:Looks like you need it, though.
732/0:Here and there you might find a survivor hiding behind automated security. but that's about it.
733/0:Have the Templars -- I mean, the Hateful Ones -- caused any other trouble for you since their arrival?
734/0:Get to work.
735/0:Sounds like you're in this for the adventure.
736/0:The reception area's at the front of the main building.
737/0:In any case -- glad to have you back.
738/0:What do you mean?
739/0:Mark my words.  The day is coming when it's going to be us versus them.  Human beings versus the freaks.  You didn't see horse-head cyborgs walking around ten years ago.
740/0:So I guess you've gone rogue on us.  It's not too late to show some loyalty to the WTO.   We want you to destroy the Nassif family's greenhouse.  Exit through the mosque on Level 108, then go west.  The experimental greenhouse, a violation of WTO regulations, should lead us to Dr. Nassif.
741/0:Trying to keep it safe around here.
742/0:Not yet.  I'll let you know.
743/0:
744/0:
745/0:One day they rent an apartment, then everyone's wearing bath robes and they have a church in the middle of town.
746/0:Helios is starting to sound like an enlightened despot.
747/0:I want you to see more evidence that the program is corrupt.  None of this had to do with our best interests; we were just their guinea pigs.  That's why I joined the Order.
748/0:Who the hell are YOU?  I made it clear to the Arcology Chairman that NG would not arrive until tomorrow and that regardless there would be no solicitations, no endorsements, and no appearances until showtime.
749/0:What's going on back there?
750/0:NG Resonance is playing a concert in the arcology tomorrow.  I need someone to convince her to endorse QueeQueg's.  From what I hear, her manager, Miss Withers, can easily be bribed.  Try to catch her waiting for NG and offer her some money.  If she accepts, I will compensate you with a choice of several weapon mods, which I found on a dead Omar.
751/0:The SSC is supposed to be about action.
752/0:The latest in our ongoing coverage of the missing persons reports at the Tarsus Academy in New Cairo.  The Headmaster, Silas Archer, has turned up dead.   
753/0:What if I wanted to take a look at the prototype?
754/0:Now watch the ceiling while I cut the power.
755/0:
755/1:
755/2:
755/3:
755/4:
756/0:Tarsus gave us a lot.  Maybe we owe them a chance to explain.
757/0:... citta... citta... citta...
758/0:She told me to send you into the medina -- the village -- to talk to the Omar in their hideout.  Supposedly they say that the WTO has technology to clean up the nanites but won't use it.
759/0:I don't mind taking them down one at a time.
760/0:I'll find a way out of this place.  Just give me time.
761/0:That's right.  Like Sir Francis Drake.  Like Sir Francis Bacon.  Like Sir.... uh, I can't remember what the other one was.
762/0:They're up to something...  and if it was in our best interest we wouldn't be kept in the dark about it.
763/0:Accusations of corruption are a serious matter, Alex.
764/0:Hurry up.  I get bored just sittin' like this.
765/0:Play the organizations against each other, and maybe you can find an agenda of your own.
766/0:Then why am I sick?  I exercise, eat right, I always wear my breather when I'm out in the medina...
767/0:My family may now finally be safe.
768/0:We will follow this breaking news story and bring you new developments to you as they happen.
769/0:Hi, NG, I hope you're listening.  I'd like to meet you for real sometime.
770/0:I heard he's one of their leaders, and they put him into a deep sleep to wait for something.  I don't know what, but it must be pretty important.
771/0:Got it.
772/0:If the Order isn't territorial, why do you maintain an armed guard?
773/0:Just move along so we can seal off the area.
774/0:The WTO favors Pequod's.  That is why they get all of the big contracts and will someday grind us into dust.
775/0:Gimme a bun -- you're already cooked.
775/1:Huh.  You're already shook.
775/2:Yeah!  Gonna cook you like a gob on a stick. 
776/0:(shout)  // startled
777/0:That will teach them.  
778/0:All mine.
778/1:Time to execute.
779/0:Get him!
780/0:No business can prosper without protection against crime.
781/0:Get her!
782/0:Representative democracy was sluggish and prone to corruption, the result of the technological limitations of previous centuries.
783/0:This one looks hungry.
784/0:A stinkin' greasel...
785/0:Come to mama, baby gob.
786/0:We may have our doubts but JC thinks you will truly help us all, so we will wait and watch.
787/0:A freakin' karkian...
788/0:One thing I am is dependable.
789/0:Didn't know dogs got braces...
790/0:All structures and life within the range of the weapon appear to be reduced to cinders.  It is not known if any evacuation procedures were successful.
791/0:May Her Holiness watch over you.
792/0:I checked out the VIP area.  No big deal.  Just a bunch of suits.
793/0:I have lived here all my life.  Trier has seen a lot of history, but nothing like this.
794/0:D for Upper Seattle Dandy?
795/0:I guess I can't complain if you aren't charging me.
796/0:Did you hear that they're trying to grow their own food down there?  Right in the middle of Nanite Swell 11.
797/0:These guys are mercenaries.  They pitch whatever creed their boss tells them to.
798/0:Watch for me from the air.  I have business in the arcology.
799/0:Is there another way out?
800/0:Did you see who startled it?
801/0:Thanks for being honest with me, Alex.  Somehow I know I can trust you.
802/0:Did you see who startled it?
803/0:Did you see what started this fire?
804/0:Did you see what started this fire?
805/0:Did you see who caused this skirmish?
806/0:Did you see who caused this skirmish?
807/0:Scorch marks...  Do you know what happened here?
808/0:Scorch marks...  Do you know what happened here?
809/0:Bullet holes...  Do you know what happened here?
810/0:One of the interns got gunned down one day.  He showed up a day before he was scheduled to start and wasn't in the database yet.
811/0:Stop.
812/0:Bullet holes...  Do you know what happened here?
813/0:... gettin' sick of you hangin' around...
813/1:I ain't goin' anywhere.
814/0:Done cryin' to your scabland mama?
814/1:Gotcha now...
814/2:That's right.  This ain't over.
815/0:Very good.  No more for now.  Our agents will begin watching you.  When they approve your security clearance, one of them will make contact.  Goodbye -- and may Purity prevail.
816/0:Not over yet...  // calling to buddy
817/0:You got a piece or what?
817/1:(laugh) Feeb brought a fist to a gunfight...
818/0:... put a cap in your scabby butt...
818/1:Quick -- duck!
819/0:My kill.
820/0:Got him lined up...
821/0:Got her lined up...
822/0:That sure was a quick ceremony.
823/0:JC is safer, but still he sleeps.
824/0:What are they paying you?
825/0:I checked out the school.  No sign of your daughter, but I killed the headmaster.  He was only pretending to be a school administrator.
826/0:You're right to be paranoid.  Stay here.  I'll let you know if I find out anything about the assassins.
827/0:A crossbow bolt?  Do you know where this came from?
828/0:A crossbow bolt?  Do you know where this came from?
829/0:Did you see how this got damaged?
830/0:Guess we have a new champion trainer.  If you ask me, something dirty went down tonight.  That's why Gob-zilla didn't show.
831/0:Did you see how this got damaged?
832/0:Look out, Alex!
833/0:It must be a sign of the end times!
834/0:Did you see how this got destroyed?
835/0:Did you see how this got destroyed?
836/0:Hmm...  Shut down...  Do you know what's going on here?
837/0:Hmm...  Shut down...  Do you know what's going on here?
838/0:JC Denton worked with the Illuminati?
839/0:Whoa.  That's acting weird.  Any idea what happened?
840/0:What's going on here?
841/0:Whoa.  That's acting weird.  Any idea what happened?
842/0:Well, it's my daughter, Mina.  Look at her!
843/0:You didn't hear this from me, but in case you want some spending money the employee ATM is in Cargo Bay 02 across the courtyard.  They never updated the firmware, which means it's pretty easy to hack, or so I've heard.
844/0:Hey, bot.  Target the scab -- there!
845/0:I guess politics don't matter much down here, where it's us against the mutants.
846/0:Time to bring the armor...
847/0:That med bot better get here quick.
848/0:Sure could use a repair bot.
849/0:Time to add a drone to the scenario...
850/0:No good.  Get out...
850/1:Think I'm crazy?  See ya later...
850/2:Forget it.
851/0:Sounds like a walk in the park.  You stay here and guard the entry.  I'll find Nassif.
852/0:Get the sides...
852/1:Cut the scab off!
853/0:Surround him!
854/0:At least we don't have to worry about Plague 11.  It's going to be such a relief to get outside.
855/0:Surround her!
856/0:Nothing is solved by foreigners coming here to sign useless treaties.
857/0:What do I need to do?
858/0:
859/0:You only have to pay once.
860/0:I'd take the east side of the island back from the Templars.
861/0:You may enter.
862/0:It's high time the Order and the WTO signed a non-aggression pact.  The treatment of Her Holiness should convince people of that much.
863/0:That isn't supposed to be on -- Any ideas what's going on?
864/0:This has been another... ta-a-alk BULLET!
865/0:That isn't supposed to be on -- Any ideas what's going on?
866/0:Hmmm...  That shouldn't be off.  Notice anything suspicious?
867/0:I'm here to make sure you deal straight with Miss Sak.
868/0:Hmmm...  That shouldn't be off.  Notice anything suspicious?
869/0:Eh?  How did this get open?  Do you know what happened?
870/0:That's twenty-three title matches. and look at her hide.  Barely a scratch.
871/0:It was nice to meet you.
872/0:Eh?  How did this get open?  Do you know what happened?
873/0:I'll pay your WTO dues if you'll give me that key.  [300 credits]
874/0:Why isn't this open?  Any ideas?
875/0:This is an historic moment that the SSC is proud to be a part of.  To demonstrate our commitment to making this a safe and productive meeting, I am flying to Trier myself to ensure that everything goes according to plan.
876/0:That didn't look right.
876/1:Bet someone's there.  Probably thought I wasn't lookin'.
877/0:Wake your ass up -- I saw something.
878/0:That's a freakin' weird noise...
878/1:Don't like the sound of THAT...
879/0:Not too fast.
879/1:On MY lead.  Move when I move.
879/2:Careful.  This is for real.
880/0:Don't feeb out on me.  Let's go...
880/1:Now!
880/2:Stay close.  Time to pick this scab...
881/0:Oh come off it!  I know your secret and I'm not going to let you get away with this.
882/0:Fed up with what they believe to be the pollution of the human genome by biomodification, and frustrated with the general public's refusal to respond to their message, the Templars have instead taken Cairo by force and by all accounts intend to enact their agenda through a military state.
883/0:You should leave.
884/0:Droppin' a stingball...
885/0:Lemme know how it goes with Miss Sak.
886/0:It's gonna blow!
887/0:Club Vox is pleased to offer a safe environment for conducting business.
888/0:A prox mine!
889/0:Come out, feeb.
889/1:Scared?  You oughtta be...
890/0:I hope it's gone...
891/0:Get ready.  Could be anywhere.
892/0:Looks like the Templars are still causing trouble.
893/0:The Age of Light is at hand.
894/0:Oh, sure.  It's some kind of prep school.  But that doesn't mean those girls don't know how to party.  I hear they sneak off to a secret room through a vent.  But don't tell the Headmaster...
895/0:Hi.  Bill Green.  Club Vox security manager.
896/0:I'll sleep better now.
897/0:Why not get rid of nanotech and genetic engineering, the technologies that make people different from each other?
898/0:That's my only reward -- a discount?
899/0:Number Two -- you stay in the VIP lounge.  No snooping around club offices.
900/0:Someone is reading too much into Chairman Dumier's concern for your leader.  He was simply being a good statesman by authorizing a rescue attempt.
901/0:Hey -- listen.
902/0:Whah!  What's that?
903/0:I heard this from someone who would know.  They probably want to break up the profit-sharing in secret, so guys like us never know we've been screwed.
904/0:(grunt) Feeb!  Show your face!
904/1:(grunt) What the -- !
905/0:You've always been good at making friends.
906/0:I have to guard the apartment, or I'd go to Club Vox myself.
907/0:(grunt) Scab's lightin' my ass UP!
908/0:Jeez, that's messed up.
909/0:Hey, man.  Don't look now...
910/0:They've got you so scared you might as well already be wearing the cortical interface.
911/0:The schedule's a bit backed up due to some unusual circumstances earlier that put a few flights on hold.
912/0:The hazardous materials are yet to be contained, yet an unidentified man did reactivate the Inclinator and travel through the spill. His motives remain unknown.
913/0:You grew up in hard times, Alex.  Don't let that make you into a cynic.
914/0:Yo, sis'.  Don't look now...
915/0:I ain't STUPID.
916/0:No thanks.
917/0:Tryin' to smoke me out, huh?
918/0:Scab dropped some smoke...  // warning
919/0:We'll find the scab.
920/0:We scared the dude away.
921/0:We scared the girl away.
922/0:That's right.  You better run.
922/1:Huh.  Squeak and scram like a greasel chick.
923/0:... another scabland blood-sucker gone away hungry...
924/0:I saw 'em go in, dressed like a bunch of loony-tunes.
925/0:This ain't over yet.
926/0:It's already taken care of.  QueeQueg's is going to have screaming kids lined up around the block.
927/0:Close...  // relief
927/1:Ha!  Missed.
927/2:Oh yeah?  Oh YEAH?
928/0:It's always like this, when he goes away...
929/0:The scab missed me...
930/0:What the -- that ain't normal...
930/1:Not the first time I took care of an over-equipped commando...
931/0:I -- I can see you!  // panic
932/0:This is a private facility.
933/0:Oh yeah?
934/0:This?  THIS is too much.  I can't believe it.
935/0:That's all you know about the leaders?
936/0:Shhh!  The sound barrier's down.
937/0:My grandma wouldn't fall for that with her hearing aid turned off.
938/0:What for?
939/0:Someone's idea of a joke.  Tryin' to scare us...
940/0:Somethin' scared it.  Better not be a gob creepin' around...
941/0:Whatever the Order may say, you're just a mercenary, not a hero.  Killing one scientist isn't going to end this project.  Someone else will just take on the development now, and without the WTO regulation, it will be very easy for them to sell the Mag Rail to the wrong people.  
942/0:Where to?  Going rate minus twenty percent.  [400]
943/0:That thing hasn't been dead long.
944/0:
944/1:
944/2:
945/0:Hm.  That wasn't open.
946/0:You must prepare -- we can offer you special resources.
947/0:Hm.  That wasn't closed.
948/0:Hang tight for now.
949/0:Maybe later.
950/0:Thought that was off.
951/0:Guess you were nothing special after all.  Just mercenaries.
952/0:Thought that was on.
953/0:Real pretty.  That's your face, feeb, soon as I find you!
954/0:Looks broke...
955/0:I wasn't so hot at the stealth maneuvers.  You go ahead.  I'll try to stay out of the way.
956/0:The black market biomod sounds great, but I haven't got the credits. [500]
957/0:In the bull's eye today -- Chairman Dumier of the WTO.  Welcome, Chairman, I admire what you've done for the world community.
958/0:I can't believe that madman, Saman, has transformed the Rauchstadt church into a barracks.
959/0:It blew up!  In mid-air!
960/0:Freak.
961/0:Moves too fast.  It ain't natural.
962/0:Must be some bioelectric field for confusing sensors...
963/0:Hey, buddy, you're starting to give me the creeps.
964/0:(grunt)
964/1:(grunt) No.  Like THIS.
964/2:(growl) Another scar...  Never won a beauty contest, anyway.
965/0:
966/0:(grunt) Ain't scrippin' ME...  // angry
967/0:I can take care of myself from here on out -- promise.
968/0:Aaeeiii!
969/0:(grunt) Got me...
970/0:(grunt)
970/1:(grunt) Damn...  // breathy
971/0:(grunt) Back me up, feeb!
972/0:I found out that the missing Tarsus children were just playing a prank.
973/0:I guess the Versalife scientists all fled after the Collapse?  Or maybe they died off.  No way to know for sure.  In the end, they got what they deserved, though.
974/0:I'll take the multitools. [200]
975/0:People want to believe certain things about their leaders.  That's always been our key to power.
976/0:We don't have time for many more delays.
977/0:Scabland bums... always stealin' something.
978/0:Nothing.  But that is probably part of the admissions process -- you have to be clever enough to discover that it exists.  Right now, I need to get back to my studying.  I have only put in twelve hours today.
979/0:
980/0:Someone must've messed with it.
981/0:Wonder why it's down...
982/0:Some feeb havin' a fit, I guess...
983/0:That wasn't there before...
984/0:I thought that light was on...
984/1:So you shut off the lights...  Ain't like I can't turn them back on...
985/0:I don't remember it being dark in here.
986/0:I don't remember it being dark out here.
987/0:Hey, who turned on the lights?
988/0:An open door....  Pretty amateur if this is a break-in.
989/0:I'll keep an eye out.
990/0:(groan)
990/1:(groan) No!
991/0:Here you go.  [500 credits.]
992/0:(groan) You get me, my pack get you...
993/0:Saw monsters dropping out of the attic in that alcove!
994/0:(groan) Oh, God, the gob's gonna get me!
995/0:(groan) Don't worry -- I'm not gonna die on you...
996/0:I have a ballistic silencer, appropriate for any caliber barrel.  Also a black-market biomod canister, enables non-Piezochem functionality.  I've also got an SMG machine gun.  As a preferred customer, you may purchase items at half-market price.
997/0:Gettin' burned... some kind of poison...
998/0:(scream)
999/0:My eyes...  // pained
1000/0:Was that s'posed to hurt?
1000/1:(laughs) Pretty weak...
1001/0:
1002/0:(grunt) 
1002/1:(scream) 
1003/0:Maybe the WTO's just getting too big.  System's not working as well as it used to.
1004/0:(grunt) Got me...
1004/1:(grunt) I can.... make it.... (gasp)
1005/0:I can't believe I let her talk me into coming here.
1006/0:And I'm right behind her.
1007/0:Don't trust this guy.  Keep looking -- we need to know Dr. Nassif's location.  Search the director's private office off this room for clues to her whereabouts.  A datacube or vmail may point the way. 
1008/0:I'm not sure what they do back here, but I'm supposed to make sure no one messes with it.
1009/0:Let's see what this drone can do...
1010/0:Dead.  One of his rivals in Germany.  You'll now be dealing with a Mr. Kirkpatrick.  The SMG shipment will arrive next week.
1011/0:Stick around and we're gonna be gob-meat.
1011/1:Ain't worth it.
1011/2:Scatter!  Go!  Go!  Go!
1012/0:Quit bunchin' up!
1012/1:Get over there!  Now!
1012/2:Cut the scab off!
1013/0:Our agents approached your parents, Klara, while you were still in utero because of certain genetic potentials we detected during your mother's prenatal exams.  Seizing upon this opportunity, we began the infusion process immediately, before you were even born.
1014/0:I'll think about it.
1015/0:Get in tight.  Go on.  Scab don't have rabies...  // testy
1015/1:A little more....  Don't freeze up on me now...
1015/2:Just stick together and keep moving.
1016/0:Wonder who shut the door.
1017/0:Ready... jump!
1017/1:Now, my killers.  Now!
1017/2:Go in!  Go in!
1018/0:Hm, a fire...
1019/0:Get him!  Now!
1020/0:More stinkin' smoke...
1021/0:Get her!  Now!
1022/0:Hm, blood.
1023/0:Sounds like an interesting man.
1024/0:Wonder whose shadow it is.
1025/0:Look out -- it's lit!
1026/0:Good, someone killed another one.
1027/0:Somebody's packin'...
1028/0:Most people around here think that if you don't get accepted to an enclave, you must be lazy.  I'm not so sure about that...
1029/0:Burn marks.... This better not be another anti-terror sweep.
1030/0:Looks like shootin'.  Too bad I missed it.
1031/0:(gasp)
1032/0:Seriously -- take the weapon-mod.  I'm done being a security operative.
1033/0:Oh yeah!
1033/1:See?  Game recognize game.  Before you even think it, I'm already there.
1034/0:I'm ready to leave as soon as the copter arrives.
1035/0:This don't scrip' with US.
1036/0:So I find that interesting.  Do you need a pilot?  I can land my helicopter in the courtyard in front of the SSC station.
1037/0:Let's see what you got, sis'.
1038/0:I better get back to work.
1039/0:Hurt me, big boy!
1040/0:Sir.
1041/0:I've stood up to worse.
1041/1:I got a bad feelin' about this.
1042/0:Move along.
1043/0:Are you certain?  A threat to Purity like this must not be tolerated.  We must identify new targets...
1044/0:The scab's got guts.
1045/0:He was a CUSTOMER.  He came to the club for recreational purposes.
1046/0:Yo, stay front.  No feebin' out.
1047/0:Oh God...
1047/1:Just my luck.
1048/0:You tryin' to KILL me?  What for?
1049/0:Maybe I'll do some sightseeing in New Cairo.  I'll let you know if I come across anything.
1050/0:You hear about almost nothing else these days except one group attacking another.
1051/0:Grenade!  Move!
1051/1:Get clear!
1052/0:Better stay clear -- it might blow...
1053/0:Lost the scab.  But not for long.
1053/1:I'll find your gob-eatin' sack of bones...
1053/2:Must be hiding...
1054/0:Where you hidin', gob?
1055/0:Some kind of bolt.  Hate to find out what one of THEM feels like.
1056/0:Sucka can't hide forever.  Let's spread out.
1057/0:Some scab's been throwing knives.
1058/0:Watch it.  Bet the scab tries to jump us.  It ain't over yet.
1059/0:That bot took a hit.
1060/0:Keep goin', boss.
1060/1:Bye-bye...  (laugh)  Like I say -- you can't scrip' it, better skip it.
1061/0:See?  You can't scrip' it in a straight fight.
1061/1:Didn't mean to scare ya off...
1062/0:Aw hell, a body...
1063/0:This ain't over yet.
1064/0:Some scab thinks he's real smart...
1065/0:Get it!
1066/0:My boss is such a complete jerk.  It's just a Pequod's coffeehouse.
1067/0:Patience.  Sometimes violence is necessary, but willful aggression brings none of us closer to true Order. 
1068/0:Yes.  I'm just another ordinary human being, like you.  My name is Nicolette Duclare.  
1069/0:Huh, a corpse...
1070/0:That's steep.  Nevermind.
1071/0:Out cold.  Scab's tryin' to be sneaky.
1072/0:Dammit...  Damn!
1072/1:Must've slipped up.  Real shame.
1073/0:Finally, a real fight.
1074/0:Brother's gone.  Nothin' we can do for him.
1075/0:Listen.  I might be able to use your help.  Think you could find your way to Liberty Island in New York?
1076/0:Rather adventurous of me to trust you, isn't it?  I haven't even read your file yet.
1077/0:I must save her!
1078/0:My most sincere gratitude.  Our family is in dire need of a friend.
1079/0:I don't know about this.
1079/1:Pull yourself together!
1080/0:Hi there...
1081/0:Sure you want to get dropped at Liberty Island?  I heard the place is haunted.
1082/0:Brother's ticked off.
1083/0:I hope the purification process reverses most of the damage.
1084/0:Chick's ticked off.
1085/0:Signals are mixed at Order headquarters in Lhasa, Tibet.  
1086/0:How's THAT feel?
1086/1:Uh-huh.
1086/2:Got a piece of ya, didn't I?
1087/0:That's what happens, feeb.
1087/1:Hurts, don't it?
1088/0:That sure was a quick ceremony.
1089/0:Check it out.  Scab sprung a leak.
1090/0:Citizens are reminded to stay clear of the Panzerwerks factory until the situation there has been resolved.
1091/0:Feeb just got his bell rung...
1092/0:Feeb just got her bell rung...
1093/0:Just how I like it -- up close and messy.
1094/0:Huh.  All right.  Guess one good turn deserves another.  Here you go.
1095/0:
1096/0:Can't scrip' it up close, huh?
1096/1:Do or die, feeb.
1097/0:The Omar are safe.  Thanks for the tip.
1098/0:I still don't have one.
1099/0:WTO Chairman Dumier is irredeemable.  He has led too many down the path of greed and disorder.
1100/0:Not bad.  What kind of mods?
1101/0:
1101/1:
1101/2:
1101/3:
1101/4:
1101/5:
1101/6:
1101/7:
1101/8:
1101/9:
1102/0:Every time I come here I get two prescriptions -- one for breather filters, one for meditation.
1103/0:(laugh) I think she's a little shook...
1104/0:(laugh) I think he's a little shook...
1105/0:The Illuminati's power has no foundation other than the confused opinions of their followers.
1106/0:Close one, but close only counts in grenades and greasel-spit, sucka.
1106/1:I didn't even blink.
1106/2:Whoa!  Almost got me there...
1107/0:Don't worry about ME...
1108/0:Sister's gone.  Nothin' we can do for her.
1109/0:Get the punk off me!
1110/0:Whoa -- never seen mods like that...
1110/1:Must be some sort of biomod.
1111/0:(grunt)
1111/1:(grunt) Now I'm MAD.
1111/2:(grunt) Hurt ME?  I hurt you times two.
1112/0:(grunt) Is that your best shot?
1113/0:Ow!
1114/0:I'm doing what I can to ease their suffering.
1115/0:(grunt) It's gettin' ugly...
1116/0:We appreciate your dedication.
1117/0:Oooooo, yeah...
1117/1:WHOever, WHATever, WHENever -- I'm there!
1117/2:That's what'cha call some hardcore scrippin'...
1117/3:Too easy.
1118/0:Sucka.
1119/0:Nice one.  The beacon's right there.  Fire it up, and Bob's your uncle!  I'll be down in half a second.
1120/0:Quit your bawlin'.  I took care of it.
1120/1:That's right -- I saved your ass.  You owe me.
1121/0:Feels good, doesn't it?  Now what?
1122/0:I'm not blaming you personally...
1123/0:Scab never come up against US before...
1124/0:Brother's dead.
1125/0:We offer only the finest technologies, and you will be able to get them at a discount because of your preferred customer status.
1126/0:Chick's dead.
1127/0:It better be dead.
1128/0:Oh yeah?  Oh yeah...?
1128/1:Somebody's gonna get cooked.
1129/0:Sure.
1130/0:We are about to show this guy what happens when you push Panzerwerks too far....  Keep walking.
1131/0:Think you can scrip' it against ME?
1131/1:This ain't the first time I been in a fight, you know.
1132/0:Scab don't scare ME.
1133/0:I'm gonna scream...
1134/0:Yeah, and lose some of our own in the process.  It's not worth it.  On the other hand, if we wait it out, they'll get nervous, do something stupid, and come to us.  Why waste our energy and resources when we can have it that way?
1135/0:You cannot defeat Order.
1135/1:I will meditate on your spirit once I kill you.
1135/2:Too bad you cannot be saved.
1135/3:Is your spirit ready to be freed?
1135/4:Her Holiness watches over me.  You are doomed.
1135/5:Make peace with yourself.  Your time has come.
1136/0:So I'm on my own.
1137/0:Oh -- well, they really aren't doing ME much good, true... but I can't bear to be completely defenseless.  You'll have to make do with what I gave you.
1138/0:(grunt) Get him off me!
1139/0:I know all the tenants and you're clearly not one of them.  You better have honest business here.
1140/0:(grunt) Get her off me!
1141/0:Hey, thanks.
1142/0:(grunt) Gob's on my ASS!
1143/0:(grunt)
1143/1:(grunt) (growl) // angry
1143/2:(grunt) Damn...  // breathy
1144/0:Maybe I plan to kill him, like the Illuminati want me to.
1145/0:(grunt) DO somethin', yo...
1146/0:She brings destruction with her.  I hope you can end it.
1147/0:(groan)
1147/1:(groan) No!
1148/0:(groan) I was just kiddin'!
1149/0:(groan) It's too strong!
1150/0:Aaagh!  Some kind of poison!
1151/0:(scream)
1152/0:I'm telling the truth.
1153/0:Report to Tarsus C-14.  You'll need to debrief there.  We're still searching the wreckage at B-5, but we're not hopeful. The extent of the damage in Chicago is significant.
1154/0:Here you go.  My mom said this map would get me in trouble.  Boy, was she wrong.
1155/0:Certainly not.  I live here in Trier.  Seekers here don't care very much for this notion of a summit.
1156/0:And the plague lasted for years.
1157/0:
1158/0:What a happy ending.
1159/0:This ain't too professional, Red.
1160/0:You've already uploaded the Aquinas specification.  All I need you to do is make sure both Denton brothers have been neutralized and their machine destroyed.  The world doesn't need any new gods.
1161/0:Likewise.
1162/0:It's a powerful thing, seeing a great leader stand there speechless.  He was utterly shaken by the news.
1163/0:Here's the money to mark the map.  [200 credits]
1164/0:The Templars are not murderers.  We passionately want what's best for humankind and realize these dire circumstances demand certain...sacrifices.  
1165/0:Why did you expect to find an international airport?
1166/0:All part of SSC duties.  I can't comment except to say the situation will be under control shortly.
1167/0:All of our secrets are contained in the cells of your body, but no one will be able to make use of them without JC's help.
1168/0:... got me in the eyes!
1169/0:Ha!  Look at me!  Not a scratch!
1169/1:Lucky I know how to take a hit.
1170/0:(grunt) 
1170/1:(howl) 
1171/0:(grunt) Damn!
1172/0:I have delivered my message.  You will have to wait for Mr. Kirkpatrick.
1173/0:
1174/0:(gasp)
1175/0:Someone's gonna get juiced.
1175/1:Back to the scablands, pup.
1176/0:Bring the pain, Jane!
1177/0:Start the show, bro'!
1178/0:Think I'm scared?  I ain't scared.  // unsure
1178/1:This is gettin' serious.
1179/0:Well done.  Enjoy.  Even though they run on normal energy cells, your systems are far more efficient than the standard Piezochem architecture.  Now get down to the street.  The elevator on this level uses the lab's general access code -- 3445.
1180/0:You destroy my hydroponics equipment, and now you want to look after my daughter?  What?  You expect me to give you my parental code to the school so you can check up on her?  Hmph!
1181/0:Ain't no random feeb...
1182/0:I want to see Dr. Nassif.
1183/0:After what I made on this fight?  I'm buyin' a steak dinner -- for me AND Shutterbug.
1184/0:Then, talk to the woman in the air terminal information booth -- she works for us.  We will tell her that you are coming.  Say to her simply that you "have a friend in common."  Once inside the terminal, locate the armor and upload the schematic.  You will also find your cure.
1185/0:Let's talk about you.
1186/0:Warning: Greenhouse atmosphere beyond safe boundaries.  
1187/0:I make sure no one causes any problems.
1188/0:What the hell are you doing?!  You're violating a WTO directive!
1189/0:Well done, Alex D.  I just read in your file that of all the trainees Dr. Nassif picks you as the most likely to support our objectives.  She appears to have been right.
1190/0:Gotta keep walking this same crappy beat.
1191/0:She will do no more harm.  
1192/0:The Omar appreciate good customers.
1193/0:Come on.  We gotta MOVE on this...
1194/0:I knew I shoulda took off...
1194/1:Oh hell...
1195/0:What news?
1196/0:Whatever it is -- I didn't do it!
1197/0:...according to plan.  I had some trouble on arrival, owing to a group of Versalife monstrosities, but it was easy enough to sneak past them. Why Denton would want those awful little things around, I have no idea. 
1198/0:I was just kiddin', man!
1199/0:What next?
1200/0:I was just kiddin', girl!
1201/0:We're cooked!
1201/1:All I know is: today ain't my day to die.  Don't care how bad it looks.  I always pull through.  // solemn, worried
1202/0:Alex Denton.  JC said I was one of the MJ-12 experiments.
1203/0:Don't run out on me, man.
1204/0:Don't run out on me, girl.
1205/0:Looks like things are getting back to normal.
1206/0:This is your first time in New Cairo?
1207/0:Groovy.
1207/1:Ba-boom!
1207/2:Juice!
1207/3:That works.
1208/0:Like juicin' gobs in a gutter...
1208/1:Just a warning shot.  (snicker)
1209/0:You must know all the ins and outs of this building.
1210/0:Which is why we can pass through the Gate and enter this place.
1211/0:Someone inside the Tarsus program broke ranks.  By now at least a half-dozen groups are on our tail.
1212/0:Her Holiness will be pleased -- and you will be rewarded.  Praise Order, praise your loyalty.  Now, back on the trail of Dr. Nassif.  Our investigators have traced her contacts to the biolab at the top of the elevator on the north end of the complex.  Look for evidence there.
1213/0:Everything satisfactory, young man?  I am the owner.
1214/0:A big show to distract everyone from the fact that the system is broken -- both the Order and WTO.  I filed a lawsuit under both jurisdictions, and all it's done is sit in a drawer somewhere.
1215/0:Clearly, anyone capable of planning such an operation --
1216/0:Amid the safe...  Amid the predictable...  Amid the sleepy and the sheltered, one place stands apart.
1217/0:So do you need a lift?  I was in Cairo looking for someone, but he isn't here.
1218/0:I really shouldn't be talking while I'm on watch.
1219/0:I'm your friend, Alex.  The more I know, the better I can protect you.
1220/0:This is what you were talking about at the Nine Worlds Tavern.
1221/0:Sorry, I'm not your exterminator.  What's going on?
1222/0:You just cannot trust those Order freaks.
1223/0:Hold your fire!  I want to hear what you have to say for yourself.
1224/0:Guess I better check out the Greasel Pit.
1225/0:You're hired.  I need a lift to Trier, Germany. [500 credits]
1226/0:Welcome.  The Omar trader is ready to conduct business.
1227/0:Plague 11 is history.  Now people are running TO the medina.
1228/0:
1229/0:
1230/0:It's YOUR life, man...
1230/1:Stuck him pretty good...
1231/0:It's YOUR life, lady...
1231/1:Stuck her pretty good...
1232/0:See that shot?  Man!
1233/0:Thinks he can scrip' it in the badlands...
1234/0:Thinks she can scrip' it in the badlands...
1235/0:Like huntin' owls, if they weren't extinct.
1235/1:Gobs are always in season...
1236/0:Ha-ha-ha!!!  Scared?
1237/0:You should understand the history of the Aquinas system before considering such an irrevocable action.  Return to the control room, and I will contact you by holocomm.
1238/0:Memorize my face; it's the last thing you're gonna see.
1238/1:Do or die, scab.
1239/0:Oooooo, yeah...
1239/1:Get up!  Come on -- get up and fight! 
1239/2:Damn, I was just gettin' into a groove.
1239/3:MAN.  Ugly way to die.
1240/0:Something wrong?
1241/0:Ain't no one walks away from ME.
1241/1:Scab.
1242/0:I know we can hold out, but only for so long.
1243/0:Take me to the Mako Ballistics facility north of the city.  [500]
1244/0:
1245/0:We don't have time for many more delays.
1246/0:I'm studying for a test.  Do you mind?
1247/0:Without an Omar presence in WTO enclaves, the black market cannot operate internationally.  Shall we conduct business?
1248/0:... some bizarre stuff... not sure what they were doing here...
1249/0:That's very generous.  What's the Omar's objective?  Space exploration?  What was that thing at club Vox?
1250/0:
1251/0:I hope someone does something before it's too late.
1252/0:We will try to help you as you helped us.
1253/0:Do not betray the trust of the Illuminati.
1254/0:Sorry -- can't talk.  Boss is on the prowl.
1255/0:
1256/0:Cooked him like a scabland greasel.
1256/1:Wonder where HE learned to fight...
1257/0:What kind of beam-trigger is it?
1258/0:Cooked her like a scabland greasel.
1258/1:Wonder where SHE learned to fight...
1259/0:... saved your ass AGAIN.
1259/1:Check it out.
1259/2:Cool.  It's done.  I'll split the take with you.
1260/0:Er... So I guess you've heard about Eeva and Jennifer?
1261/0:Huh... a pretty one... out slumming, I guess.
1262/0:We got the scab.
1263/0:Gob don't scare ME.
1264/0:You are on the verge of fulfilling the promise of the Denton experiment.
1265/0:Oh yeah?  Oh yeah...?
1265/1:What-ever, how-ever -- I'm ready.
1265/2:Time to make some juice...
1266/0:I've got a black-market biomod canister, enables non-Piezochem functionality.  If you choose this item, we will direct you to a drop site for it after you have paid. Or you could take three scrambler grenades, which produce viral electronic transmission that affects bots, and temporarily switches their alliances.  And I've also got five multitools, used to bypass security devices, like keypads, cameras, and turrets, and to pick electronic locks.  All are available for market price.
1267/0:Think you can scrip' it against ME?
1267/1:Look at yourself: snoozin' like a karkian in the dark...
1268/0:Ever been in a fight, bro'?  Serious.  Ever been in a fight?
1269/0:I guess you just need to know the right people to get anything done.
1270/0:
1271/0:Ever been in a fight, sis'?  Serious.  Ever been in a fight?
1272/0:You're asking me to murder an enclave citizen?
1273/0:Not likely.  The Templars have cells all over the medina.  But maybe you got the one who would've tipped the balance.  Thanks for sticking your neck out.  I'll split my first combat bonus with you if these Omar make it through the raid.
1274/0:Since when are there half a million Templars?  That's as big as the security force of the WTO.
1275/0:At least greasels have some personality.
1276/0:I did give myself some extra overtime pay, though, heh heh, to make up for all that I had to do around here back then.
1277/0:I'm staying RIGHT HERE.
1278/0:No more violence!  We are all friends of JC.
1279/0:A tissue scan, please.  The biological properties could be used to improve Omar adaptability.  Or would you prefer to make a purchase now?
1280/0:You're a well-tooled little automaton.  Even to you, every fiber of your being seems fitted together to fulfill some purpose you only dimly understand.
1281/0:Watch and learn, yo.
1282/0:We're trying to create a new peace, where everyone has access to goods that they need, and has a mutual interest in keeping commerce flowing.
1283/0:Ain't lost my touch.
1283/1:Not then, not now, not ever!
1284/0:You?  Pickin' a fight with me?  (laugh)
1284/1:Oughtta save you for the greasel pit.
1284/2:Just me and you, scabland juice.
1285/0:See?  Hang like a pack and we win.
1286/0:What you waitin' for?  Cook this feeb.
1287/0:I'm gonna do it.  You can't talk me out of it.
1288/0:Dude's cooked.
1289/0:This is no place to light a fire...
1290/0:Great doing business with you.
1291/0:Chick's cooked.
1292/0:This is no place to light a fire...
1293/0:Ain't so scary now, gob.
1294/0:Wonder what's causing the smoke.
1295/0:Check it out: endangered species.
1296/0:(grunt)
1296/1:(grunt)
1297/0:Wonder what's causing the smoke.
1298/0:Hm, a trail of blood.
1299/0:Hm, a trail of blood.
1300/0:Someone oughtta be more careful about casting shadows...
1301/0:Someone oughtta be more careful about casting shadows...
1302/0:It's you!  This time I'll make sure you don't walk away.
1303/0:We shouldn't have... relied on these things!  Oh God!
1304/0:
1305/0:You must be here for the Summit.
1306/0:I can tell when a man's had some combat training... HAVE TO in my business.
1307/0:I understand your anger because of the WTO's sloppy waste management, but this destruction serves no one.  Now the hazard flush system is the only way to clean this up.  You also could just try powering up the system from the Director's office, but then you'd have to brave the cloud to get to the keypad to activate the Inclinator itself.
1308/0:Tarsus is a front for something called ApostleCorp.  They gave us an experimental biomod architecture -- one that can supposedly reconfigure anybody's DNA to accept nanite infusions.
1309/0:There's been a hazardous spill on the Inclinator platform.  No travel to Lower Seattle.  Not that that's a bad thing...
1310/0:The chopper should arrive soon.  Thanks for your hard work.
1311/0:
1312/0:
1313/0:We never hurt anyone, just the machines.
1314/0:I found the key some time ago.  I will be using your eyes and ears to gather more data.  As compensation, if you need a pilot for any reason I will be available.
1315/0:Excellent.  My technicians on Ophelia are already configuring the first operational Aquinas Hub in a generation... one which is in orbit and safe from tampering.
1316/0:No!
1316/1:Come on, punk.  Try that on me!
1317/0:Stand deep -- we still got the numbers.
1318/0:Our faith spread like wildfire just after the Collapse, but now everywhere I go I see skepticism.
1319/0:Brother's down...
1320/0:I wanna join.  Sign me up.
1321/0:See you right outside.
1322/0:Sis went down...
1323/0:Stinkin' gob -- you're DEAD!
1324/0:George wasn't even around to sign for it.  The more you talk about it, the more I think we should look into it.  Someone's probably trying to get around WTO import regulations again.
1325/0:It's gonna eat him!
1326/0:...filthy beast...
1327/0:When this is all over, they'll call us heroes and saints.
1328/0:It's gonna eat her!
1329/0:...filthy beast...
1330/0:See.  You can scrip' a hit when you have to.
1330/1:(giggle) Bet that stung.
1331/0:Headquarters made it clear -- no exceptions.
1332/0:You're deadly, girl.
1333/0:Something wrong with that bot...
1334/0:You're deadly, bro'.
1335/0:Something wrong with that bot...
1336/0:There's something you don't know about the Tarsus experiments.
1337/0:That bot looks beat-up.
1338/0:That bot looks beat-up.
1339/0:Now I understand.
1340/0:Take it out!  It's been corrupted.
1341/0:Eye for an eye!
1341/1:So this is the one that did it.
1341/2:Your turn to die!
1341/3:You dare murder a Knight...?
1342/0:(gasp)  A body...
1342/1:Oh my God!
1343/0:Uh, sorry.
1344/0:Excellent.  You've done much to bring peace to this neglected part of the city.  Maybe you can find Sid Black at the Greasel Pit bar to give him the good news about his jet.
1345/0:(gasp)  A body...
1345/1:Oh my God!
1346/0:Parents are in an uproar over the discovery that Silas Archer was actually a member of the fanatic anti-biomodification group, the Knights Templar.  
1347/0:Any questions?
1348/0:
1349/0:
1350/0:When you're done here, you just need to leave.  The exit sensors will take care of weapon reactivation.
1351/0:I think we both know what we're talking about.  I'm a representative of the Omar black market.  I can arrange a meeting if you wish.
1352/0:I think this is just an old storeroom they tried to fix up.
1353/0:What for?  I think I'd find more work in Europe.
1354/0:Sure, make a run at the Statue.  [250]
1355/0:Hold on -- I can't carry anything else right now.
1356/0:Guess Trier's the party town right now -- globablization secret meetings, riots, good beer...  Catch you at the terminal, eh?
1357/0:It's done.
1358/0:Hopefully we'll get a bit more mileage out of you than we did from that Adams chick.
1359/0:Huh.  Still breathing, at least...
1360/0:The Helios AI has the processing power to handle all governmental functions worldwide, legislative, executive, and judicial.  Once every mind has been enhanced and can merge with the AI, attitudes toward major legislation can be processed on a daily or even more frequent basis.
1361/0:Good work, Tarsus lady.  Here's your compensation.  I wonder what lucky corporations get to hire the Tarsus grads.
1362/0:Huh.  Still breathing, at least...
1363/0:No, but I've heard from Billie.  She seems to be mixed up with the Order Church.
1364/0:He's unconscious!
1365/0:Live -- from Cairo, where the Headmaster of a Tarsus Academy has been reported to the SSC as a threat to the students he oversees.
1366/0:He's unconscious!
1367/0:She's unconscious!
1368/0:You have been conditioned by this society.  You suffer from vasana, my seekers.  Hindu yogis have also warned their students of this flaw.  You are too attached to the superficial and the material.  Let me help you discover your true selves.  Turn away from this false sense of self-limitation to know your true self.  
1369/0:She's unconscious!
1370/0:I was the one who convinced her it was time for a summit.  Ultimately, I'm to blame.
1371/0:So you're modified?
1372/0:You're registered to receive a monetary reward.  I can be your cashier if you wish.
1373/0:A body!
1373/1:Looks like I came across a murder...
1374/0:A body!
1374/1:Looks like I came across a murder...
1375/0:This was a historic day.
1376/0:No matter what, Her Holiness leads this church.  We can accomodate a range of ideas under her leadership.
1377/0:It's an officer of the WTO, knocked unconscious...
1378/0:You hear about almost nothing else these days except one group attacking another.
1379/0:It's an officer of the WTO, knocked unconscious...
1380/0:That was a pretty low trick you played on the world, taking advantage of the Collapse to seize power and then deceiving people with a phony conflict between business and idealism.
1381/0:If only you were right, but I think you make them too human in your imagination.  A cyborg doesn't get discouraged.
1382/0:But what about the apartment?
1383/0:(sigh)  Thank God.  I'm gonna lose my edge if I stand here any longer.
1384/0:
1384/1:
1384/2:
1384/3:
1385/0:Please show yourself the way out.
1386/0:I don't think so.
1387/0:With our technology, we are ready.
1388/0:We will hold it this time.
1389/0:Snake-eyes all the way.
1390/0:I see.  So what exactly do you know about this new program?
1391/0:We were not all engineered the same.  Different strains had different purposes -- some are more verbally adept, others made for battle, and others made as leaders.  JC's arrival only amplified these differences.  His presence has changed us all.
1392/0:I guess I do not have the right pedigree to live with you rich types.
1393/0:Let's hang out again sometime!
1394/0:Very well.  Use the Englishman this time, but in the future remember that I am at your service.
1395/0:The WTO will be here shortly to take me into custody.  There's nothing more you can do here.
1396/0:What's the DIFFERENCE?  That's exactly the attitude that opens the door to tyranny in a free state -- remembering only what was said on the last talk show.  What's the value of a free press when attention spans are so short?
1397/0:From what I saw of Archer's files, the Templars will stop at nothing.
1398/0:Someone killed a guard...
1399/0:Someone killed a guard...
1400/0:Sure.  NG loves hearing from her fans.
1401/0:No active weapons in the Greasel Pit. First I gotta transmit the safety-lock codes to freeze anything you're carrying.  Then I let you in.  Otherwise, take a hike.
1402/0:My people are ready.  Step into the machine inside the Statue, and they will modify your nanite architecture into a delivery vehicle for our cellular defense mechanism.
1403/0:(sigh) We have a casualty.
1404/0:We want to return to our kind.  No more pain and experiments.
1405/0:(sigh) We have a casualty.
1406/0:Huh...
1406/1:Eh?
1406/2:I doubt it's anything.
1407/0:Huh...
1407/1:Eh?
1407/2:What?
1407/3:Hm...
1407/4:I don't know...
1407/5:That was odd.
1407/6:I wonder...
1408/0:All right...
1408/1:Someone there?
1408/2:Better pay attention.
1408/3:Am I imagining that?
1408/4:There it goes again...
1409/0:All right...
1409/1:Someone there?
1409/2:Better pay attention.
1409/3:Maybe I'm on edge?
1410/0:Hm.  I can't just be seeing things.
1411/0:Hm.  I can't just be seeing things.
1412/0:Excellent work, Alex.  Repair this Tower of Babel, and just when the King reaches out to touch the sky, we will be there to snatch his hand away.
1413/0:Instead we're trying to protect world leaders...and failing.
1414/0:Hey -- I'm a fan.  You're not supposed to argue with me.
1415/0:Pequod's is on the cutting edge of nutrition and biomedicine.  Our coffee will whiten your teeth and protect against ulcers.
1416/0:
1417/0:Step into the chamber.  It's time.
1418/0:Then do it.
1419/0:Ready when you are, Alex.  Look for me on the roof.
1420/0:Lovely.  I already scouted the area.  Get ready for a tight squeeze on the ground.
1421/0:I'm stuck in food products.  My father is VP of Marketing for a WTO-chartered syndicate.
1422/0:But I TALKED to Mr. Paladin, one-on-one.  He laid it all out, straight up.
1423/0:If you're meeting someone, you still need to check in at reception.
1424/0:Now I KNOW I heard something.
1425/0:Now I KNOW I heard something.
1426/0:Not a bad way to make a living, compared to what's out there.
1427/0:Maybe something's up.
1428/0:Thanks.
1429/0:Maybe something's up.
1430/0:Hm, it's happening again...
1430/1:Maybe I'm right after all...
1430/2:Now what?
1431/0:Hm, it's happening again...
1431/1:Maybe I'm right after all...
1431/2:Now what?
1432/0:Guess it was nothing.
1432/1:(sigh) Got the blood pumping, at least.
1432/2:Hm.  Had me goin' there.
1433/0:Guess it was nothing.
1433/1:(sigh) Got the blood pumping, at least.
1433/2:Hm.  Had me goin' there.
1434/0:Forget it.
1435/0:Forget it.
1436/0:You really round up freaks and murder them?
1437/0:Fair warning -- we're all a little on edge.  The SSC station is under high-alert.
1438/0:
1439/0:Don't worry -- your children are about to inherit your breathers.
1440/0:Here.
1441/0:
1442/0:I guess I'm not the only one.  Are you still sitting in your helicopter on the landing pad?
1443/0:That takes care of our would-be Napoleons.  Now destroy JC's machine and let's get out of here.
1444/0:She bears many tools and much anger.
1445/0:
1446/0:I looked around the school.  Listen, there's no other way to say this -- your daughter's dead.
1447/0:I have business to attend to.
1448/0:The plasmids for the neonatal experiment are off the charts again.  Can you give me a hand with them?
1449/0:I guess it's all about casting the widest net.
1450/0:My eyes must be playing tricks on me.
1451/0:I knew it!  That man's made a fool out of me for the last time.  By tomorrow he'll be eating rats out of a QueeQueg's dumpster -- mark my word!  Here's your reward.
1452/0:My eyes must be playing tricks on me.
1453/0:Just so long as it doesn't come to open war.  Seems like every day someone else is building an army.
1454/0:Hm.  Thought I heard something.
1455/0:Hm.  Thought I heard something.
1456/0:Better not come through HERE again...
1457/0:Oh, okay.  Well it is good to hear they are safe.  I will keep their secret.
1458/0:Better not come through HERE again...
1459/0:Wonder who that was.
1460/0:Wonder who that was.
1461/0:It's not worth it!  Run!
1462/0:Heh.  Scared him off.
1463/0:Heh.  Scared him off.
1464/0:Excellent -- you made it out.  Now you see why most cities have a transgenics problem.  A dozen laboratories like this were abandoned all around the world...
1465/0:Right on.  Code's 5543.  Just don't get yourself shot like the last guy.
1466/0:If you leak anything to the press, don't mention my name.
1467/0:Anybody I know?  I spent a right many days in that town with this girl Cindy and her mangy friends.
1468/0:How will JC get there?
1469/0:I wouldn't stick my neck out if I was you.  These are powerful people.
1470/0:What are you going to do?
1471/0:Primary objective:  Guard premises.  Special target:  Alex D.
1472/0:
1473/0:Dammit -- the assailant got away.
1473/1:The maniac better be gone.
1474/0:Don't worry, we'll find the maniac.
1475/0:Guess the killer got away.  // disgusted
1475/1:I'll get another chance, then we'll see who does the killing.
1475/2:The killer will turn up -- eventually...
1476/0:Another crook who got away with something.
1476/1:Damn beggars think we owe them a living.
1476/2:That's the last time a thief gets away on MY watch...
1477/0:Funny...
1477/1:...wonder what to make of THAT...
1477/2:Hmmm... Activity?
1477/3:Better check this out.
1478/0:Heh.  Scared her off.
1479/0:The new era will be one of true equality.
1480/0:We better take a look.
1481/0:Heh.  Scared her off.
1482/0:This isn't funny.
1482/1:That's right -- you better hide.
1482/2:Hm, not there...
1482/3:Am I getting warm?
1482/4:... around here somewhere...
1483/0:Guess I missed out on some action.
1484/0:No thanks.
1485/0:No complaints.
1486/0:This area's hot.
1486/1:Spread out.
1486/2:We'll find the beggar.
1486/3:Get ready for some action.
1487/0:Guess I missed out on some action.
1488/0:I know when I see something.
1488/1:Now I'm sure I saw something...
1489/0:Next time I drop the thug.
1490/0:Just caught another glimpse of something.
1491/0:Next time I drop the thug.
1492/0:Just let me know when you're ready.
1493/0:Don't presume to tell the Minister of Culture how to treat young talent.  I have my own plans for the pretty little fool.
1494/0:Code 021 -- assault.  And he better not think I won't write it up...
1495/0:Code 021 -- assault.  And he better not think I won't write it up...
1496/0:That landing pad is run by a local smuggler, Sophia Sak.  Looks like they seized Sid Black's harrier -- probably as payment for phony debts.  It never hurts to have a pilot who owes you a favor.  You could pay the debt or -- better -- eliminate Sak and her henchmen for the good of the whole neighborhood.
1497/0:Code 021 -- assault.  And she better not think I won't write it up...
1498/0:Thinkin' you'll take the Oath?
1499/0:Code 021 -- assault.  And she better not think I won't write it up...
1500/0:All new associations of citizens infiltrate the old ones, rather than exposing themselves to the sort of chaos we witnessed in Chicago.
1501/0:You may pass, but only because Grand Master orders it.
1502/0:The Code Yellow health advisory for Old Cairo remains in effect.  Like last year at this time, we are anticipating an upgrade to red over the course of the next few weeks.  
1503/0:You know, what's really going on...
1504/0:
1505/0:Tarsus Academy:  Preparing the next generation for the world.
1506/0:I can hardly believe it is true.  The Headmaster WAS plotting against us.
1507/0:I started feeling sick the moment that stuff spilled.
1508/0:You got my attention -- I'm all ears. 
1508/1:One more little noise...
1509/0:I heard something over here.
1510/0:Me and NG?  We both grew up misunderstood.
1511/0:Hey!
1511/1:Trouble!
1511/2:Not so fast...
1512/0:Just rumors.  But is it true?  Did she make a secret alliance with the WTO?
1513/0:You should know something.  Pequod's and QueeQueg's are separate brands of the same coffeeshop chain.
1514/0:An intruder!
1514/1:That's right -- I'm comin' for ya.
1515/0:Sir!
1516/0:The killer must be long gone by now.
1516/1:Lost the murderer...
1516/2:Must be a professional assassin to give me the slip like that...
1517/0:Ma'am!
1518/0:The killer must be long gone by now.
1518/1:Lost the murderer...
1518/2:Must be a professional assassin to give me the slip like that...
1519/0:There are several ways to put an end to the Nassif family's illegal food production.  Destroying the filter system will kill the plants or you can destroy them directly.  You could also reprogram the software that automates the greenhouse.
1520/0:Contact!
1520/1:This way!
1521/0:That's the last time a thief runs circles around ME...
1521/1:Damn crooks...
1522/0:This area is off-limits!
1523/0:That's the last time a thief runs circles around ME...
1523/1:Damn crooks...
1524/0:Section 104... evading the police!
1524/1:I'm on your tail!
1525/0:Something's going on...
1525/1:Hey... is someone there?
1525/2:... won't catch ME sleeping...
1525/3:I'll have to write this up.
1526/0:... just a show for the media.
1527/0:You know what to do.  // urgent
1528/0:Something's going on...
1528/1:Hey... is someone there?
1528/2:... won't catch ME sleeping...
1528/3:I'll have to report this.
1528/4:Might be a sign we need more guards patrolling here...
1528/5:The WTO doesn't take trespassing lightly...
1528/6:What's this all about?
1528/7:I'll find out soon enough.
1529/0:I think we might have company.
1530/0:I think we might have company.
1531/0:Here I come.
1531/1:Time to smoke you outta your hole.
1531/2:I'm feelin' lucky.
1531/3:Right around here somewhere...
1531/4:Not long now and I'll see what this is about.
1532/0:Here I come.
1532/1:Time to smoke you outta your hole.
1532/2:I'm feelin' lucky.
1532/3:Right around here somewhere...
1532/4:You're in trouble now.
1532/5:Is someone there...?
1532/6:Simple matter of trial and error...
1532/7:They always said I had good listening skills...
1532/8:I better make sure, I guess.
1533/0:What's the matter?  Scared?
1534/0:Sorry, I really don't have that many credits on me. [150]
1535/0:Her Holiness be damned!  I should have known it was a stupid idea.  Who am I?  I'm just a medina kid who got a lucky break.  This won't be the first time a respectable entrepreneur turned into a toothless beggar.
1536/0:Until our security assessment changes, Tarsus will be operating as a closed campus.  Please remain in the main complex.
1537/0:Citizens are reminded to stay clear of the Panzerwerks factory until the situation there has been resolved.
1538/0:
1539/0:Sure thing.
1540/0:I will notify the SSC.  They will want to investigate the apartment.
1541/0:I'll just be glad when we can make the drop for the Omar.
1542/0:When they lose a cyborg, the Omar replace it with the person they blame for the death.  It's called forced assimilation.
1543/0:Until your older brother, JC, broke up their network and in the process caused the world economic collapse.  When you were five, ApostleCorp moved you and your foster parents to Chicago.
1544/0:We've got the numbers...
1545/0:Anybody.  A lot of people don't like Omar.  Most people think they're freaks.  Right now, supposedly these Knights Templar fanatics are planning a raid.  So I'm waiting for them.
1546/0:The arcology eliminates wasteful consumption of land, energy and time by putting living, working and public spaces within easy reach of each other, making walking the main form of transportation.
1547/0:This one wants to run.
1548/0:Well done.  Enjoy.  Even though they run on normal energy cells, your systems are far more efficient than the standard Piezochem architecture.  Now get down to the street.  The elevator on this level uses the lab's general access code -- 3445.
1549/0:Try to pin him down.
1550/0:
1551/0:Try to pin her down.
1552/0:Strip and grid, let's go.
1552/1:We're closing in...
1552/2:Stay sharp.
1552/3:Rabbit's gonna jump.
1553/0:More details on the Chicago disaster -- As far as we know now, only one bomb was detonated, in a major downtown area, destroying everything within a wide, but as of yet undetermined radius.  
1554/0:Not a bad way to make a living, compared to what's out there.
1555/0:Shoot!
1555/1:Who the--!
1555/2:Aaaa!
1555/3:U-u-u-u-h...
1556/0:Strip and grid, let's go.
1556/1:We're closing in...
1556/2:Stay sharp.
1556/3:Rabbit's gonna jump.
1557/0:We keep our operations secret for a reason, Alex.  Don't expect a full debriefing while you're still in danger of being captured.  Now install your biomods and get out of there.
1558/0:No problem.
1558/1:Perfect.
1558/2:Hey!
1559/0:I'm not blind.
1559/1:That's right, duck and hide...
1560/0:Ready when you are.
1560/1:You better back off!
1561/0:I'm not blind.
1561/1:That's right, duck and hide...
1562/0:A threat from the arcology, but the Omar endure.
1563/0:I'm talkin' to you, buddy.
1564/0:Gonna take a closer look over here.
1565/0:Sure, you see a lot more mutants around, but they aren't a threat to humanity or anything.
1566/0:I'm talkin' to you, lady.
1567/0:Gonna take a closer look over here.
1568/0:I asked Mr. Dumier how I join something like special ops, and he just shrugged me off.
1569/0:Better go see what that noise was.
1569/1:Now I'm sure I heard something...
1570/0:Uh -- excuse me... This facility is for gold-team personnel only.  Stay right there while I check with security.
1571/0:Better go see what that noise was.
1571/1:Now I'm sure I heard something...
1572/0:Scans reveal an excellent foundation for biomodification.  You are only beginning.
1573/0:Investigating a sound.
1574/0:Investigating a sound.
1575/0:EMP grenades are useful, but I don't have the credits. [400]
1576/0:Hey, this is ME you're talking to.  "Scientific research should be based on an altruistic gift economy, not profit."  That's straight out of your master's thesis, Karl.
1577/0:The Templars have not said what they are going to do with us.
1578/0:QueeQueg's is all about the bean.  You can't have a good cup of coffee without a good bean.
1579/0:Or some psych experiment?
1580/0:I am studying akkolatt -- the mental factor for inebriation.
1581/0:Some sort of nanotech pollution.  Personally, I think it's population control.  I think the bots from the arcology spread the stuff.
1582/0:You don't strike me as the religious type.
1583/0:Every person on Earth will be merged, to one degree or another.
1584/0:
1585/0:No screwin' around now, or I'll have to take you out back and work you over with a crowbar.... (laugh)  Just kiddin'!  Have a good time.
1586/0:Oh my God...
1586/1:(scream)
1587/0:Contact!
1587/1:I have a target.
1588/0:Get him!
1588/1:I'll get him.
1589/0:Get her!
1589/1:I'll get her.
1590/0:So you think they're safe?
1591/0:
1592/0:That thing's out for blood!
1592/1:It's attacking me!
1593/0:Hey!
1593/1:Trouble!
1593/2:Responding...
1593/3:You're breaking at least three WTO regulations.
1593/4:I will enforce WTO law.
1594/0:Hold on -- I can't carry anything else right now.
1595/0:Greasel on the loose!
1596/0:Hey!
1596/1:Trouble!
1596/2:Responding...
1596/3:I'm onto you!
1596/4:You're in for it now!
1597/0:I'll handle the baby greasel.
1598/0:You there!
1599/0:Good work.  The area will be safe for travel shortly.  Now that the area is safe for travel, you may want to report the news to the Inclinator director.
1600/0:I've got to find someone to take on this job.  We're stuck until that nanoformer gets repaired.
1601/0:Watch out -- karkian!
1602/0:You there!
1603/0:What the hell's that?!
1604/0:Buddy, you're caught.
1605/0:Watch out -- sentinel!
1606/0:Buddy, you're caught.
1607/0:Lady, you're caught.
1608/0:Lady, you're caught.
1609/0:We've got company.
1610/0:We've got company.
1611/0:The Claw's gonna be hard-pressed to fill Gob-zilla's skin, but always bet on the trainer, I like to say.  How much?
1612/0:Oh, sure.  In the evening we're usually free to move about the city.  This building is at the edge of Upper Seattle.  You'll be amazed at what a nice enclave the WTO has built.
1613/0:Lordy, this place is for real.
1614/0:Yeah, I can find my way out, but -- hey -- look at me again.  I was right, wasn't I?  You're MODIFIED.  You're a stinkin' DEFILER!
1615/0:Tarsus continues to provide the best educational opportunities.
1616/0:
1617/0:It looks like they're getting things under control around here.
1618/0:I can't stand them.  So disfigured... They are the worst offenders against human Purity.
1619/0:You had your chance.
1620/0:People know not to try anything while the SSC is on watch.
1621/0:You!
1621/1:I'm authorized to shoot on sight!
1622/0:Die, dammit!
1623/0:Target still hot.
1623/1:This one's not goin' away.
1624/0:Hold on... no room.
1625/0:There he is!
1626/0:There she is!
1627/0:I've completed Phase I of the Omar induction.  They said I would have two months to decide whether to accept the cortical interface, which will make me a true Omar, but they are afraid the Templars will attack the medina.  They want me to undergo Phase II immediately.
1628/0:Draw your weapon, beggar.
1629/0:This is bioinformatics.  We aren't expecting any visitors.
1630/0:Business is always about the same... since you asked.  That's what I was saying.  You can barely make a profit up here because of the high rent.
1631/0:There's no way to predict what will happen now.
1632/0:
1633/0:I appreciate the concern, but I can think for myself.
1634/0:That's my assignment, but these cyborgs can fight when they have to.  I just wish we had a better tip -- like, when the raid's gonna happen.  Then maybe I could get some sleep.
1635/0:Flight bay's opening up!  I'm comin' in!
1636/0:Hey, I got a lot on my mind.
1637/0:Now you're startin' weird me out, dude.
1638/0:... in my sights.
1638/1:Easy, easy...
1638/2:This is gonna sting a little.
1639/0:My turn.
1640/0:This boy's about to get stitched.
1641/0:This girl's about to get stitched.
1642/0:Now you're startin' weird me out, girl.
1643/0:Thanks.
1644/0:I already talked to him.  I'm too important to his plan for him to kill me.
1645/0:What do you mean by "JC's habitat"?
1646/0:Stay true, young Pliable.  Now make sure that JC Denton has been killed, then step into his machine inside the Statue so that the ducts will be primed with your nanite-capsid architecture.  My scientists will do the rest.
1647/0:Full authorization.  There's the target.
1647/1:Attack -- yes, you!  Authorized.  Go!  Go!  Go!
1648/0:Train your sensors on that bot.
1649/0:I think we're done here.
1650/0:I can't imagine why you let them pollute you like you did.
1651/0:Excellent.  By the Sword and the Trowel and the honor of the Magister Templi, I pronounce you a Knight of the Rosy Cross.
1652/0:Did the attack on Tarsus seem harmless to you?  These people are crazy and they need to be dealt with.
1653/0:If you see any suspicious activity, please report it to the SSC office immediately.
1654/0:Good work -- you found Dr. Nassif's place.  Now see what you can learn.
1655/0:He's safe now.  My former classmate, Billie Adams, was plotting to destroy him, but she's no longer an issue.
1656/0:After the results of the referendum were announced on this day last year, demonstrators took to the streets, to make their anger and disapproval known.  
1657/0:Better call in a bot.
1658/0:Give me a sec.
1659/0:Better get a medbot in here...
1660/0:Better call in a repair bot.
1661/0:
1662/0:Looks like a job for a drone.
1663/0:My fault.  Sorry...
1663/1:No!  That's not what I meant to do!
1664/0:The Order are nothing but thieves and terrorists.
1665/0:Time to retrench!
1665/1:No good!  No good!  Let's pull back.
1666/0:Get an angle!  Move!
1667/0:Surround him!
1668/0:I have work to do.
1669/0:Surround her!
1670/0:Let's try to get a little closer.
1670/1:Easy does it.  One step at a time.
1670/2:We gain ground one step at a time -- just like the handbook says.
1671/0:We will trust the Luminon's judgment.
1672/0:I guess you get to where you like whatever you're accustomed to.
1673/0:I am ready to fight on the front lines and if necessary be imprisoned for my faith.
1674/0:Just tell me who to bring down.
1675/0:That's a pretty serious accusation.  Do you have proof?
1676/0:I think you took a wrong turn somewhere.  
1677/0:The people attacking Tarsus -- are they the ones responsible for Chicago?  What's going on?
1678/0:I show up, and my manager isn't even here.  With my luck, she's dead and I'll have to wait around for a replacement.
1679/0:What happened to the city's security forces?
1680/0:Find the Aquinas specification, upload it to our scientists, then neutralize the Dentons and destroy their machine.  The world doesn't need any new gods.
1681/0:The pilot will be interrogated.  I shouldn't tell you more than that.
1682/0:No one better try anything on my watch.
1683/0:Move in!
1683/1:Attack!  Now!
1684/0:Go!  Go!  Go!  Before he can react!
1685/0:Go!  Go!  Go!  Before she can react!
1686/0:Command better beef up intelligence so that no one else gets caught like this.
1687/0:If SSC would have shut down the Order months ago, there would be no riot and we would not be living under lockdown now.
1688/0:Dance.
1688/1:... just missed...
1689/0:Do me a favor.  Try to understand what this confilct is about before you attack anybody else.
1690/0:I missed.
1690/1:Can't get a shot!
1691/0:Meet us in New York.  Help us replace the social mechanism with a social organism -- one that is self-aware and can consciously evolve.
1692/0:Someone get him!
1693/0:So you're serious -- leaving all your work at Tarsus behind so you can join this church.  How do you know we can trust THEM?  They attacked the apartments and put us in danger.
1694/0:I'm so glad Her Holiness was rescued.  Now the Summit can get back on track.
1695/0:Someone get her!
1696/0:SSC will get Trier back under control.  It's just going to take a little time.
1697/0:It knows when I'm gonna shoot!
1698/0:Tarsus Tracking Report 1242 -- Klara Sparks.  She is naive, but loyal.  She's allied herself with the WTO, who've placed her high in the ranks, owing to her abilities.  Intel suggests that Dumier has recognized her special attributes as well, and seems to be treating her as a special protege.  She was last seen in Trier, dispatched for security for the Order-WTO summit.
1699/0:The vent high on the wall leads to it, but there is a spiderbot keeping vermin out of the ventilation system.  Or you could go through that opening in the floor to the maintenance tunnels.  At the end, past the boilers, there is a ladder to the secret office.  There is some serious climbing and jumping, though, and only the girls in gymnastics have been able to do it.  The code to the room is 9133.
1700/0:Sorry...
1701/0:Thank you for the tip.  You're entitled to an informant's bonus, if you're interested.
1702/0:I can't reveal anything more.  Be informed, however, that when I locate my passenger, you will have to hire another pilot.
1703/0:One question, Chief -- Chicago.  Who programmed the nanite detonator, why didn't we know about it, what is the WTO going to do about it?
1704/0:Today only we're offering a special price.  Would you like to make a purchase?
1705/0:I had a run-in with some Templars in the apartment building across from the mosque.  They're history.  Maybe there won't be any raid.
1706/0:All right.  You get one chance.  But next time you're makin' a donation.  I want to get my sick mamma a present.
1707/0:First I need you to upload the Aquinas specification, then we will deal with the situation inside the Statue.
1708/0:These stories about Seekers stealing from the factory are just propaganda.
1709/0:Wait here.
1710/0:We lost WTO Security Chief Donna Morgan today, too.
1711/0:Okay, I'll mark where they are.  Just give me enough credits for a doctor's visit.  My mom's sick.  [200 credits.]
1712/0:What's going on?  I saw one of your troopers killed.
1713/0:I'll find you!
1713/1:Slipped away, I guess.
1714/0:Lost sight of the beggar...
1715/0:Don't look at ME.
1715/1:I lost the target.
1716/0:Kirkpatrick?  I've never --
1717/0:Where'd he go?  // to self
1718/0:I heard there was an accident....  Sorry to spoil your plans.
1719/0:Find him!
1719/1:No sign of him.
1720/0:Where'd she go?  // to self
1721/0:Find her!
1721/1:No sign of her.
1722/0:Where'd it go?  // panicked
1723/0:You won't get away!
1723/1:Get back here!
1724/0:Too late to say I'm sorry...
1725/0:Most of us are a little uneasy about the Templars.  I guess a company the size of Mako doesn't have much of a conscience.
1726/0:I will, sweetie.  Hey, thanks for being here for me.  I love this, and I love US.  But you know that I've got to get back.  I'll send word when I find an apartment.
1727/0:You want me to kill someone's greasel?
1728/0:A Templar-run facility in Flight Bay 24 on arcology Level 110 has a number of classified programs -- most importantly, a body-armor project for Templar Paladins.  Also, a counter-agent to the pollution that causes Plague 11 has been invented, though its deployment has been inexplicably delayed.
1729/0:My head is spinning.
1730/0:They said it was for someone who wanted his shipment and privacy protected.  Ha!  I never trust those late-night deliveries.
1731/0:Step over to one of the flight-bay windows.  Look at that wasteland.  Imagine if you were responsible for rebuilding an economic system to accommodate a planet full of beggars.  Not as simple as it might seem to people on the outside.
1732/0:How do I get in?
1733/0:Can never be too safe.
1734/0:I want to live and work honestly, as Her Holiness teaches we should.
1735/0:Seattle should have their WTO charter revoked for how poorly they're handling this.
1736/0:No loitering.
1737/0:JC sleeps.  Unsafe.
1738/0:Target pulling back.
1738/1:It's not over yet.
1739/0:I think it's hurt.
1740/0:Someone cut her off!
1741/0:Someone cut him off!
1742/0:Yes -- this is the Cairo branch of your old alma-mater, curiously geared toward younger children rather than covert security.  There might be some clues about ApostleCorp inside, but the doors won't open unless you have a Visitation Pass.  Start with the Nassif greenhouse and Dr. Nassif's crooked uncle, who runs it.
1743/0:Some kinda biomod...
1744/0:
1745/0:
1746/0:I know you're cloaked.
1747/0:This is an intellectual property matter.  It doesn't concern the Order.
1748/0:And Mako Ballistics is reporting that terrorists have infiltrated their Redmond facility and have stolen the plans for a weapon prototype.
1749/0:Oh my god!  A laser took it out in mid-air!
1750/0:He's got his own missile defense system...  // harried
1751/0:She's got her own missile defense system... // harried
1752/0:Gonna jump me or what?
1753/0:That looks like a skull gun...
1753/1:So you've got a hole in your head.  Want another one?
1754/0:The Summit meeting must be good for business.
1755/0:You can tell a champ by the way she listens.  Shutterbug heard, she acted, she carried through.
1756/0:Untested and volatile nanotechnology, bought and sold on the streets. 
1757/0:Close to what?
1758/0:My whole life... just something they outlined on a piece of paper.
1759/0:Convergence... convergence... peace.
1760/0:How will JC get there?
1761/0:She moves freely toward her goal.
1762/0:So ApostleCorp has some sort of home base in Cairo.  I guess we know where you're going to find your next target -- but first you must deal with the scientist in the weapons lab.
1763/0:Most of us DON'T reside inside the well-guarded walls of an enclave.  Most of us would be surprised to see a uniformed officer on our street, outside our business, on our way to the market.
1764/0:Thanks for the help.
1765/0:If you put it that way.  We don't want another Collapse.  What you can do for us is follow up on your discovery at the Minister of Culture's penthouse.  Check out the Mako lab north of town.  We know they've been doing illegal weapons research and that your former trainer, Dr. Nassif, has contacts there.  You'll need to hire a pilot and leave at once.
1766/0:Someone musta been sore I didn't join up, or they wouldn't have gassed the place with me asleep.
1767/0:I don't want to be bothered unless you have business to discuss.
1768/0:We are saving these children from further disintegration and impurity.
1769/0:Can the housing units be repaired?
1770/0:No....!  NO!  The Templars are destroying the Helios core!  Satisfied, Alex?  I'm mortal like you again.  Helios won't be able to save me this time, but I don't plan to be the one who needs saving.
1771/0:Talk to me.
1772/0:
1773/0:Now I can breathe a little easier.
1774/0:Reportedly, she will cautiously accept the summit invitation but will emphasize her belief that WTO policies are the root cause of the rioting, not Order evangelism.
1775/0:
1776/0:I activated a pilot beacon on the flight deck.
1777/0:You only have to pay once.
1778/0:I am satisfied.  Nothing remains that can challenge Grand Master Dumier.
1779/0:
1780/0:You are troubled or untrustworthy.  Sometimes destroy, sometimes save.
1781/0:No use riskin' my bird until you're ready to move out.
1782/0:Why does everyone seem so edgy around here?
1783/0:What for?
1784/0:Yes.  I'm trying to get access to this hangar to see if it might explain these figures...and failing miserably.  Whoever said the WTO has perfected bureaucracy has obviously never dealt with the Templars.
1785/0:It's me.
1786/0:Pequod's.  Coffee for your kind of world.
1787/0:That should fit most firearms.  Good luck.  Be careful of our turrets and alarms -- the terrorists have reprogrammed them.
1788/0:Are you sure?
1789/0:There's the generator.  Simply bring it on-line, and the pilot beacon will begin receiving power.
1790/0:I haven't yet done anything to earn his confidence.
1791/0:Sid Black.  Harrier pilot.  Best flyer in the Western Hemisphere.  I drop my birds on the curb.  Spread it around.  I've got a contract lined up after the summit, but I'm still available for local hops.
1792/0:Can't afford anyone in Upper Seattle?  Don't expect to get a better deal just because you're in a scabby part of town.
1793/0:I'm showing another entry for Alex D in the crime database.
1794/0:Just a small security matter.  I've had trouble finding reliable protection.  You see, one of my VIP club members is being framed by a lawyer living in the Emerald Suites.
1795/0:I prefer friendly ones, sweets, but I guess I'll take what I can get.  I'll meet you outside the tavern.
1796/0:I guess someone put you on our trail.  It didn't take them long to get to you, did it?
1797/0:Don't DO this, Alex!  
1798/0:Some people think they've got to get in a fight or vandalize or steal in order to have a good time.
1799/0:Who sent YOU?  You look modified.
1800/0:That haptic interface is MINE.  
1801/0:Something else that might work -- just blow the whole thing up with a grenade.
1802/0:Maybe another time.
1803/0:
1804/0:Clearly we were all very wrong about you, Alex.
1805/0:Your way is clear.  You may go.
1806/0:And...?
1807/0:I'm not worried about a little bit of body-armor.  The Templars are a cult.  They don't have the training to stand up to a WTO division.
1808/0:You're outnumbered, bro'.
1809/0:The Trader will be happy to discuss possible transactions with you.
1810/0:You're outnumbered, babe.
1811/0:I don't run things anymore.  Talk to the Director.
1812/0:My associate will answer your questions.
1813/0:See ya.
1813/1:That's right.  I'm a truck.  You're a gob puppy on a highway...
1814/0:He was gonna take me with him this time...
1815/0:Sorry yet?
1816/0:See?  Back each other up and we win.
1817/0:Finish the scab -- do I have to do EVERYTHING?
1818/0:Sport?
1819/0:You drink only the finest, most authentic coffee, because you demand excellence in everything you do.  
1820/0:(grunt)
1820/1:(grunt)
1821/0:Alex, if you're trying to get to Lower Seattle, you're stuck.  There's been a toxic spill at the Inclinator -- the only way to travel there.  The hazard flush system or a nanoformer bot could clean up the mess, but the maintenance team is blocked from using either.  Maybe you could help out?  For more details, talk to the facility director in her office.
1822/0:Your turn, scab!
1822/1:Oh my god...
1823/0:I'm as ignorant as you. I did see the paladins remove a cryogenically frozen body -- maybe that was the facility director, maybe a botched experiment.  Who knows? 
1824/0:You killed him!
1825/0:
1825/1:
1826/0:You killed her!
1827/0:Probably some sort of office politics, someone trying to get back at somebody else.
1828/0:If they would only open their eyes...
1829/0:An associate of mine.
1830/0:Excellent.  My technicians on Ophelia are already configuring the first operational Aquinas Hub in a generation... one which is in orbit and safe from tampering.  Now destroy that absurd contraption JC Denton left inside the Statue.  Never can be too careful...
1831/0:Now I just need to find Sid and go, right?
1832/0:It's too bad it had to end that way.
1833/0:
1834/0:Put me down for Shutterbug.
1835/0:Why me?  Are you sure you've got the right person?
1836/0:Liberty Island is critical for JC Denton's plan -- we'll find out more when we get there.
1837/0:Huh?  // startled
1837/1:Hm.
1837/2:Uh-oh.
1838/0:Scab better make a move or fade out.
1838/1:Could be somethin', I guess.
1838/2:Somethin' ain't right.
1839/0:I don't like it...
1840/0:I'm a corporal, and I'm sending you to guard the ramp.
1841/0:... saw SOMETHIN'...
1842/0:You know the deal.  For a reasonable sum of money, it's just like you have the pass.
1843/0:Scab's for real -- be careful.
1844/0:Brother's down...
1845/0:Sis went down...
1846/0:You did the right thing, my seeker.  Once a destroyer like Dr. Nassif believes she is improving humanity, nothing can save her.  Come.  Hire a pilot at Pequod's coffee shop on Level 107 and help us pick up the trail in Germany.
1847/0:NO!  Stinkin' gob...
1848/0:It's gonna eat him!
1849/0:It's gonna eat her!
1850/0:Good.  Now follow through.
1851/0:Nice.  Done like a pro...
1852/0:Good.  Soften him up.
1853/0:Good.  Soften her up.
1854/0:Without Mina?  Oh, I don't know if I could.  I hope you killed whoever it was that got her.
1855/0:Don't worry -- you're good for the rest of the day.
1856/0:Not exactly.  Who wants to know?
1857/0:Speak with Chief Morgan or get lost.  We don't have time for this.
1858/0:There's no reasoning with you, but there's no need to fight either.  Do what you have to.
1859/0:Patience.  All of us, Dr. Nassif included, were once trainees like you.
1860/0:Don't forget about New Cairo.
1861/0:Cool.
1862/0:Real smooth.  Think I'm deaf?
1863/0:Then you go down the path of intolerance, as your friend Billie did.  Is human nature perfect?  No.  Therefore, improvements are to be welcomed, not annihilated in Templar pogroms.  As enhanced beings, we can establish a pure democracy that runs on instantaneous input from the electorate.
1864/0:Now what?
1864/1:This better not keep up...
1864/2:I knew it was SOMETHIN'...
1865/0:Guess I was wrong.
1865/1:Just wishful thinking.
1866/0:I appreciate your candor, Luminon.  Now if you'll excuse me...
1867/0:Forget it.
1868/0:
1869/0:Oh well.  Thought I saw something.
1870/0:The latest in our ongoing coverage of the missing persons reports at the Tarsus Academy in New Cairo.  
1871/0:Hearin' things.  Dead aerostats must be clogging up my ears...
1872/0:Won't give me the slip next time...
1872/1:Huh.  Got away.
1873/0:Just tryin' to scrip' a livin' any way I can.
1874/0:If you can sneak past the camera, or take it out with EMP, you'll be fine.  As soon as that camera catches sight of a target, the turret opens fire.
1875/0:Looked like an enclave type.
1876/0:At this point I'd take you up on it, too.
1877/0:The brief claims that the Arcology Chairman suppressed research that could have cured the plague, and that you can testify accordingly.
1878/0:Offbrand must be lost... heh-heh.
1879/0:It's an uneasy partnership.  I know that they'll dump me as soon as I'm not needed.
1880/0:Brother knows what's good for him.
1881/0:Tag, my friend -- are you with the Summit?
1882/0:I never trusted Luminon Saman... yet his rhetoric appeals to a number of our more brash Seekers.
1883/0:Forget that.  How do you know they won't just cut us loose, given all this trouble at their facilities?  Grab what you can NOW -- get your biomods installed -- Tarsus owes us that much.  I got mine and they're worth the trouble.  
1884/0:(laughs) LOOK at the scab...
1884/1:Your kill.  You ditch the body.
1885/0:You got him.  Groovy.
1886/0:Deputized and immunized for a scabland sweep.  One hour, tops.
1887/0:You got her.  Groovy.
1888/0:
1889/0:You all right?
1889/1:Musta hurt.  That's what happens when you try to show off.
1890/0:Watch it -- scab can fight.
1891/0:Where YOU goin'?
1891/1:Yeah, you're hurtin'.  Better head out.
1891/2:I'm right behind you, once I put this scab on the ground.
1892/0:Do somethin'!
1892/1:I need help!!!
1893/0:You are contaminating my research!
1894/0:I guess I should think of something else to talk about.
1895/0:Wait for me.
1896/0:Get in this, man!
1897/0:You certainly know how to make an entrance.  What's with shooting up the SSC Station like this?
1898/0:Get in this, girl!
1899/0:All an investor needs is a little faith.
1900/0:
1901/0:I already put down the money for Sid Black, the Harrier pilot.
1902/0:I know what I want to do now.
1903/0:
1904/0:The Scriptures, though...  Were they --
1905/0:Chick knows what's good for her.
1906/0:Be ready next time.  Somethin's gettin' scrip'ed.
1907/0:I've got to prepare for NG's arrival.
1908/0:
1909/0:You worthless feeb, you let him get away!
1910/0:You worthless feeb, you let her get away!
1911/0:I know you're just software.  Probably have holocoms all over the world...
1912/0:Thanks, I'll take the Frag Rounds Mod.
1913/0:Find the Aquinas specification, transmit it to my team in Munich, then neutralize JC Denton and step into his machine.  My scientists will modify your nanite architecture into a delivery vehicle for our cellular defense mechanism.
1914/0:Not worth stickin' my neck out for, I guess.
1914/1:Been a while since I went through a bad business like that.
1915/0:Next time the scab shows up?  Gonna be takeback, one way or another.
1916/0:At least I'm still breathin'.
1916/1:Scab's gonna pay for that.
1917/0:Scab's dead.  Soon as I get the chance.
1917/1:Killer's gone.  Man.
1918/0:Pretty low, stealin' from us.  Huh.  // gives up
1918/1:Thief's gone.  Nothin' I can do about it.
1919/0:Huh.  Weird.  Better check this out.
1919/1:Hey, somebody lost...?
1919/2:Ain't no one run's a drag on ME...
1920/0:I wouldn't mind paying more if I knew the money was going to the workers or to sustainable coffee plantations.
1921/0:Faithful soldier, our objective is to recover the Aquinas Protocol specification from a computer on the lower level of UNATCO.  JC Denton's machine taps into the old Aquinas network.  Creating our own hub would let us use JC's machine for the opposite of its intended purpose.
1922/0:
1923/0:The concept of arcology was developed by Paolo Soleri in early modern pre-Collapse society, during the 1960s.  Simply put, it is the fusion of architecture with ecology.
1924/0:I'll call the bank in the morning.
1925/0:The Order is with you.  Go.  You're free.
1926/0:The chances of you finding a bug in a globally distributed AI construct are ten billion to one.
1927/0:Breaking news:  The city of Chicago is under attack.  We've only just received the first reports, so little is clear at this point.  
1928/0:I could party all night.
1929/0:Representative democracy was sluggish and prone to corruption, the result of the technological limitations of previous centuries.
1930/0:For your information, I actually like lemon-lime.
1931/0:This is an historic moment that the SSC is proud to be a part of.  To demonstrate our commitment to making this a safe and productive meeting, I am flying to Trier myself to ensure that everything goes according to plan.
1932/0:If you ask me, I think they oughta make a clean sweep of the city.  Order fanatics oughta be shot on sight.
1933/0:I guess I just wasn't smart enough.
1934/0:You might be on to something there.
1935/0:We better move on this.
1936/0:Where you hidin', feeb?
1936/1:Don't think I won't stand up to this!
1936/2:Must be gettin' close...
1937/0:We've gotta be right on top of this scab.
1937/1:Don't think we won't stand up to this!
1938/0:A black-market biomod would be great, if I could afford it.  [500]
1939/0:Suddenly so shy... Come on, give me another look...
1940/0:Look at him struttin' round the pit, showin' off just like his Daddy...
1941/0:Think I saw something.  Gonna go get a better look.
1942/0:Yeah.  How about cutting me in for some of that reward money.
1943/0:I'm listenin'...
1944/0:Hey!
1944/1:Looks like I got a situation.
1944/2:Got a line on this one!
1945/0:Hey, you!
1945/1:You just stepped in it -- big time.
1945/2:Wh-Who's that?  // worried
1946/0:First the school, then this!
1947/0:Come on!  Let's go, mister.  // threatening
1948/0:Come on!  Let's go, hon.  // threatening
1949/0:My biomods don't change who I am.  They're tools -- I use them to complete certain tasks.
1950/0:I think it's a done deal.  Sorry.  I probably shouldn't say any more since the papers haven't been signed.
1951/0:Stop hanging around -- time for action.
1952/0:
1952/1:
1953/0:You're confident you can deploy your biomod weapon worldwide?
1954/0:The old order is generally recognized as the high point of civilization.  We simply want to revive it.
1955/0:I looked around the school.  Your daughter had a close call, but she's fine.  The new headmaster was working for the Templars -- some sort of plot to murder the most talented students and their families.  I killed him.
1956/0:Show your face, feeb!
1956/1:Someone's about to get juiced.
1957/0:We gotta stop runnin' around like a bunch of feebs... Do somethin'!
1958/0:Trust me, three is never a crowd... Now chop-chop.  Here is the key to the back stairwell of my penthouse.  Stay in the kitchen until I arrive, or the bot will take offense.  I live at the Emerald Suites.  You can get to the hotel's lobby from the upper sidewalk.
1959/0:Let's move on him!
1960/0:She's gobmeat.
1961/0:How do you expect me to steal a biomod?  Kill him and bring you the body?
1962/0:Next one's the World Championship.  Betting starts ten minutes before the fight.
1963/0:Jeez!
1963/1:(scream)
1964/0:What IS this place anyway?
1965/0:(growl)
1965/1:I ain't afraid to get mean.
1966/0:That's great. If you can take care of this, I'll pay well.  If you manage to take care of it, report back to me, so I know it's safe to reactivate operations.  Until then, no one's going to be able to get down to Lower Seattle. 
1967/0:Oh yeah, feeb?
1968/0:Oh, big man!
1969/0:Don't nobody mess with ME, girl.
1970/0:More gob population-control.
1971/0:You will be pleased with the selection.
1972/0:Whatever its shortcomings, the Church has at least brought stability to a large part of the world.
1973/0:Not that I don't trust you -- but I'm staying right here.
1974/0:Comin'.
1974/1:You got it.
1974/2:... don't have to tell ME...
1975/0:(laugh)  Just kiddin', babe.
1976/0:(clears throat) ... somethin' in the air...
1976/1:Uh-huh.  That's right.
1976/2:... always leavin' me the feeb jobs...
1976/3:At least I got a roof over my head.
1976/4:Got ripped off again...
1976/5:I got a reputation to uphold.
1976/6:I wasn't born yesterday.
1976/7:Gotta start stackin' my chits so I can get my OWN situation...
1976/8:I don't care what they say -- I work for myself...
1977/0:Another archaic analogy?
1978/0:... gonna die in this place...
1979/0:... gonna die out here...
1980/0:We may have our doubts but JC thinks you will truly help us all, so we will wait and watch.
1981/0:(cough)
1981/1:(laugh)  // to self, not sinister
1981/2:(clear throat)
1981/3:(hum)  // mimic guitar riffs, Classic Rock
1982/0:Hey, two's a crowd.
1982/1:Watch where you're goin'.
1982/2:Ow!  Are you drunk or what?
1982/3:Get off me.
1982/4:Hey!  Got a problem?
1983/0:This job doesn't pay all that good, but you see all kinds of people.
1984/0:I enjoyed our chat.
1985/0:The Plan has been carried out.
1986/0:Your systems have no place in the Age of Light, Denton.
1987/0:All mine.
1987/1:Let's get the gob-eatin' punk!
1988/0:Gob!  Twelve o'clock!
1989/0:Denying people their natural-born rights to choose their own artificially-flavored destinies.  Like I said, there's just something wrong with that machine.
1990/0:... gettin' sick of you hangin' around...
1990/1:See?  Try and ditch out, but I'm right here waitin'.
1991/0:Thought you was shook.
1992/0:Thought you was ghost, man.
1993/0:Thought you was ghost, hon.
1994/0:Chairman Dumier has informed me of your crime.
1995/0:Thought I ran this thing off.
1996/0:Not over yet...  // calling to buddy
1997/0:Yo, he's back!
1998/0:Run her off this time!
1999/0:I will remain in my craft.
2000/0:You should already know that Miss Klara Sparks' death was a blow to us.  We are now depending on YOU, Alex.  Only a Denton or one of the trainees can use the Gate.
2001/0:Back off, man.
2002/0:Just get some rest for now.  I'm glad I could help.
2003/0:Back off, sis'.
2004/0:(grunt) I'm one of you!
2004/1:(grunt) Real smooth, spaz.
2005/0:What?!  // exasperated
2005/1:Quit lookin' at me.
2005/2:You ain't no beauty queen, either.
2005/3:Somethin' wrong?
2005/4:See somethin' you like?
2006/0:Patience.  All of us, Dr. Nassif included, were once trainees like you.
2007/0:You're gonna get yourself in trouble.
2007/1:Hey, I saw that.
2007/2:I wouldn't do that if I was you...
2007/3:Real cute.
2007/4:That's right -- you bad.  Pfff!
2008/0:Beat it.
2008/1:Stop, turn around, and walk away.  Got it?
2009/0:Wrong way, man.  You better head back.
2010/0:Wrong way, sis'.  You better head back.
2011/0:Am I gettin' mugged or what?
2011/1:Yo, put that away.
2012/0:Oh.  Well, that explains it, then.  I have a couple of drinks here every night, and every night I go home to an empty penthouse.
2013/0:You got balls, bro'.
2014/0:Dr. Ramachandran, please dial 512.
2015/0:Sounds exciting.
2016/0:You better not be someone else trying to get into Flight Bay 24.  I've had it up to here with that today.
2017/0:I am beginning to doubt that anything is as it seems here.
2018/0:You sure are a curious young woman.
2019/0:Nice.  Done like a pro...
2020/0:(laugh) Think the boy's gonna cry...
2021/0:
2022/0:(laugh) Think the girl's gonna cry...
2023/0:Now that JC is awake, he will put things right.
2024/0:(chuckle) Right on.  Look at the scab.
2024/1:You got lucky.
2025/0:No gun?  Stupid way to get yourself juiced.
2026/0:You gotta split whatever's in his pockets.
2027/0:I guess you're not very political.
2028/0:You gotta split whatever's in her pockets.
2029/0:Don't just stand there out in the open...
2030/0:Any new news?  In the meantime, I've come up with something that might help you out.  I found it tucked away in a corner of the hangar.
2031/0:I don't know why they haven't sent in one of our own security teams.
2032/0:Watch it -- scab can fight.
2033/0:He's on you!
2034/0:... put a cap in your scabby butt...
2034/1:Quick -- duck!
2035/0:She's on you!
2036/0:It wouldn't be wise for me to discuss it.  Let's go.
2037/0:Watch me pop this scab wide open.
2038/0:You got problem, girl?
2039/0:Okay, that's enough.
2040/0:Don't push it, dude.
2041/0:Don't push it, girl.
2042/0:I didn't bust into the enclave to meet people.
2043/0:Hey!  This is my space.  My space.
2043/1:Better quit pushin'.  I mean it.
2043/2:Don't be messin' with me, understand?
2043/3:Think you're big enough to push me around?
2044/0:(grunt) Now you're makin' me mad.
2044/1:(grunt) Jesus -- you hit me!
2045/0:Now you're startin' to freak me out.
2045/1:You messin' with me?  Is that it?
2045/2:I'm not scareda you.
2045/3:Fine.  Stare all you want.  I couild care less.
2046/0:I talked to Miss Withers.  She said that she already has her mind made up on a Pequod's endorsement.
2047/0:You better cut that out.
2047/1:I'm warnin' you...
2047/2:That's enough.  Yep -- I'm talkin' to YOU.
2047/3:Dumbass.
2048/0:Read my lips: goodbye.
2048/1:I'm tellin' you to leave.
2049/0:Hol' up.  Serious, bro', you gotta take off.
2050/0:Depends on the odds and the game.
2051/0:How's that for first-class?  New Cairo arcology, Flight Bay 23... Eye of the Pyramid.  I even set you up with a pass for entering and leaving the arcology.
2052/0:I've had some contact with the Order, but I haven't heard about any legal actions.
2053/0:You monster!  How could you do this?  To your own family?!  After all ApostleCorp has given you, this is your thanks?  Get away from me.
2054/0:I'd like to know what it does.  That woman, Adams.  I think she knows.  She got all queer when I asked about it.
2055/0:You seem to think you've succeeded.
2056/0:Retribution is inevitable.  Retribution against Club Vox.
2057/0:You leavin' me?!  Hey!  // panic
2057/1:Bustin' out, huh?  Chicken.
2057/2:Save your own ass -- see if I care.
2058/0:
2059/0:Help!
2059/1:Someone get in this!
2059/2:Come ON!  Back me up!
2060/0:Here you are -- our biggest secret -- walking straight into a deployment of Templars.  Surely you've guessed -- You're the next generation of the technology MJ-12 used to create JC Denton.  You are the third Denton prototype, a clone of JC.    
2061/0:Somebody get this guy!
2062/0:Somebody get this chick!
2063/0:Hey, bot.  Target the scab -- there!
2064/0:Time to bring the armor...
2065/0:
2066/0:That med bot better get here quick.
2067/0:Sure could use a repair bot.
2068/0:Many organizations would like to see us fail.  That's perhaps all I should say for now.
2069/0:Time to add a drone to the scenario...
2070/0:No good.  Get out...
2070/1:Too hot.  See ya later...
2070/2:Forget it.
2071/0:Get the sides...
2071/1:What'd'ya think you're doin'?  Spread out!
2071/2:Cut the scab off!
2072/0:I heard it's just one strain, a genetic experiment.  Company was called VersaLife.
2073/0:Not too fast.
2073/1:On MY lead.  Move when I move.
2073/2:Careful.  This is for real.
2074/0:I don't know why they haven't sent in one of our own security teams.
2075/0:Don't make me go in alone...
2075/1:Now!
2076/0:Quick!  He can't stop us if we go in together...
2077/0:The toxic spill the facility director told you about is just another way that the WTO  is reaping the benefits of its harmful and polluting industries.  The area's been closed off and they've deployed bots to patrol and secure it.  May Her Holiness watch over you as you try to navigate these obstacles.
2078/0:This research facility was abandoned by VersaLife nearly two decades ago.  You will need to power up its pilot beacon with a generator on the lower level of the B Wing before you will be able to leave Antarctica.
2079/0:Hol' up.  Serious, hon, you gotta take off.
2080/0:Give me the energy cells. [600]
2081/0:I'm presumin' this threat to be serious.  Just lettin' you know.
2081/1:You better not set me off.
2082/0:I've just about had it.
2082/1:Keep it up, yeah...  Go on.  Keep it up.
2083/0:That's it!  Gonna make me have to hurt you.
2083/1:Keep actin' like a feeb, I'ma bust you up like a feeb.  Dump you in the gutter.
2084/0:(growl) ... pushin' his luck...
2085/0:My shop's closed right now.  Not a lot of late-night drinkers in this part of town.
2086/0:(growl) ... pushin' her luck...
2087/0:So you think you're a comedian.  I don't see anybody laughin'.
2088/0:That freaked me out, man.
2089/0:I heard you activated the beacon.  Thanks.  
2090/0:That freaked me out, sis'.
2091/0:Not now!
2091/1:Just let me take care of this!
2092/0:Good, you found the facility.  Transmit the specification to the WTO orbiting science platform, Ophelia.  We will do the rest.
2093/0:Great place, huh?
2094/0:I know you've joined our cause, but you're still one of them on the inside.  We can shake hands AFTER you've undergone purification.
2095/0:Sure, the terrorists can get the upper hand in Chicago and Seattle, but nothing like that could ever happen here.
2096/0:The Others here, you are not like them.  You can see the true path.
2097/0:You may pass.
2098/0:What "procedure?"
2099/0:Now what about the compensation.
2100/0:Quick!  She can't stop us if we go in together...
2101/0:Attention trainees -- self-study will last only until the top of the hour.
2102/0:I am trying to get ahead in Calculus.  I want to make it into whatever new elite program Tarsus has just started.
2103/0:You must be in town for the summit.
2104/0:I'm worried about the terrorists.  I hope they can't get into the arcology.
2105/0:Here goes...
2106/0:Grenade!
2107/0:I guess the Luminon was right.
2108/0:Tricky...  Better watch my step.
2109/0:That's right: get small and get gone.
2109/1:You can't be far...
2110/0:You should take the biomod canister before it is purchased by another customer.
2111/0:Guess he feebed out...
2112/0:Are you going to pay his debt or bring me his head?
2113/0:No problem.
2114/0:Guess she feebed out...
2115/0:Get ready.  Could be anywhere.
2116/0:I've seen him around.
2117/0:Please carry on with your business.
2118/0:Oops.
2118/1:What -- think I did it on purpose?
2119/0:Damn thing won't open!
2120/0:Chairman Dumier is watching me very closely.  I'd better stay behind.  Besides, I still believe in the WTO -- just not its leader.
2121/0:Let me think about it.
2122/0:I'll find a way through...
2122/1:Hm.  Something in the way.
2123/0:(grunt)
2123/1:(grunt) Here I come...
2124/0:Nuh-uh.  I'm stayin' right here.
2124/1:I'm not STUPID.  
2125/0:The rich drone on about opportunity -- the poor fill their pockets with little scraps of propaganda. "Inmost Order."  "Balance."  "Cheeta Cheeta Cheeta."  What a farce!
2126/0:... gettin' help!
2126/1:Those feebs must be deaf.  Be right back.
2127/0:Later.
2127/1:I'm ghost.  See ya.
2127/2:Gotta back down...
2127/3:That's it!  I ain't STUPID...
2128/0:Wait.  What was THAT?
2129/0:We've decided to adopt, Nicolette and I.  We're going to adopt the population of the entire planet.
2130/0:The Templars have commissioned a new grade of firearm from Mako -- the Mag Rail.  The Order very much opposes the creation of any new weapons.  Your other objective will be to locate the scientist in charge and kill him.
2131/0:
2132/0:Probably staged -- a test for the new transfers.  They rewrote the exercises because of my performance.  If there was trouble, they'd notify me immediately.
2133/0:Yeah?  I must be dead, then.  I'm up to my eyeballs in biomods.
2134/0:Ability.  Ability is the ideal that drives the modern state.  It's a synonym for one's worth, one's social reach, one's "election," in the Biblical sense, and it's the ideal that needs to be changed if people are to begin living as equals.
2135/0:Talk.
2135/1:Just tell me where and get out of the way.
2136/0:Things are a little crazy around here, but luckily it's no Chicago.
2137/0:This has always been your destiny.  It is good that a Denton has finally accepted it.
2138/0:Her Holiness had a lovely vision for society.  It pains me to see it soiled by politics.
2139/0:We'll find the scab.
2140/0:That's right.  Stick around here, and you're cooked.
2141/0:We have good reason to believe that ApostleCorp's headquarters are in Cairo.  This is where she would go looking for help.  Hey, I almost forgot.  Here's something Chen wanted me to give you as a bonus for killing that Mako guy.
2142/0:Didn't mean to scare ya off...
2143/0:The scab's tryin' to get away!
2144/0:Comin'.
2144/1:Cool.  Right behind you.
2144/2:I'm on it.
2145/0:I give up.  You don't have a clue what to believe in, do you?  One extreme and then another.  When I kill you, what will you have died for?
2146/0:The gob's gettin' away!
2147/0:Sure thing, bro'.
2148/0:Chick don't like us.
2149/0:Sure thing, girl.
2150/0:My daughter is always sick.
2151/0:Dude don't like us.
2152/0:Whoa!
2152/1:Missed me...
2153/0:No, man.  You gotta do it steady.  Like this.
2154/0:Another thrill-packed afternoon, huh?
2155/0:No, hon.  You gotta do it steady.  Like this.
2156/0:Your problem's solved.
2157/0:
2158/0:
2159/0:You're one of them.  I can tell from your eyes.
2160/0:The Omar appreciate your business.
2161/0:You can't blame him for trying, I guess.
2162/0:I was trying to get some sleep on the platform, and then there's this toxic cloud.
2163/0:The information he's collecting seems suspicious.  I do not think that it's legal for him to be sending that outside the school, either.
2164/0:See, we all think we're independent and make up our own minds, but we're really just a mishmash of everything that gets thrown at us.
2165/0:I hope none of my deliveries are delayed.
2166/0:Oh no.  I'm sorry I really don't--
2167/0:I have to live under curfew because a bunch of treehuggers will not leave the bot factory alone.
2168/0:Maybe your grand-pappy was a punk.  But I bet you never fought a low-down low-town scab like me.
2169/0:... you KNOW it...
2169/1:Uh-huh.  That's right.
2169/2:... always givin' me hell...
2169/3:I can hack it... 
2169/4:'Bout time I started thinkin' about havin' kids...
2169/5:Gotta get up on that scrip'...
2169/6:I got my mind made up this time...
2169/7:The feeb probably deserved it.
2169/8:I'll break the scab's arms...
2169/9:Stupid way to lose a tooth...
2169/10:That's what I get for giving him a loan, I guess.
2170/0:They gonna leave me in here forever?
2171/0:They gonna leave me out here forever?
2172/0:(yawn)
2172/1:(grumble)
2172/2:(cough)
2172/3:(whistle Pequod's music)
2173/0:Keep your grubby mitts to yourself.
2173/1:Hey.  You're in the way.
2173/2:Real smooth, scab.
2174/0:Jerk.
2174/1:Watch it, man.
2175/0:What's the matter, lady?
2175/1:Watch it, girl.
2176/0:(grunt) Hey, yo!  That hurt.
2177/0:Hey.  // greeting
2177/1:I'm gettin' tired of lookin' at you.
2177/2:No worries.  I ain't gonna try nothin'.
2177/3:I guess you aren't the shy type.
2178/0:Of course.  It's a simple repair.  I just seem to have left Trier without any multitools.
2179/0:
2180/0:Are you nuts?
2180/1:Hey, I saw that.
2180/2:Hey, yo, nuh-uh.
2181/0:Please listen with the rest of the Faithful.
2182/0:Well, well.  An enclave kid come down to cruise the slums on Daddy's credit line.  First time at sea level?
2183/0:Her Holiness had a lovely vision for society.  It pains me to see it soiled by politics.
2184/0:I wanna see some guts.  Come on!
2185/0:Miss Withers, huh?  I'll let you know if I run into her.
2186/0:You already joined -- at the kiosk on Level 107, remember?  (laughs)
2187/0:She always was a prankster.
2188/0:
2189/0:Seriously?
2190/0:Yes, you demand authenticity from everything you do, and coffee is no exception.
2191/0:Hold it.  Access restricted, know what I'm sayin'?
2192/0:Wrong way, man.  You better turn back.
2193/0:Wrong way, sis'.  You better turn back.
2194/0:
2195/0:I hear ya.  Gotta be packin' somethin' around here...
2195/1:You lookin' for a fight?
2196/0:Time to cool it.  Know what I'm sayin'?
2197/0:We don't make the rules.  We just enforce them.
2198/0:Easy on that scrip', bro'.  I got an eye on you.
2199/0:By transferring your biomod architecture to JC, you will complete his interface to the AI and bring him out of the coma.  This is a job we intended for Paul, but now it falls on your shoulders.
2200/0:Easy on that scrip', girl.  I got an eye on you
2201/0:Hey, yo, you tryin' to start somethin'?
2201/1:Shove me, I'ma shove you.  I mean it.
2201/2:I didn't appreciate that.
2201/3:Careful.  I'm contagious.
2201/4:Show some respect, will ya?
2202/0:(grunt) You tryin' to provoke?  Huh?
2202/1:(grunt) CAREFUL!  JEEZ!
2203/0:This is SSC headquarters for Trier.  
2204/0:Quit starin'.
2204/1:Don't need an audience, know what I'm sayin'?
2204/2:Go stare at someone else.
2204/3:Wipe that smile off your face.
2205/0:I can't wait to see his priceless art collection.
2206/0:My friend, thanks to you and the NG Resonance endorsement I am in line for a Regional Directorship.  Your effort was not wasted.
2207/0:Sitting down to talk with our enemies -- and what?  Bow to their demands?  I cannot believe the Order is participating in this summit.
2208/0:I want to finish off Paul Denton.
2209/0:I found out that the missing Tarsus children were just playing a prank.
2210/0:Not this time.  They found a cure and reprogrammed the bots.
2211/0:
2211/1:
2211/2:
2212/0:This is a private facility.
2213/0:I think this is just an old storeroom they tried to fix up.
2214/0:I'm afraid that in Trier even the most faithful are less than pleased by the appearance of their spiritual leader partnering with the WTO.
2215/0:Sounds easy enough.  Do you want to follow me through?
2216/0:Good to hear that the envoy from Antarctica has arrived.  It hasn't been determined how much of a link any of them have with him while he's asleep like this, but it can't hurt to continue the research.
2217/0:
2217/1:
2218/0:
2219/0:The Templars have overrun all of New Cairo, including the mosque.  They have moved Paul Denton's cryo-storage tank to Flight Bay 24 on Level 110 of the arcology.
2220/0:
2221/0:Bad idea.  Know what I'm sayin'?
2221/1:Jackass.
2221/2:Seriously, that ain't gonna play.
2221/3:(laugh) Are you nuts or what?
2222/0:
2223/0:That ain't gonna scrip' with me, bro'.
2224/0:That ain't gonna scrip' with me, sis'.
2225/0:
2226/0:Leave.  Now.
2227/0:You mean it, huh?  Is that what's gettin' scrip'ed?
2227/1:You better not set me off.
2228/0:You know what you've been asked to do.
2229/0:I've just about had it.
2229/1:Think I'm soft, huh?  Think I got words and don't have deeds?
2230/0:I'm serious, man.  Better stand down.
2231/0:I'm serious, sis'.  Better stand down.
2232/0:(disgusted laugh) Thinks I'm afraid to fight...
2232/1:Punk.  You think I'm just talkin' hard?
2233/0:I'll kill you, man.  I'll KILL you.
2234/0:You turned out to have some guts after all.
2235/0:
2236/0:It seems that the Illuminati is making one last grab for power.  You must revive Paul, Alex.  ApostleCorp needs a strong leader who can restore it to global prominence.  The Illuminati want only to steal our research to increase their wealth and power.
2237/0:Sorry.
2238/0:Oh no.  I'm sorry I really don't--
2239/0:I make it a point to scope out the rookies.  They're too young to have fight-records, so a lot of times the odds are all out of whack.
2240/0:Tarsus Tracking Report 4117 -- Alex D.  There are concerns that D. may be the greatest threat among her peers.  Last seen in Cairo, questioning Leila Nassif for the WTO.   Intel suggests that she now has objectives in Trier.  This makes it imperative that we get our agent through the gate immediately and shut it down.
2241/0:Take the elevator to the ground level.  You and the others will be on your own in Seattle.  Just keep your heads down and I will contact you when Tarsus can arrange an extraction.
2242/0:Just let him go, Red.
2243/0:He cleans cleaner bots?
2244/0:Work with us, Alex.  If you show me I can trust you, I am prepared to privelege you like the son I never had.
2245/0:Certainly.  Well done.
2246/0:You ready to go?  You'll be scanned at the exit.  It'll unlock everything.
2247/0:It's true that SSC's performance so far has been less than adequate.
2248/0:Sorry, I don't work there.  You said it's a factory?  In the canal?  What else do you know about it?
2249/0:They're all frothy and swirly.
2250/0:Just imagine how communication will change when every mind is linked together with lightspeed transmissions.
2251/0:Alex D.  The information you provided our agent has proven valuable.  He was successful against the invaders and would like to thank you.  Your future business with the Omar will proceed on much more favorable terms.
2252/0:
2253/0:Find the Aquinas specification, transmit it to my team in Munich, then neutralize the Dentons and step into their machine.  My scientists will modify your nanite architecture into a delivery vehicle for our cellular defense mechanism.
2254/0:I'll kill you, sis'.  I'll KILL you.
2255/0:No more feebin' out on me.  Cool?
2256/0:Hold on!
2256/1:Can't talk.  Gotta keep my head in the game.
2257/0:Oh, hell... just shoot me now.
2257/1:It's not my fault!
2258/0:Damn, it won't open!
2259/0:It won't be easy to get into the VIP lounge -- the elevator is keycoded.  You'll have to be resourceful.
2260/0:I can't get through!
2260/1:Huh?  I'm think I'm stuck.
2261/0:You work in a lab or something?
2262/0:(grunt)
2262/1:(grunt) Lemme try THIS...
2263/0:Ain't goin' THAT way...
2264/0:We need another gun!  Be right back!
2264/1:Goin' to find everybody...
2265/0:I knew pinching all this stuff would pay off.
2266/0:After all the time and money we put into your training, you could at least have protected my scientists.  The Order terrorists just took them out.
2267/0:No more transactions possible -- inventory depleted.
2268/0:To find a monster, you've got to be a monster, apparently.  We were too pure to track him down, but she sniffed him out immediately.
2269/0:
2270/0:Unclear.  Perhaps you would be interested in investigating.  The Omar can provide access to the air terminal in exchange for accepting a mercenary assignment.
2271/0:As for Green Dragon, she's the real thing.  Sewer-born, rat-fed... a hunter, you know.  I'd put my money on Green Dragon.
2272/0:You're not a thug.  Be sensible about this.
2273/0:So -- which will it be?
2274/0:Do NOT touch me.
2275/0:Both of us are targets here.  We will work separately until the final phase of the operation.
2276/0:U-u-u-uh!  // panic
2276/1:Sorry, I'm ghost.  Gotta look after my own, know what I mean?
2276/2:Gotta feeb out.  Sorry.
2276/3:I'm cooked!
2276/4:Pfff!  This is suicide...
2276/5:Just be cool.  I give up!
2277/0:Good luck, miss.
2278/0:Sorry I let you down, man!
2279/0:Sorry I let you down, sis'!
2280/0:I have no idea, but whatever it is, my figures suggest they're not paying nearly enough for transporting it via a WTO facility...  Maybe you'd have better luck?  A new face?  If you get the info to us, we can make it worth your while.  [200 credits]
2281/0:Whoa-whoa-whoa -- stop.  Don't think we're alone, know what I mean?
2281/1:Shhhh.  Could be some offbrand listenin' in.
2282/0:I wanna know where, I wanna know now.
2282/1:Talk.
2283/0:I am the only world leader who would use this Network AGAINST machine evolution.  Please -- nothing but obsolescence awaits humanity if we go back to microsecond economics.  Revive Aquinas and assign Hub privileges to our computing center in Munich.
2284/0:See someone come through here?
2285/0:Hey!  This is a secure area.
2286/0:I'll kill him!  Where'd he go?
2287/0:Hey!  This is a secure area.
2288/0:Hey, lady.  I just heard from Eddie downstairs.  He can stall a little while longer if you need more time to... you know.
2289/0:I'll kill her!  Where'd she go?
2290/0:Help me out here.
2291/0:Section 104... evading the police!
2291/1:You're not getting away that easy.
2291/2:Just gimme a target.... I need a target!
2292/0:See anybody?
2293/0:Section 104... evading the police!
2293/1:You're not getting away that easy.
2293/2:Just gimme a target.... I need a target!
2293/3:Don't mess with me!
2293/4:I think you're caught.  Just TRY and get away...
2293/5:Get out here NOW!
2293/6:You're going to be sorry you got up today!
2293/7:Go ahead and hide -- I'll get you anyway!
2294/0:Come on!  Let's work together!
2295/0:Come on!  Let's work together!
2296/0:Time to get this beggar.
2297/0:Time to get this beggar.
2298/0:I'm not laughing, mister.
2299/0:I'm not laughing, mister.
2300/0:Gotta get my ekaggat in tune for the match.  That's what the Order Church calls concentration.
2301/0:Come on.  We gotta get moving.
2302/0:I'm doing okay, for now.  The Templars are right at our door, but at least they're giving us a breather.  I just hope the rescue flight gets here before the next volley starts.
2303/0:New York, one way, no sweat.
2304/0:What do you want?  My life story?
2305/0:I'm not going anywhere near that lab.
2306/0:We've been with the program since we were thirteen years old.  Why are you so quick to abandon that?  What can the Order offer you?
2307/0:Now we don't have a defending champ.  Business'll probably fall off until we can get some legitimacy for a new one.
2308/0:You see where this is going.  The Minister should be out this time of night, living it up at Club Vox.
2309/0:Activating the Inclinator doesn't solve any of our problems right now.
2310/0:
2311/0:My buddy Carlos said he got a job to hold up the Metro operator.  I'm startin' to think he was tellin' the truth.
2312/0:I caught some scab sneakin' around.  Where'd he go?
2313/0:I caught some scab sneakin' around.  Where'd she go?
2314/0:Okay, I'll get out without being seen.
2315/0:Huh.  You notice anything?
2315/1:That ain't right -- know what I'm sayin'?
2316/0:There's no good reason for them to lock us in the facility like this.
2317/0:Hey, you see what that was?
2318/0:I could use a pilot.  I'll think about it.
2319/0:Yo, someone's here!  See the scab?
2320/0:I think I heard somebody.  What do you think?
2321/0:I'm not laughing, lady.
2322/0:Tell Eddie I need more time.
2323/0:It must've gotten lost in transit.  There's no record here.  Or perhaps you did not fill them out completely?  As soon as they have your forms in order, they'll be happy to permit your investigation.  Until then, there's nothing I can do. 
2324/0:Wake up.  Just saw a shadow.  With me?
2325/0:I just work the desk.
2326/0:Hey, wasn't that door closed?
2327/0:I'm not laughing, lady.
2328/0:Hey, wasn't that door open?
2329/0:You can't outrun ME!
2330/0:Man.  Someone's on a mission.  Know anything about this?
2331/0:You can't outrun ME!
2332/0:SSC will get Trier back under control.  It's just going to take a little time.
2333/0:Stay close.
2334/0:Stay close.
2335/0:We'll get him!
2336/0:Then you go down the path of intolerance, as your friend Billie did.  Is human nature perfect?  No.  Therefore, improvements are to be welcomed, not annihilated in Templar pogroms.  As enhanced beings, we can establish a pure democracy that runs on instantaneous input from the electorate.
2337/0:We'll get him!
2338/0:Saman understands that the human body is no machine.
2339/0:Stand by us, Alex.
2340/0:We'll get her!
2341/0:We'll get her!
2342/0:Our condolences to the families and friends of all those lost in the Chicago incident.
2343/0:Queequeg's Coffee.  True to the letter means it tastes even better.
2344/0:The Templars have the arcology locked down and have removed the pilot beacon so we can't even call for an airlift out of here.  
2345/0:I guess you pulled it off.
2346/0:You have my appreciation.
2347/0:An excellent exchange.
2348/0:These scabs had their chance.
2349/0:Warning:  Project Serpentine labs have been breached.
2350/0:Thanks again for your help.  The chopper should be along soon.
2351/0:Good work.  Our pilots should pick up the signal and be here in no time.
2352/0:Those Order freaks should just shut up and get real jobs.
2353/0:What about the VIP area?  What goes on back there?
2354/0:You weren't on the platform when that stuff spilled.  I don't even want to guess what it does to a person long-term.
2355/0:What the--!
2355/1:Uh-oh!
2355/2:Aaaa!
2355/3:U-u-u-u-h...
2356/0:The AI was created by MJ-12 to track every electronic transmission on the planet.
2357/0:I've seen him around.
2358/0:What the--!
2358/1:Uh-oh!
2358/2:Aaaa!
2358/3:U-u-u-u-h...
2359/0:
2359/1:
2360/0:Ha!
2360/1:Hey!
2360/2:All right, then.
2360/3:I can handle this.
2360/4:You're in for it now.
2360/5:Right outta the handbook.
2360/6:Piece of cake.
2360/7:Don't you see this uniform?
2361/0:Ha!
2361/1:Hey!
2361/2:All right, then.
2361/3:I can handle this.
2361/4:I'm an officer of the WTO and you're nothing.
2361/5:You shouldn't be starting this.
2361/6:You've bitten off more than you can chew.
2361/7:NOW you're in trouble!
2361/8:You're mine!  
2361/9:Hah!  NOW whatcha gonna do?
2361/10:There you are!
2362/0:You're gonna have to come through me.
2362/1:I'm armed!
2363/0:To date, the Church's leader has hidden behind a cloak of secrecy, appearing to her followers only as Her Holiness.  Furthermore, Fundamentalists such as Luminon Saman, champion a much stricter interpretation of Order doctrine.
2364/0:You're gonna have to come through me.
2364/1:I'm armed!
2364/2:I've got you now!
2364/3:Check -- and -- mate!
2364/4:Get ready -- you're about to become another statistic.
2365/0:It's over, man.
2366/0:It's over, man.
2367/0:It's over, lady.
2368/0:It's over, lady.
2369/0:Just taking a look around.
2370/0:What's the latest gossip?
2371/0:
2372/0:Can't take a hint, huh?
2373/0:That's a pretty scabby part of town -- mostly abandoned factories.  The Order renovated the cathedral, but, man... a lot of ways to end up dead in the Rauchstadt.
2374/0:Exactly.  JC will tell you more.  Please -- don't delay.  Every passing minute brings your friend, Billie, one step closer to murdering the only sincere leader humanity has ever had.
2375/0:Doesn't matter if you dress spiffy.  I don't fly scabs who can't pay the fare.
2376/0:How'd you end up in there?
2377/0:Yeah?
2378/0:
2379/0:
2380/0:Yeah, clean as a matador.... The Green Lady likes to take her time...
2381/0:
2382/0:Got the beggar right where I want...
2383/0:Jesus!
2383/1:Get!
2384/0:Unbelievable -- the Chairman himself is a Templar.  Maybe you should locate the files he was talking about and confront him in the hangar bay.
2385/0:I can't afford the ammo clips. [600]
2386/0:Jesus!
2386/1:Get!
2387/0:Should be a textbook hostile...
2387/1:Time to light up.
2388/0:Should be a textbook hostile...
2388/1:Time to light up.
2389/0:This guy's goin' down.
2390/0:This guy's goin' down.
2391/0:It was unwise to trust the safety of Her Holiness to WTO security.
2392/0:This chick's goin' down.
2393/0:Understood.  I'll be ready.
2394/0:This chick's goin' down.
2395/0:Get it!
2395/1:Whoa!  Watch out!
2396/0:No one saw a thing.  I think the kidnapping was an inside job.
2397/0:Get it!
2397/1:Whoa!  Watch out!
2398/0:I provide defense, should the need arise.  Traders handle the business.
2399/0:We just need to accelerate our progress.  Checking out the greenhouse is definitely the way to go.
2400/0:YES -- I'm upset.  Leave me alone.
2401/0:I'm still confused about why we were created.  Maybe you'll find out something in Antarctica.
2402/0:After this, I doubt I'll be trusting SSC with my life again.
2403/0:You'd better be ready.  After everything she's done to undermine the Grand Master's plans, he definitely wants this chick taken down.
2404/0:
2405/0:We were momentary allies against a common enemy -- not much more than that.  Then he became this -- this THING that freezes oceans and wants to drag every man, woman, and child into God only knows what kind of wasted world.  I don't think of him as JC, as a person who can be betrayed.  He is a force of Nature, an element to be overcome.
2406/0:
2407/0:If you want to hurt him, you're gonna have to go through me.
2408/0:
2409/0:Our colony is strengthened in number from your rescue.
2410/0:Your destiny awaits.
2411/0:
2412/0:No additional items for sale.
2413/0:I love to talk politics.
2414/0:I'm just a bouncer.
2415/0:Something like that.
2416/0:Back for more?
2416/1:I'll finish you off this time.
2416/2:Good to see you again.
2416/3:Now I can put a happy ending in my report.
2416/4:You just don't know when to quit.
2416/5:I tried to let you get away.
2416/6:You don't know when to quit.
2417/0:Now I have to think of a way to break the news to our family.
2418/0:Back for more?
2418/1:I tried to let you get away.
2418/2:Regulations -- I've got to finish you off now.
2418/3:You never learn do you?
2418/4:You won't escape this time.
2418/5:Can't resist the uniform, can you?
2418/6:Came back for more, just like in the handbook.
2418/7:Next round...
2418/8:Stuck around for more, huh?
2418/9:Now I'm going to finish this.
2419/0:Not so fast.
2419/1:Sneaky little beggar...
2420/0:Not so fast.
2420/1:Sneaky little beggar...
2421/0:Scat!  Scat!
2422/0:Scat!  Scat!
2423/0:No problem.  Just let me run to the ATM first.
2424/0:Let's have a take-down this time.
2424/1:There!
2425/0:Let's have a take-down this time.
2425/1:There!
2426/0:I ain't takin' a bullet for no private.
2427/0:He's back!
2428/0:Such as...?
2429/0:He's back!
2430/0:A pretty cryptic comment.
2431/0:Looks pretty rough down there.  Pity you couldn't afford a couple of my Sunfire missiles to help you out.  For what it's worth, here's a map of the island.  Later, sweets.  Think I'm gonna rag it over to Times Square to see Erin.
2432/0:The body must be dead, or we won't be certain of our enemy's fate.
2433/0:Come back when you have some news.
2434/0:The key I have is to the back stairwell.  It should get you into the kitchen via the storeroom.
2435/0:Dr. Patton, please report to the ballistics lab.
2436/0:I've got you covered.
2437/0:Yes -- of course.  Here you are.  Find the Sequencing Module.  Go through the gateway to JC's sanctuary.  We have our own interest in protecting JC Denton from the Templars.
2438/0:Just happy to be able to make myself useful, earn an honest credit, heh heh.
2439/0:Her Holiness is really Nicolette DuClare, the descendent of a large crime family.  This is a generated image used to brainwash seekers like yourself.
2440/0:Maybe it's safe again.
2441/0:So instead you "neutralize" the children yourself, rather than let them be polluted?
2442/0:She's back!
2443/0:We can live in peace, or provoke them into exterminating us.  A simple choice.
2444/0:She's back!
2445/0:I have done my best to explain this summit to them.  Frankly, it seems unlikely even to me that the Church followers will ever countenance the closed, monolithic communities of the WTO, but I suppose that's a matter for the wise discretion of Her Holiness.
2446/0:Guess I caught you off-guard.
2447/0:Guess I caught you off-guard.
2448/0:Maybe you could even our odds?  If the bot out there was destroyed, we might be able to make a run for Old Cairo.  It seems like the Templars do not care too much about us, but the bot is programmed to kill anyone who is not a member of their ranks.
2449/0:Exchange aborted.
2450/0:Yeah, as soon as the execs start talking money, I go right to sleep.
2451/0:Check the whole place.
2451/1:Keep looking - we're not done yet.
2451/2:Keep at it.  No one gets away.
2452/0:Thank you.  That buys my studio another month of life.
2453/0:No one chooses to live here.
2454/0:We'll find him.  How far could he go?
2454/1:Did you get a good look at him?
2455/0:I'm a businessman.  I know how to make tough decisions.
2456/0:Don't let her get behind you.
2456/1:Which way was she moving?
2457/0:He was crushed, of course.  I got written up for ineffective attention to duty.
2458/0:You have no idea what the consequences would be if you were captured.
2459/0:Come on.  250 creds.  That's chump change for a pilot like me.
2460/0:Plague 11 is history.  Now people are running TO the medina.
2461/0:Oh yeah?  Oh yeah?  Move.
2462/0:Wow -- that's speed!
2463/0:I'll check back when I need a pilot.
2464/0:We'll take it from here.
2465/0:Probably some sort of sensor disruption....
2466/0:So they centralize wealth with the WTO and ideology with the Order.  What about power?
2467/0:Yeah, baby, move on over...
2468/0:Got him.  Who needs mods?
2469/0:Hands off.  I'm not your type.
2470/0:Thanks.
2471/0:A pretty face and a pretty voice.  It's funny, but they're worth more than the entire population of the slums outside the arcology walls.
2472/0:Got her.  Who needs mods?
2473/0:Ooo, yeah.  Shake it.
2474/0:Nice.
2474/1:Got a bead on ya, beggar.
2475/0:Help me defend the human body, Alex.  It's our last refuge from the conspiracy of materials known as technology -- and from the all-too-human greed that gives it life.
2476/0:Off, man.
2477/0:Nice.
2477/1:Got a bead on ya, beggar.
2478/0:Hey, buddy, catch.
2479/0:Hey, buddy, catch.
2480/0:Hey, lady, catch.
2481/0:Hey, lady, catch.
2482/0:You found the pilot beacon.  Activate it, and I'll be able to land.
2483/0:I've got a shot!
2484/0:I've got a shot!
2485/0:Alex D. of Tarsus Academy.  You are alive.
2486/0:What's this all about?
2487/0:I'll go in close with the shotgun.
2488/0:Still... vandalism's a crime, right?
2489/0:Which one is it?
2490/0:I'm always right here, whenever you want to chat.
2491/0:Certainly the WTO, as well as the Order --
2492/0:Feels good, doesn't it?  Now what?
2493/0:I love this music, but the scene isn't all that great.
2494/0:With this act, the geography of human thinking will be leveled.  Every mind will be part of a continuum.
2495/0:I changed my mind.
2496/0:Mmm, what do I see?  An exceptional young woman.  Modified, correct?  Lovingly grown in an enclave -- and now you step into the dangerous world.
2497/0:Ha-ha!   Brother only thinks he's hard, I KNOW hard.
2498/0:I have him in my sights!
2499/0:Ha-ha!   Girl only thinks she's hard, I KNOW hard.
2500/0:I have him in my sights!
2501/0:I'll take the silencer. [300]
2502/0:Your turn, sucka!
2502/1:Kill one of us, I'ma kill one of you!
2503/0:I have her in my sights!
2504/0:
2505/0:They scrip' mine, I scrip' theirs.
2506/0:I have her in my sights!
2507/0:It...is...over...
2508/0:(wild laugh)  Thanks for the creds.  Think I'm gonna rag it over to Times Square to see Erin.  For what it's worth, here's a map of the island.  I figure you aren't leavin' that island, so why should I gamble my bird?  Right?  (laugh)  Over -- and -- out, baby...
2509/0:What's the matter -- chicken?
2509/1:Shouldn't start somethin' you can't finish...
2509/2:I'm comin' for ya, feeb.
2509/3:What IS this -- hide and seek?
2510/0:Some of my friends go to those meetings and say they're not militaristic at all.  It's all harmless mumbo-jumbo as far as I'm concerned.
2511/0:Away, AWAY!
2512/0:You don't sound worried.
2513/0:Engage.... Sendin' in the armor.  // first part to bot, second part to self
2514/0:Engage.... Sendin' in the armor.  // first part to bot, second part to self
2515/0:Let's hope he has a sense of humor.
2516/0:New combat priority -- that man.
2517/0:New combat priority -- that man.
2518/0:They're all good intentions...
2519/0:No more violence!  We are all friends of JC.
2520/0:Concert...?
2521/0:Only if preceded by an impure motivation.  However, since Saman's tactics were not working, Her Holiness came to Trier to try and reach some form of truce.  Now we have no idea where she is.
2522/0:Please enter ID.
2523/0:I'm reconsidering your offer.  Which keys and codes have you got?
2524/0:Very well.  We will be enemies.
2525/0:Do this for the Templars, then help us reconfigure JC's contraption to disburse a nanite-capsid predator, and we will end the plague of biomodification once and for all.
2526/0:I cannot watch over you anymore because I am needed elsewhere.  Here is a map of the island.  I hope that when the time comes you will choose to join us, Alex.
2527/0:Blessed be... Blessed be...
2528/0:My brave assassin, soon you will get to kill the other Denton brother and destroy his illegal machine, but first we must recover the Aquinas Protocol specification from a computer on the lower level of UNATCO.  Creating our own Aquinas hub would let us regulate the globe like the Grand Masters of the golden age.
2529/0:New combat priority -- that woman.
2530/0:New combat priority -- that woman.
2531/0:We still don't know what happened in Chicago, but we just got confirmation that subjects Billie and Alex were successfully evacuated to Seattle.  We'll try to maintain secrecy there, but it looks like our cover may be blown.
2532/0:Close one.  // relief
2532/1:Got lucky there...  // to self
2532/2:Erratic shooting.  First time in a firefight?
2533/0:Summoning a bot.
2533/1:Where the hell's the bot?  Better call it.
2534/0:Such a prize, mmmm...  A shame to send you straight to the chop shop.  Perhaps you heard that I'm hiring a mercenary...?
2535/0:That was close!
2535/1:I think I'm the target.
2535/2:This one couldn't hit the side of an adbot.
2536/0:Summoning a bot.
2536/1:Where the hell's the bot?  Better call it.
2537/0:Go away!  Now!
2538/0:Is he shooting at me or you?
2538/1:He's makin' mistakes!
2539/0:Better get a medbot in here...
2540/0:Not likely.  Tong always has an ulterior motive, at least where I am concerned.  You have my authority to attempt a rescue, but stay away from that old fool.  He will lure you into the criminal underworld.
2541/0:We're not letting ourselves get threatened into risking our lives.  You can't fire us for having some common sense.
2542/0:Is she shooting at me or you?
2542/1:She's makin' mistakes!
2543/0:Better get a medbot in here...
2544/0:Better get a repair bot on that and pronto.
2545/0:
2546/0:Better get a repair bot on that and pronto.
2547/0:I miss the ice and the others.
2548/0:Better let the drone handle it...
2549/0:Better let the drone handle it...
2550/0:So.  You fail to appreciate the situation.  Get your butt to the SSC station.  Now.
2551/0:Hurry up.  This could mean my job.
2552/0:Mr. Kirkpatrick also requests a good-faith payment, to help the operation recover.  [200 credits]
2553/0:Trouble?  TROUBLE?  Not at all -- unless you count canceling a major concert, getting trapped in a war zone, and practically starving to death without even a number to call for room service.
2554/0:Glad someone finally took care of it.
2555/0:I hope you enjoy your visit.
2556/0:(grunt) That's it!  // angry
2556/1:(grunt) It'll take more than that...
2557/0:(grunt) You got me...  // surprise
2557/1:(grunt) Your turn.
2558/0:
2559/0:(grunt) It's attacking me!
2560/0:(scream) Get it off me!
2561/0:(grunt) I'm hit!
2561/1:(grunt) ... taking some heat over here...
2562/0:Oh hell!  How'd THAT happen?
2562/1:I messed up.
2563/0:(grunt) He got me!
2564/0:Oh hell!  How'd THAT happen?
2564/1:I messed up.
2565/0:As you wish.  I'm looking for someone named Billie Adams.  I heard she's in this mosque.
2566/0:(grunt) She got me!
2567/0:Fall back!
2567/1:Retreat.  Let's move!
2568/0:I wandered off the tour.  So you're custom-designing weapons for this group calling itself the Templars?
2569/0:(grunt) Jesus, that hurt.
2569/1:Aagh!
2569/2:(grunt) ... not good...
2570/0:Fall back!
2570/1:Retreat.  Let's move!
2571/0:I don't feel good.
2572/0:(grunt) I'm injured!
2573/0:Let's spread out.
2574/0:No!  Get outta there!  Go!  Go!  Go!
2575/0:(groan)
2575/1:(groan) Oh, God...
2576/0:Let's spread out.
2577/0:You must strive with your meditations to become a pandita.  Our hindu brothers originated this goal, that of becoming one who is liberated or self-aware.  Through this inward reflection, you can liberate yourself from chaos and disorder.
2578/0:That's it -- hit him from all sides!
2579/0:That's it -- hit him from all sides!
2580/0:They're going to regret treating me like they have here.
2581/0:That's it -- hit her from all sides!
2582/0:That's it -- hit her from all sides!
2583/0:Welcome to Mako Ballistics.
2584/0:Yes, we will share with THEM the compassion and peace Her Holiness has shown US.
2585/0:It will be a book about rulers, you know.  Great personalities.
2586/0:
2586/1:
2586/2:
2587/0:It's okay, Chief Morgan, we can tell her the truth.
2588/0:I don't believe you.  I guess we'll just search your corpse.
2589/0:Don't sweat it.  They called the raid off.
2590/0:Thank you.  You may well have saved my life.
2591/0:Too bad you weren't in the field when all this trouble started.
2592/0:(groan) Don't do it!
2592/1:(groan) So you kill me.  Then what?
2593/0:(groan) Oh, God, it's gonna eat me!
2594/0:The renewed anti-WTO rioting in Germany has some world leaders issuing warnings about a possible civil war.
2595/0:JC must be awakened.  
2596/0:(groan) Backup!  Backup!  I need backup!
2597/0:That was weak.  // an insult
2597/1:(laugh) You gotta be kidding...  // incredulous
2597/2:Is this where I'm supposed to say 
2598/0:My friend, thanks to you and the NG Resonance endorsement I am in line for a Regional Directorship.  Your effort was not wasted.
2599/0:You want to hear more.  Good.  Let me explain how the Order should rebuild post-Collapse society.
2600/0:Aaaa!
2600/1:(grunt) That stings...
2601/0:All WTO personnel are required to adhere to the air terminal security policies.  Please refer to section 407.23 of your field manual.
2602/0:(scream)
2602/1:(scream)  Help!  I'm on fire!
2603/0:My eyes!
2603/1:I'm blinded!
2604/0:(moan)
2604/1:(moan)
2605/0:Hold on a sec -- I'm carrying too much.
2606/0:(moan) Stinkin' beggar...
2606/1:(moan) No!
2607/0:You betrayed me.  Why?
2608/0:(yelp)
2608/1:(sigh)  // dreamy exhalation as pass out
2609/0:Don't let a bunch of pseudoreligious mystics turn you into an assassin.  Locate Dr. Nassif and interrogate her.  The WTO wants to get to her before she reveals anything valuable to the Templar terrorists.  We think she may be holed up behind what remains of the ApostleCorp security system.
2610/0:Then why are you confiding this in me?
2611/0:Destruction -- that's easy.  But Her Holiness and Chairman Dumier think they can reunify the planet with a simple decree.
2612/0:You could be a part of it.  Your fellow student from Tarsus, Klara Sparks, has already accepted a position here.  Think about it.  
2613/0:
2614/0:
2615/0:You have proven to be a great ally, Alex.  JC looks forward to opening a new era in human history with you by his side.
2616/0:Nothing you can give me will help Paul now.  I've joined the Templar cause.  I let them draw my blood and transport him away.
2617/0:Club Vox is pleased to offer a safe environment for conducting business.
2618/0:What a day.  Maybe I should go home before it gets worse.  
2619/0:I figured you'd knock around Europe for a while.  You do know that the medina could get overrun by Templars at any moment...?
2620/0:(gasp)
2621/0:I'm ready!
2621/1:Bring it on, beggar.
2621/2:Time to bag this scum...
2622/0:Let's make it quick.
2622/1:Back me up.  I'll buy you a drink afterward.
2623/0:
2624/0:Oh boy...
2624/1:You probably think I'm scared.
2624/2:Can't reason with a maniac...
2625/0:This is what they pay us for.
2625/1:Get ready for the big time.
2626/0:For God's sake, how can you do this...?
2626/1:Don't hurt me!
2626/2:What do I do?!   // panic
2627/0:You fiend!  Without a test subject, my technicians can't verify our counter-nanite and will have to release it blind.  You may find yourself responsible for a plague like nothing the world has ever known.
2628/0:It's gonna be a massacre!  We've gotta do something!
2628/1:Just back each other up!  We can make it!
2628/2:Get ready!  We're next!
2629/0:We've gotta find a way to stop him!
2630/0:We've gotta find a way to stop her!
2631/0:Pit's downstairs.
2632/0:... got a piece of you...
2632/1:Gotcha.
2633/0:
2633/1:
2633/2:
2633/3:
2633/4:
2633/5:
2633/6:
2633/7:
2633/8:
2633/9:
2634/0:Shall we conduct business, or shall we wait until you examine the mutant?
2635/0:There are rumors about the Order -- that they are growing more extreme, like a cult.
2636/0:I think we should just rush them, but the captain won't give the order.
2637/0:I suppose you're entitled to your opinion.
2638/0:You have stopped her.
2639/0:The Elite Commando has been killed, but we still have you.  Remember what I said about Paul.  He and JC want to impose biomodification worldwide -- a nanite plague worse than the one in Cairo.  Help us keep the technology under control.
2640/0:It's hard to explain terrorism to a child.
2641/0:How's that feel, beggar?
2641/1:Better get your butt out of my sector.
2641/2:Had enough?
2642/0:Oh, well, you know.  They're all over.  You have to be really careful at night because they shoot at anything.
2643/0:Take that, tough guy.
2644/0:Take that, babe.
2645/0:Enemy wounded.
2645/1:I connected.
2645/2:Score.
2646/0:I got him.
2646/1:He's sprung a leak.
2647/0:Our Seekers are securing the building on foot, and we have reprogrammed your security systems to neutralize threats to our cause.
2648/0:I got her.
2648/1:She's sprung a leak.
2649/0:I got a piece of its hide.
2649/1:Help me kill it!
2650/0:Got you on the ropes...
2650/1:I can handle myself in close.
2650/2:Did that tickle?
2651/0:There.
2651/1:... a page right out of the handbook.
2651/2:That takes care of that.
2651/3:... haven't lost my touch.
2652/0:This is what the Illuminati wants you to do.  Destroy Paul Denton and help return biomod technology to international regulation.  Paul's frozen body is located in Flight Bay 24 on Level 110 of the arcology.  Don't be fooled into reviving that madman.  His destructive potential is second only to JC Denton's.
2653/0:Thank God -- it's dead.
2654/0:You can salvage nothing from that facility, because the conspriators are dead.  Hear me, Alex.  Go to the Statue and destroy the Denton machine.
2655/0:Of course I know about the Collapse.  If I fail to find the passenger I'm looking for, I'll be available to take you to another destination.  If so we'll leave from this landing pad.
2656/0:Snake-eyes all the way.
2657/0:Cairo.
2658/0:Nanologists and meteorologists continue to watch Nanite Swell 11 intently.  All indicators so far suggest that this is not a spurious short-term change but a radical climatological shift that scientists expect will severely weaken the effects of this swell, if not eliminate it entirely.  
2659/0:Not exactly -- some sort of decomposition process that will create a toxic vapor.
2660/0:I heard that the Omar put out a contract on him.
2661/0:Ever heard the name Alex D?  They told me the same thing.
2662/0:You ready to go?  You'll be scanned at the exit.  It'll unlock everything.
2663/0:I bet it's a coordinated attack.  They got the Inclinator and some sort of job training program.
2664/0:I notified the authorities.  SSC will take care of things.
2665/0:Guess what I found out?  The Order and WTO are both puppets of the Illuminati.
2666/0:If only you were right, but I think you make them too human in your imagination.  A cyborg doesn't get discouraged.
2667/0:Are you going to pay loverboy's fine or what?
2668/0:Shouldn't spit on a woman's uniform...
2669/0:Those little squirts are gonna take over the planet one day.
2670/0:... enough meat to feed a regiment.
2671/0:Cozying up to the WTO, eh?
2672/0:No doggy treat for you...
2673/0:Whew.  Glad that's over.
2673/1:Why these beggars and thieves risk their lives, I'll never know...
2674/0:I wonder what the WTO's gonna say.  Companies have to get their garbage out of Upper Seattle SOMEHOW.
2675/0:... thought he was hot stuff.
2676/0:Guess I gotta make do with the Claw.  He's got the experience, but he's no spring chicken anymore.
2677/0:Hmmm...
2677/1:Eh?
2677/2:What's that?
2678/0:That's twice you've sided with the Templars.  Guess you're a lost cause.  If I can't persuade you, I'll have to kill you.  See you shortly.
2679/0:Hmmm...
2679/1:Eh?
2679/2:What's that?
2680/0:Come again?
2681/0:I said I wanted it locked down.  Your team was supposed to be evacuated ten minutes ago.
2682/0:Come again?
2683/0:Welcome to Tarsus Cairo.  I am Silas Archer, the Headmaster.  Can I help you?
2684/0:
2685/0:You don't know how much this means to us.  It could save her life...  [5 credits]
2686/0:I think the world would be better off if people took the best things from both sides instead of always fighting over extremes.
2687/0:Then this conversation is at an end.
2688/0:They call it a "presence."  Looks like a plain old hologram to me.
2689/0:That's quite an extrapolation for a pop-star chatter-bot.
2690/0:Knowing my luck, the Templars will attack five minutes before the evacuation.
2691/0:I'm ready to pay well, if the pilot's worth it.
2692/0:An underground lab, on the outskirts of Trier...
2693/0:I need you to return to Cairo to rescue my brother, Paul, who was seized by the Templars.  Then meet me at Liberty Island, where in the ruins of an old military base there is an Aquinas node that can be used to distribute the infusion technology world-wide.
2694/0:We've survived other attacks.  We'll survive this one.
2695/0:Just a small security matter.  I've had trouble finding reliable protection.  You see, one of my VIP club members is being framed by a lawyer living in the Emerald Suites.
2696/0:Out of the corner of my eye...?
2697/0:Out of the corner of my eye...?
2698/0:Soon you will join the ranks of the Illuminati's select leaders.
2699/0:I wonder what's making that noise.
2700/0:I wonder what's making that noise.
2701/0:Again?  Hmmm...
2701/1:More of the same?
2701/2:There it goes again.
2702/0:Again?  Hmmm...
2702/1:More of the same?
2702/2:There it goes again.
2703/0:Something may be going on there. 
2703/1:That's strange...
2703/2:I can't really tell, but...
2704/0:I will wait as long as necessary.
2705/0:Liberty Island is critical for JC Denton's plan -- we'll find out more when we get there.
2706/0:Something may be going on there. 
2706/1:That's strange...
2706/2:I can't really tell, but...
2707/0:He's already out to get me because I handed his brother over to the Templars.
2708/0:I have a bad feeling about this.
2709/0:I have a bad feeling about this.
2710/0:We must all bide our time.
2711/0:This time -- you will see -- the ends justify the means.
2712/0:Sorry -- can't talk.  Boss is on the prowl.
2713/0:Rip 'em to shreds!
2714/0:I believe it, but the Grand Master will track down their other leaders and eliminate the organization completely.  I have faith in him.
2715/0:Everybody just wants an easy life.  Who can argue with that?
2716/0:I did some investigating.  Mr. Dumier thinks he can sacrifice Cairo in the short term, but he has sent his personal bodyguard, an elite commando, to kill an enemy of his being held in the arcology by the Templars.
2717/0:I left Hong Kong in 2052 with instructions to search for JC Denton near Groom Lake in Nevada.  I am an AI construct developed by Tracer Tong.  My instructions were not to stop looking until I was certain that Mr. Denton was safe.
2718/0:They may have won this battle, but we'll return better prepared and make them regret this.
2719/0:I think we're through here.
2720/0:Enough interruptions.
2721/0:JC is counting on you, Alex.
2722/0:I watched the vmail you sent to the Templars in Flight Bay 24.
2723/0:Oh no!
2723/1:This is serious.
2724/0:Oh no!
2724/1:This is serious.
2725/0:Security around here is falling apart.
2725/1:I'm going to settle this right now.
2726/0:How do you mean?
2727/0:Security around here is falling apart.
2727/1:I'm going to settle this right now.
2728/0:Hey!
2728/1:Oh no!
2728/2:Whoa!
2729/0:Ready for that biomod?
2730/0:I thought you said JC was powerful.
2731/0:Hey!
2731/1:Oh no!
2731/2:Whoa!
2732/0:I guess that's over with.
2732/1:Don't need to worry about that any more.
2733/0:You should've let me help you out.
2734/0:Do you know what's going on?  Dr. Nassif acted like nothing's wrong.
2735/0:What are you selling?
2736/0:I guess that's over with.
2736/1:Don't need to worry about that any more.
2737/0:Security must've caught whoever was poking around.
2738/0:Security must've caught whoever was poking around.
2739/0:Thank goodness Archer is where he can't hurt anyone.
2740/0:Good day, ma'am.
2741/0:It seems like ages since I was a student at Tarsus.  Oh, God, I was so naive!
2742/0:It's a plain fact.  The WTO has meant more jobs and more access to other WTO cities' industries.
2743/0:Good thinking.  Use the roof for sniping and moving about the area.
2744/0:Breather manufacturers have tried to keep this stuff under wraps.  They know it would cut into their sales.
2745/0:We have nothing further to discuss.
2746/0:I don't have the credits for the scrambler grenades. [600]
2747/0:Chairman Dumier of the WTO here.  So you found that old fool, Tracer Tong?  I would like to know what you were talking about.  Please report to the Trier SSC station.
2748/0:The terrorists reprogrammed our security, and that turret up there means business.  So we're trapped because the Order's out there, taking down scientists.
2749/0:
2750/0:They think they can hide their technology from the Harvester.  They are wrong.
2751/0:I'll think about settling his debt, but I don't have the money right now.  [250]
2752/0:We've been directed to let you pass.
2753/0:The clock's ticking, Alex.
2754/0:
2755/0:The transgenic tissue scan you recovered from the basement is already producing improvements in Omar survivability.
2756/0:Just confirming my departure.  No contact from Cairo yet.  I don't know what we'll do if headquarters gets hit as well.  More after I arrive in Egypt.
2757/0:The rioting is not going to solve anything. 
2758/0:You sir, you look like a discriminating person.  Someone who knows innovation when he sees it.
2759/0:Well, it's take-it-back or take-back, feeb.  Red ain't foolin'.  He's more scabland than a greasel pit-fighter.
2760/0:I think they're waiting for something.
2761/0:You aren't my assassin until I'm dead.
2762/0:
2763/0:
2764/0:No problem.  You all right?
2765/0:I already put down the money for Sid Black, the Harrier pilot.
2766/0:Thanks for getting to the bottom of this.  Everything's becoming clear to me now.
2767/0:Well, hello again...
2768/0:What do you think Saman's plans are for her in the long run?
2769/0:You aren't cleared to enter the landing bay, Alex.  Come back upstairs and report to my office at once.  My people are in the middle of a very important investigation.
2770/0:I hope we hear soon that the lockdown is lifted.
2771/0:
2771/1:
2771/2:
2771/3:
2772/0:Hm, and it looks like you've got your hands full already.  Maybe you could ask one of the guards for help?
2773/0:The train station's around the bend.  Just follow the upper sidewalk.
2774/0:I'm sorry, the Inclinator is closed until we can get this toxic spill cleaned up.
2775/0:The clock's ticking, Alex.
2776/0:I don't know you, so leave me alone.
2777/0:Sure you can stand up to crossfire from three directions?
2778/0:See someone come through here?
2779/0:Time again for a.... ta-a-alk BULLET!
2780/0:I'm lookin' for a guy.  A killer.  See anything?
2781/0:A lot of people look down their noses at home-bred gobs, but it's the training that counts, in my opinion.
2782/0:All right.  I'm ready.
2783/0:I'm lookin' for this chick.  A killer.  See anything?
2784/0:
2785/0:Which way?
2786/0:Of course, they don't tell ME anything.  They just needed a sharpshooter to verify the real-world usability.
2787/0:Can you help me out?  I'm following somebody.
2788/0:I caught some scab sneakin' around.  Where'd he go?
2789/0:It was a pleasure working together.
2790/0:Don't forget my bird has Sunfire missiles.  I can't do much against the arcology pyramid, but for a few more creds I might be able to help you out in New York.
2791/0:I caught some scab sneakin' around.  Where'd she go?
2792/0:Looks like Tina had to use the Claw instead of Gob-zilla.  Guess I owe you.
2793/0:
2794/0:What's this all about?
2794/1:Weird.  Somethin' about to go down?
2795/0:One thing I am is dependable.
2796/0:Did you see that?
2797/0:Hear that?
2798/0:Like hell he does.  He thinks I'm an old buffoon with no taste.  They all do.  It's the nature of youth and ambition.
2799/0:In other words, you want modified people to hold their value, like real estate.
2800/0:You saved our necks.  Now she can't fire us or force us to go in there.
2801/0:I was trying to get some sleep on the platform, and then there's this toxic cloud.
2802/0:Their intention to disguise tyranny with so-called "free" institutions.
2803/0:Our brethren made it to safety.
2804/0:Sandy.  Right, but a captain's gotta sail if he wants to keep his ship.
2805/0:Excellent.  My scientists on Ophelia will -- Wait!  Must be an overload... or a self-destruct sequence.  A blast door just sealed off the only exit.  You'll be trapped unless you can kill the power with the control box on the south wall -- or destroy the exposed conduits.  I wish we'd hired the technician who worked here to handle security in Trier.
2806/0:Yeah!  Gettin' hot!
2807/0:Military power will never vanish.  What we hope -- and Her Holiness once agreed with me -- is that a global police force would end territorial wars and be just that -- police, like the seekers in the medina.
2808/0:That was close!  Keep your eye on this scab...
2809/0:Is everyone in this joint out to kill Gob-zilla?
2810/0:Remember -- you are leasing from US.  You must grant the WTO entry for investigation of our own hangars.
2811/0:Heh -- this boy's all hiss and scratch.
2812/0:You're on your own now.
2813/0:Heh -- girl's all hiss and scratch.
2814/0:I'll take that chopper from downstairs -- if you don't mind.
2815/0:What the -- that ain't normal...
2815/1:How'd you do THAT?
2816/0:He's -- invisible!
2817/0:Time again for a... ta-a-alk BULLET!
2818/0:That bot means business.  When you start to feel the ground shake, it means it's nearby.
2819/0:She's -- invisible!
2820/0:Then of course I had to crash-land into Lake Washington.
2821/0:That's a gun!  In his forehead!
2822/0:That's a gun!  In her forehead!
2823/0:Thinks he's fast...
2824/0:Meanwhile, people on the outside go hungry.
2825/0:Did you see what caused that shadow?
2826/0:Hey, did someone close the door?
2827/0:Hey, did someone open the door?
2828/0:Just tell them you need time to think about it.
2829/0:Attention residents of Old Cairo.  The particle haze you are experiencing does not pose a health threat.
2830/0:What the hell happened to the door?  Any idea?
2831/0:Know who put that there?
2832/0:You drink only the finest, most authentic coffee, because you demand excellence in everything you do.  
2833/0:Use the keypad.  I'm just here to deal with the troublemakers.
2834/0:Know where it went?
2835/0:Real pretty.  Who messed with it?
2836/0:It's goin' haywire!  What's the deal?
2837/0:The SSC just stormed into the school and hauled the Headmaster away.
2838/0:It's down.  What's the deal?
2839/0:That's a serious detachment.
2840/0:It's all busted up.  Hey -- what's the deal?
2841/0:I'll take the multitools. [200]
2842/0:Good, you found the facility.  Transmit the specification to the WTO orbiting science platform, Ophelia.  We will do the rest.
2843/0:
2843/1:
2843/2:
2843/3:
2843/4:
2844/0:Don't play dumb.  I just got fired for taking a bribe.  How do you think THAT happened?
2845/0:They call it a "presence."  Looks like a plain old hologram to me.
2846/0:I don't take any satisfaction in killing.  He's done me a favor by dying prematurely.
2847/0:There is but one caged, but we are all together.
2848/0:SSC can have a chopper here pretty quickly.  We just can't get word to HQ without a pilot beacon.
2849/0:Thinks she's fast...
2850/0:(grunt)
2850/1:(grunt) Ain't nothin'...
2851/0:(grunt) Just a scratch.
2852/0:Just going for a walk.
2853/0:Aaeeiii!
2854/0:(grunt) It's gettin' ugly...
2855/0:A good kid.  Kind of a chip on his shoulder, though.  What about you?  Your eyes look a little bloodshot.  Been out in the dust?  You should've hired a better flyer.  Someone like me coulda dropped you in the city.
2856/0:(grunt) Brother's serious.
2857/0:No....!  NO!  The Illuminati are damaging the Helios core!  Satisfied, Alex?  I'm mortal like you again.  Helios won't be able to save me this time, but I don't plan to be the one who needs saving.
2858/0:(grunt) Chick's serious.
2859/0:(grunt) Get it off me!
2860/0:(grunt)
2860/1:(grunt) I felt that one.  // to self
2860/2:(groan) That one had some bite to it...
2861/0:(grunt) DO somethin'...
2862/0:I'm going to establish the first posthuman civilization, and you're my first citizen.  Welcome.
2863/0:Hey, are you one of the workers from that factory, under the canal?  My mom said to see if you need a message boy... We need the credits.
2864/0:Hey!  Did someone throw that?
2865/0:How'd that get turned on?
2866/0:In the wake of the Collapse, the WTO seized upon this highly integrated and compact urban form as a solution to the present toxicity and sprawl that were only exacerbated by the Collapse.  Not all WTO enclaves use this architecture, but in the environments that demand safe, sealed and tightly-knit cities have found success with this structure.
2867/0:How'd that get turned off?
2868/0:What's the deal?  Somebody just open this?
2869/0:Wanna do business?
2870/0:What's the deal?  Somebody just shut this?
2871/0:Which is why we had to do something.  The summit is useless.  We need to chase them out of Trier entirely.
2872/0:Who turned on the light?
2873/0:Who turned off the light?
2874/0:Where ya headed?
2875/0:What's the deal?  Think a person caused that?
2876/0:See the feeb who started the fire?
2877/0:Perhaps this is my destiny, to join the Illuminati in their endeavors.
2878/0:What's up with the smoke?
2879/0:Who sent YOU?  You look modified.
2880/0:I really must concentrate on my book now.
2881/0:We just want to get away from the Hateful Ones.
2882/0:I'm not worried about a little bit of body-armor.  The Templars are a cult.  They don't have the training to stand up to a WTO division.
2883/0:(groan)
2883/1:(groan) I'm cooked...
2884/0:
2885/0:(groan) I think I can hang on.
2886/0:I'm already carrying too much.
2887/0:Gettin' burned... some kind of poison...
2888/0:Sorry?  Who are you to be sorry?  You kill the parents, kill the plants -- yes, I see who comes and goes from the greenhouse -- and now you come to kill ME?  Well, the Nassif family is fighting back.  Leila escaped and you won't find her.
2889/0:(scream)
2890/0:My eyes...  // pained
2891/0:Was that s'posed to hurt?
2891/1:(laughs) Pretty weak...
2892/0:(grunt) 
2892/1:(scream) 
2893/0:(grunt) Got me...
2894/0:Thank you for saving me.
2895/0:(gasp)
2896/0:Oh yeah!
2896/1:Someone's gonna get juiced.
2897/0:Perhaps.  If you'd like free transportation, I'll be waiting at the landing pad outside the arcology.
2898/0:Until further notice, Mr. Dumier will conduct business only from behind a secure barrier.
2899/0:I can't wait to power up and show those modified freaks -- no offense -- the right way to enhance a soldier.
2900/0:Guess you're cracking out of luck, then.
2901/0:Know where the blood came from?
2902/0:You look like the man on the holocomm who warned Dr. Nassif about the security breach.
2903/0:Someone been fightin'?
2904/0:Wasn't me.  Try that way.
2904/1:Right over there.
2905/0:You might as well do what the Order wants -- you might turn up a lead.  The Nassifs run the greenhouse.
2906/0:Mighta seen something.  I don't know.  Try over there.
2907/0:The bookie's at the south door.
2908/0:Some enclave feeb.  Went thataway.
2909/0:I saw the guy.  That way.
2910/0:Your systems have no place in the Age of Light, Denton.
2911/0:I saw her.  She went that way.
2912/0:Haearin' somethin' weird over there.
2913/0:I can't wait to file this report.  
2914/0:Scab jumped me!  He went that way.
2915/0:Most WTO personnel believe in the original charter.  The organization as a whole can prevail against one man.
2916/0:You'd think someone would've seen this coming and warned us... maybe made a contingency plan....
2917/0:I guess you're one of the buyers.  You look like you're from a pretty hardcore outfit.  Must be a lot of undercover work.
2918/0:I want to take a look at the extent of the damage.  I might be able to help.
2919/0:I won't forget this, Alex.
2920/0:I want the ammo clip. [400]
2921/0:I'm gonna do this kind of thing when I grow up.  I'm gonna be a pro.
2922/0:The Hateful Ones are here, with others to destroy.  We must protect JC's plan.
2923/0:Not at all.  We are humankind's servants not their puppeteers.  We knew that human society could not respond to a single voice, so we engineered these organizations.  With these fronts, we can optimally lead civilization toward a bright future.
2924/0:Lots of bouncers in here.  Are they really necessary?
2925/0:I'm not kidding about an attack.  I saw a guard die in an explosion.
2926/0:We'll show them exactly what our "pollution" can do in the field.
2927/0:
2928/0:This don't scrip' with US.
2929/0:Hey, better watch the feebspeak around the Pit, or these scabs -- not me, of course -- but these other scabs might take advantage.  Know what I'm sayin'?
2930/0:I don't think Miss Withers is going to be taking bribes anytime soon.
2931/0:Think I'm scared?
2931/1:I got a bad feelin' about this.
2932/0:Hi.  I'm NG Resonance.  Welcome, Alex D.  Your last interaction was at Club Vox in Upper Seattle.  Why such a long journey?
2933/0:The scab's got guts.
2934/0:Maybe this will convince him to become one of my administrators.
2935/0:Stay in this!  // panic
2936/0:What do you mean?
2937/0:Gotta get through this...
2937/1:This is messed up.
2938/0:What'd I ever do to you?
2939/0:Easy, man.  I'm hurt already.
2940/0:Easy, lady.  I'm hurt already.
2941/0:What good are sociopolitical notions to a pilot drone?
2942/0:I don't know about this.
2942/1:Whatever.  If I die, I die.
2943/0:Don't run out on me, man.
2944/0:Get down there and scrip' some backup!
2945/0:I have to see your arcology pass before I can let you in.
2946/0:So I just keep working here, like nothing happened?
2947/0:Chick jumped me!  She went that way.
2948/0:Sorry.
2948/1:Don't go lookin' for trouble.
2949/0:Good work, Tarsus lady.  Here's your compensation.  I wonder what lucky corporations get to hire the Tarsus grads.
2950/0:What you lookin' at?
2950/1:Huh.
2951/0:Hey.
2951/1:Oh, sure.
2952/0:We're on guard now.  We take extra precautions.  And the SSC is out in full force.
2953/0:Aren't we high and mighty...
2953/1:Feeb must be lost...
2953/2:Who YOU lookin' at?
2953/3:Things are hard all over.
2953/4:Looks like YOU'RE doin' okay for yourself.
2954/0:
2955/0:Flashin' the cash... Huh, bro'?
2956/0:Flashin' the cash... Huh, sister?
2957/0:Where will you pick me up?
2958/0:Pwww!
2958/1:Go slither back into your enclave.
2959/0:Hi, officer.
2959/1:Great job you guys are doin'.  I mean it.  // insincere
2960/0:Officer.  // sneering
2960/1:Huh. // rude
2961/0:It will be an end to hierarchy -- as soon as you and JC share your abilities with the world.
2962/0:The beacon is currently off-line due to a lack of power.  To contact your pilot, you'll first need to turn on the generator inside the facility.
2963/0:Had to get out of town pretty fast.  Fortunately, this guy Leo needed a ride and could give me some fuel money.
2964/0:One accident down here -- WHAMMO!  We could lose power to the whole building.
2965/0:They're just protectin' their turf.  Doesn't bother me.
2966/0:I hope the situation around here doesn't get worse.
2967/0:Don't run out on me, girl.
2968/0:Pass is good all night.
2969/0:Groovy.
2969/1:I know how to pick a shot.
2969/2:Boom.
2970/0:That's what happens, feeb.
2971/0:I shot the scab...
2972/0:Agent Sparks is one of ours, Alex.  What are you trying to prove?  If I wasn't under direct orders from Chairman Dumier, I would have you detained.
2973/0:Was it the strikers -- the Panzerwerks union?  I thought they were friends of the Church.
2974/0:Got the dirty gob.
2975/0:Yeah...  Got ya in tight...
2976/0:Funny.  Ha-ha, and meanwhile my daughter Eeva goes missing at the Tarsus Academy in the arcology.  All of us, hunted like greasels.
2977/0:Can't scrip' it up close, huh?
2977/1:Do or die, feeb.
2978/0:It's really too bad that groups like the Order can't see what we're working for.
2979/0:Excellent.
2980/0:Oooooo, yeah...
2980/1:Just how I like it done.
2981/0:For the first time in years, citizens in Old Cairo are able to walk in the open air without the aid of breathers or other apparatus.  Besides the visibly clearer atmosphere, doctors hope to see a decline in the symptoms associated with what is commonly called Plague-11.
2982/0:Now I'ma feed ya to the gobs.
2983/0:I'll pay your WTO dues if you'll give me that key.  [300 credits]
2984/0:A lady should not walk here alone.
2985/0:Scab thought he was hard.
2986/0:Cash reward for information leading to the identification of Templar high priests.
2987/0:... cuttin' me out again.
2987/1:Says if I don't pay I'm gob meat.
2987/2:Think it's contamination, gettin' in my food...
2987/3:Don't know WHERE I'ma crash if that goes down.
2988/0:That's hard.
2988/1:I feel for ya.
2988/2:Man.  // deep sympathy
2989/0:My condolences with respect to your daughter.  At least you're okay.
2990/0:I've about had it.
2990/1:But just wait.  I've got a plan.
2990/2:Ain't gonna be down for long, though.
2990/3:I'm not takin' it anymore.
2991/0:Sure.  // sincere, encouraging.
2991/1:Well, good luck.  I mean it.
2991/2:You'll get through.  You always do.
2992/0:Yeah, man, stand your ground.
2993/0:So you're serious -- leaving all your work at Tarsus behind so you can join this church.  How do you know we can trust THEM?  They attacked the apartments and put us in danger.
2994/0:Yeah, girl, stand your ground.
2995/0:We appreciate your resourcefulness in seeking us out.
2996/0:Tell Dumier he's gonna have to look for an assassin somewhere else.
2997/0:Suit yourself.
2998/0:This city is lost.  Toxic air and fanatics enforcing martial law.
2999/0:(grunt)
2999/1:(grunt) Get this thing out of my way!
3000/0:Everything's under control.
3001/0:I'm on my way to the SSC Station right now.  Can you give me directions?
3002/0:
3003/0:Sis' thought she was hard.
3004/0:Ah yes, it appears Kurzcec has found us another customer.
3005/0:Maybe that's why they all left -- the soda selection.
3006/0:(laugh) Check it out.
3007/0:Huh... a pretty one... took a wrong turn, I guess.
3008/0:We got the scab.
3009/0:It better be dead.
3010/0:See ya later, alligator.
3011/0:Just a pup.
3012/0:Sack of slime...
3013/0:Oh yeah?  Oh yeah...?
3013/1:I'm waitin'.
3014/0:Better stab out while you got the chance...
3014/1:You're one ugly scab...
3015/0:You're telling ME.  I know a guy who works at Symmetriad.  He says nanoformers could rebuild all of Seattle in about five years.
3016/0:That's too much.  Forget it.
3016/1:That area's too dangerous.  I'm not going in.
3017/0:Ommm...  Focus... Now I am ready.
3017/1:Prepare to engage the enemy.
3017/2:For Her Holiness!
3017/3:Order demands your extermination.
3017/4:Your chaos must be stopped.
3017/5:You are obstacle in my Search.
3017/6:You will sow no more Chaos.
3017/7:You cannot see Order -- your end is near.
3017/8:You're dead!
3017/9:Say your prayers!
3018/0:First take care of the missile batteries.  They need to be disabled in order for me to get away safely.
3019/0:Just visiting Upper Seattle.
3020/0:For Her Holiness!
3020/1:C'mon -- Let's show 'em what we're made of.
3021/0:Right below us.  They're going through the apartments.
3022/0:Take him down!
3023/0:Take her down!
3024/0:Gotta take that thing down.
3024/1:At least targets like this keep things interesting...
3025/0:They left behind one of the Tarsus Directors.  I don't think they're going to leave us high and dry.
3026/0:Let's flip for who has to deal with THIS one.
3027/0:It's not too late!  Just stop right now, and you won't bring that monster back into the world.
3028/0:Maybe I'll do some sightseeing in New Cairo.  I'll let you know if I come across anything.
3029/0:Blasted greasels...
3030/0:Oh great.  Then where's the momma?
3031/0:They may be small, but they're still dangerous.
3032/0:Wait -- You're just going to leave without searching?  Don't you want to know what's really going on?  If they're really innocent, Tarsus and Nassif have no reason to hide anything from us.
3033/0:Know who put that there?
3034/0:Hey....  Hey!  Who took it?
3035/0:Totaled.  What do you think?
3036/0:I cannot wait until everything gets back to normal.
3037/0:Know how it got trashed?
3038/0:Hang with me and drop this gob-eater.
3039/0:Yo, why's it acting up?
3040/0:(laugh) Too easy.
3040/1:You're done.
3041/0:It's down.  What's the deal?
3042/0:Thought you was quick, huh?  Thought you was hard.  Thought you was a killer.
3043/0:Hey!  Did someone throw that?
3044/0:Let's go.
3045/0:See?  Back each other up and we win.
3046/0:How'd that get turned on?
3047/0:I need some firepower.  Give me the SMG.  [800]
3048/0:He's still got some kick.
3049/0:How'd that get turned off?
3050/0:She's still got some kick.
3051/0:What's the deal?  Somebody just open this?
3052/0:This stuff at Tarsus today just proves my point -- The Order needs to be banned from WTO grounds.
3053/0:Bite THIS, gob.
3054/0:We need to find the right balance between truth and persuasion -- between a complete science of mind and the value system that follows from it.
3055/0:I'll finish it off.
3056/0:(grunt)
3056/1:(grunt)
3057/0:Your turn, scab!
3057/1:Oh my god...
3058/0:I hope karkians don't smell any worse when they're dead...
3059/0:Makes sense.  You look like the enclave type.
3060/0:Neutralizing something like this was NOT in the manual.
3061/0:I'll get you this time.
3061/1:You're not getting away again.
3061/2:You've returned.
3061/3:So, we meet again.
3061/4:Order will be served this time.
3061/5:Her Holiness, help me finish this.
3061/6:I'm going to take care of you, once and for all.
3061/7:You cannot escape Order.
3061/8:Back again!
3061/9:Hate to leave a job unfinished...
3062/0:This time, we'll finish you off.
3062/1:Here we go again.
3063/0:I can hardly believe it is true.  The Headmaster WAS plotting against us.
3064/0:Prepare to defend yourself.
3064/1:You'd best draw your weapon.
3065/0:When they are worthy, we will share our wisdom with them.  Until then, we must shield them.
3066/0:It will be interesting to see whether the world powers will fund our re-organization, or whether they will decide that it's time to beef up their own forces.
3067/0:I've got you in my sights now...
3067/1:Steady...  steady...
3068/0:You followers haven't expelled you yet?
3069/0:Uh-huh...
3070/0:Didn't these protests end up shutting down the factory several times?
3071/0:It's hard to explain terrorism to a child.
3072/0:Yes -- I talked to Tracer Tong.  He says that Her Holiness is being held by the Templars.
3073/0:Thanks.  Now I've got a toxic spill AND a major liability running right through it.
3074/0:This is what I think the WTO should do.  Hang KEEP OUT signs at every checkpoint and replace those SSC flunkies with WTO military.
3075/0:She is a great leader and a great friend.  You completely misunderstand our work.  The Collapse would have been far more devastating if Nicolette and I hadn't accepted her family's legacy and rebuilt the Illuminati organization, which was nearly destroyed by MJ-12.
3076/0:Thanks for the tip.  It sounds like you got yourself to safety just in time.
3077/0:As much as you can trust anyone who takes bribes.  Now -- leave me be.  Let's make an effort not to be seen together.
3078/0:What's the deal?  Somebody just shut this?
3079/0:Who turned on the light?
3080/0:Who turned off the light?
3081/0:What's the deal?  Think a person caused that?
3082/0:You killed him!
3083/0:Some nut set a fire.  Any idea who?
3084/0:I will reimburse you.  Perhaps in a few weeks when the shop's cash reserves are replenished.
3085/0:You killed her!
3086/0:Yo, what's up with that smoke?
3087/0:Not your typical scab -- be careful.
3088/0:You know you're living in an age of warlords when people start running around calling themselves Knights.
3089/0:
3090/0:He killed him!
3091/0:Whose blood?
3092/0:He killed her!
3093/0:Someone been fightin'?
3094/0:Mmm, what do I see?  An exceptional young man.  Modified, correct?  Lovingly grown in an enclave -- and now you step into the dangerous world.  Stay ready, Tarik.
3095/0:She killed him!
3096/0:Check it out.  Over there.
3096/1:The scab's still around here somewhere.  Check it out.
3097/0:At least you can hide from paladins.  The nanite swell was everywhere.
3098/0:Then ApostleCorp has already lost everything.  Rescue Her Holiness.  Save the Summit for the sake of both factions.  They will help you against the Templars.  You will need the help of the WTO and Order just a little while longer...
3099/0:She killed her!
3100/0:The ApostleCorp laboratory is underneath the Black Gate.  That's where she is being held.
3101/0:One nanoformer bot, but it's been so long since we've had an emergency that it's fallen apart.  I can't believe someone tried to slip toxic waste past us.
3102/0:Stinkin' gob -- you're DEAD!
3103/0:Just keep it up.  You always want to get fancy at the end.
3104/0:Hey -- I'm running.
3105/0:Scrip' it, girl.
3106/0:
3107/0:Fall back!
3107/1:Withdraw!
3107/2:Pull back.  I said, pull back!
3108/0:Flank the enemy!
3108/1:Don't let the enemy escape!
3109/0:Just let me know if you hear any news about you-know-what.
3110/0:If we don't find the mods, they could end up installed in almost anyone.  We've got to track that garbage down and destroy it.
3111/0:Hit him from every side!
3111/1:Keep him off balance, fighting on multiple fronts.
3112/0:You had better take another look at the main chamber.  You were just teleported almost a half a mile.  I'm not surprised, though.  I was able to construct the Black Gate teleporter only with instructions from Helios.
3113/0:Hit her from every side!
3113/1:Keep her off balance, fighting on multiple fronts.
3114/0:Let's see if we can gain some ground here.
3114/1:We've got to narrow this gap, but carefully.
3115/0:The situation should be resolved shortly.
3116/0:
3117/0:Move, move, move!
3117/1:Charge!
3117/2:Let's show 'em what we're really made of!
3118/0:Do I look like her?
3119/0:Get him!
3120/0:We'll be securing the area.
3121/0:Get her!
3122/0:Maybe you should leave town.
3123/0:I already paid you.
3124/0:I can't help you any more than that.  I'm not going anywhere until the platform above has been cleared.
3125/0:You didn't hear this from me, but in case you want some spending money the employee ATM is in Cargo Bay 02 across the courtyard.  They never updated the firmware, which means it's pretty easy to hack, or so I've heard.
3126/0:I hope your purchases serve you well.
3127/0:
3127/1:
3127/2:
3127/3:
3128/0:I saw somethin' goin' down over there.
3129/0:Shhh.  I'm talkin' about the Champ, Gob-zilla.  Follow me?  She's still at Tina's pad in the Heron's Loft building near the Inclinator.  Apartment 22.  I'll give you a bounty if that gob dies [100 credits], plus you get to make bank on the four-to-one situation.  Cool?
3130/0:I saw it.  Hey, yo, go that way.
3131/0:The dude's over there.
3131/1:He can't be far.  Maybe over there.
3132/0:The chick's over there.
3132/1:She can't be far.  Maybe over there.
3133/0:Not that I want to see anyone get hurt, but I'd pay to see someone break in and set fire to their inventory of coffee beans.
3134/0:Scrip' it, bro'.
3135/0:Sounds like the scab's over that way.
3136/0:Ma'am.
3137/0:I try to explain the ways of the Order to my family, but they just dismiss me.
3138/0:I don't think the feeb heard ya.
3139/0:Beats me.
3139/1:No idea.
3139/2:Just got here.
3140/0:(laughs) Did you see the look on that feeb's face?
3140/1:Done like a killer.  Nice.
3141/0:Hi.
3141/1:What you lookin' at?
3142/0:Sloppy, but you got him.
3143/0:Shut your face.
3143/1:Right on.
3144/0:Sloppy, but you got her.
3145/0:(growl) ... feebs and scabs...
3145/1:Great digs.
3145/2:Hi.
3145/3:I'm busy.
3145/4:I got my own problems.
3146/0:We've got trouble.  I spotted a Seeker coming our way.  Look, there's no reason for me to drag a trainee into a firefight.  Why don't you try to slip out before I start shooting.
3147/0:You all right?
3147/1:Jeez!  Don't get yourself killed!
3148/0:That's right -- I'm lookin' at YOU, dude.
3149/0:I'm the security chief for this facility.  We were alerted to your presence shortly after your arrival in Cairo.
3150/0:Watch it -- scab can fight.
3151/0:Roll-'em snake-eyes!  Lemme see you spit!
3152/0:Stick it out!  He's yours.
3153/0:Stick it out!  She's yours.
3154/0:Don't feeb on me!  Hey!
3154/1:Where YOU goin'?
3155/0:Infidel!  
3155/1:Philistine!  Taste the wrath of the Order!
3155/2:You and the chaos you serve will be stopped.
3156/0:Won't be long now.
3156/1:Her Holiness is watching over us.
3157/0:Just one more hit, and she's done for.
3158/0:Just one more hit, and he's done for.
3159/0:All of the best ones.  It's a shame you won't live to experience true understanding.
3160/0:Hey mom, can I keep it?
3161/0:This place is going to the dogs...
3162/0:(gasp)  How can you say that?
3163/0:Love ya babe, but let's NOT swap some spit.
3164/0:Hey, yo, we don't need no feebs jumping in the ring.
3165/0:Dr. Patton, please report to the ballistics lab.
3166/0:I hope your purchases serve you well.
3167/0:Versalife established an outpost here and set us on the ice to test our reactions to extreme conditions.  We were the next generation of a project launched in Roswell.  We were to be unstoppable ground troops, unfazed by cold or radiation.  In other cases, our DNA was to be harvested to create biomodifications for humans, so that they could survive the aftermath of a nuclear war.
3168/0:I just gotta stay awake -- that's why I came by Queequeg's.
3169/0:Our children can't sleep at night because they can't breathe this filth, but that's about to change.  You look like you've got more than enough credits to buy breathers for our families.
3170/0:I'll give up my life before I let someone paw through our data.
3171/0:That's right -- I'm lookin' at YOU, missy.
3172/0:Yeah?  What do YOU know?
3172/1:(grumble)
3173/0:Hey -- I'm running.
3174/0:(clears throat)  // nervous
3174/1:How's it goin', officer?! // overly chipper
3175/0:Does he think that these facilities are free?  It costs money to constantly upgrade their hardware and keep it running.
3176/0:Uh, hi!
3176/1:Yeah... cool.  Good to see you guys around.  // unconvincing
3177/0:Help!
3177/1:Get the scab!  Somebody!  Hurry!
3178/0:... gotta do it if I want the cash...
3178/1:... shakin' up the whole scene...
3178/2:Pulled on me, from out the pocket, plasma slugs...
3178/3:Threatenin' my friends...
3179/0:Somebody get this guy!
3180/0:It ain't right.
3180/1:Bummer.
3180/2:I've been there.  // sympathy
3181/0:We're on guard now.  We take extra precautions.  And the SSC is out in full force.
3182/0:Somebody get this chick!
3183/0:... but I can stand up to it.
3183/1:But I think I got it all worked out.
3183/2:Just watch, though.   You'll see.
3183/3:That's where I draw the line.
3184/0:You need somethin', just let me know.
3184/1:Helluva situation.
3184/2:I'd break some skulls if it was me.
3184/3:Someone's gotta come clean.
3185/0:That's right, man.
3186/0:That's right, girl.
3187/0:We've been with the program since we were thirteen years old.  Why are you so quick to abandon that?  What can the Order offer you?
3188/0:First drop me near downtown.
3189/0:Now what about the compensation.
3190/0:That's why Eeva and Jennifer were hiding -- they'd found out about the Headmaster's plans for them.
3191/0:I can't let you do that.  I'm going to take you down, but I'll try to leave you breathing.  I don't want to kill you, Billie.
3192/0:Tarsus Tracking Report 4117 -- Alex D.  There are concerns that D. may be the greatest threat among her peers.  Last seen in Cairo, questioning Leila Nassif for the WTO.   Intel suggests that she now has objectives in Trier.  This makes it imperative that we get our agent through the gate immediately and shut it down.
3193/0:I guess we better start inspecting the cargo a bit more closely.
3194/0:These aren't supposed to be on.
3195/0:These aren't supposed to be on.
3196/0:... a bit smokey here... 
3197/0:What a big nothing the Order turned out to be.  They redecorated the mosque.  What else?  I wanted to believe, but what sort of order is this?  Perpetual killing.  Gang warfare.  Just like before they came.
3198/0:... a bit smokey here... 
3199/0:... blood...
3200/0:... blood...
3201/0:Shadows...
3202/0:Shadows...
3203/0:I can handle my own affairs.
3204/0:And don't make me file another complaint about corruption.  I'm up to my EARS in corruption.  Smugglers.  Dodgy business owners.  Meanwhile half of Lower Seattle banging on the walls wanting CITIZENSHIP in this zoo.
3205/0:
3205/1:
3205/2:
3205/3:
3205/4:
3206/0:The entrance to the mosque is on this level.  You'll notice that the village has been decimated by a disease called Plague 11 thanks to WTO indifference to nanite pollution.  Dr. Nassif comes from a poor family in the area.  If you and Billie help the locals, maybe they will put you on her trail.
3207/0:Luminon Saman from the German Shard.  My pleasure.  I was HOPING one of Billie's former classmates would show up.
3208/0:
3209/0:Hmmm... fire.
3210/0:I wouldn't make it far without the missiles disabled.
3211/0:Serious.  Back off.
3212/0:Hmmm... fire.
3213/0:Looks like this area's seen action recently.
3214/0:Looks like this area's seen action recently.
3215/0:I wonder what the story is behind that burn damage.
3216/0:And don't make me file another complaint about corruption.  I'm up to my EARS in corruption.  Smugglers.  Dodgy business owners.  Meanwhile half of Lower Seattle banging on the walls wanting CITIZENSHIP in this zoo.
3217/0:I wonder what the story is behind that burn damage.
3218/0:
3219/0:Hmmm... Bullet holes.
3220/0:Warning -- Autonomous security systems have been compromised.
3221/0:Hmmm... Bullet holes.
3222/0:They never should have messed with us.
3223/0:Someone's fired a boltcaster here.  And missed.
3224/0:Someone's fired a boltcaster here.  And missed.
3225/0:What do you need?
3226/0:
3227/0:Killed in the line of duty.  At least it's noble, I guess...
3228/0:To prepare, we urge arcology residents to complete their business in the medina in the next several days in order to minimize the time they will need to spend in Old Cairo.
3229/0:I ran into this commando by the landing pad.
3230/0:Would I be running if there was an emergency?  Me?  You never heard the name Leo Jankowski in Chicago?
3231/0:We can after we eliminate the leadership of these factions and destroy whatever it is JC Denton is building inside the Statue.
3232/0:Exactly.  THEY do all of the choosing.  First I'm not from the right family, now they shut me out because I'm sick.  No one works their way up from Plague 11.
3233/0:Who are you -- some PR lady coming to talk me out of it?  I will not give in.  Pequod's runs ads on the public terminal right across the street from my shop, and they don't even have a branch in Trier!
3234/0:Fine.  Have it your way.
3235/0:A good cause.  Let me see your finger.
3236/0:I wonder where this knife came from.
3237/0:I don't think that just moved on it's own...
3237/1:Eh?  I wonder how THAT happened.
3238/0:
3239/0:Eh?  I wonder how THAT happened.
3240/0:Hey!  It's missing.
3240/1:Where did it go?
3241/0:Hey!  It's missing.
3241/1:Where did it go?
3242/0:Hmm... That's not where it's supposed to be.
3242/1:This definitely wasn't here before.
3243/0:What are you selling?
3244/0:Hmm... That's not where it's supposed to be.
3244/1:This definitely wasn't here before.
3245/0:Yikes.  That's wrecked.
3245/1:I guess it didn't quite pass the structural integrity test there.
3246/0:The Nine Worlds is a no-weapons zone, strictly enforced since the riots.
3247/0:Yikes.  That's wrecked.
3247/1:I guess it didn't quite pass the structural integrity test there.
3248/0:I think we're done here.
3249/0:
3250/0:It's a universal faith.  You don't have to be religious to agree with the basic philosophy behind it.
3251/0:How stupid do you think I am?
3252/0:Alex, I'm on the north dock.  Come see me.
3253/0:The Templars are one step ahead of us, but not for long.  Repair the Gate with the Sequencing Module.  Find your long-lost older brother on the other side, then wait for my orders.
3254/0:Arcology scientists are presently investigating cleanup alternatives.
3255/0:I knew the Templars were dangerous, but who knew they were this powerful?
3256/0:Head south up the hill from the Inclinator. The old factory's just southeast across the street.
3257/0:
3257/1:
3258/0:
3259/0:Who wrecked this?
3259/1:I wonder how THAT happened.
3260/0:Who wrecked this?
3260/1:I wonder how THAT happened.
3261/0:First fight of the night... Take it from me, you missed a wet one.
3262/0:Huh.  This thing's been disabled.
3262/1:This shouldn't be shut down.
3263/0:Huh.  This thing's been disabled.
3263/1:This shouldn't be shut down.
3264/0:Whoa.  It's not supposed to do THAT.
3264/1:I think it's malfunctioning.
3265/0:Whoa.  It's not supposed to do THAT.
3265/1:I think it's malfunctioning.
3266/0:That was open, last I checked.
3266/1:I'm sure that's supposed to be closed...
3267/0:Tension has been high for months.  It just finally exploded.
3268/0:That was open, last I checked.
3268/1:I'm sure that's supposed to be closed...
3269/0:That was closed, last I checked.
3269/1:Open?  That seems wrong.
3270/0:That was closed, last I checked.
3270/1:Open?  That seems wrong.
3271/0:... SSC buys guns on the black market?
3272/0:JC awakens.  Soon the world will be different.
3273/0:
3274/0:Hey -- I'm running.
3275/0:
3276/0:They said I was sick, but in one of those power-armor suits, which they're getting ready to run off an assembly line... in one of those suits I'm as good as ANY MAN.
3277/0:Ever since the strike at Panzerwerks, people have been treating my business as their own private amphitheater.
3278/0:I wonder how this got turned on.
3278/1:I could've sworn this was off.
3279/0:I wonder how this got turned on.
3279/1:I could've sworn this was off.
3280/0:I wonder how this got shut off.
3280/1:I could've sworn this was on.
3281/0:I wonder how this got shut off.
3281/1:I could've sworn this was on.
3282/0:The nanites actually began disintegrating him from the inside.  They put him in cryostate so that they could find a cure.
3283/0:Let's work together on this, shoulder-to-shoulder.
3283/1:Move forward.  That's an order.
3284/0:Great.  Pass on my thanks.
3285/0:No distractions, please.
3286/0:When you go to Antarctica and find JC, remember what hangs in the balance.  I haven't told you just how powerful JC has become.
3287/0:Let's work together on this, shoulder-to-shoulder.
3287/1:Move forward.  That's an order.
3288/0:Move in!
3288/1:All hands ready.  Full assault!
3289/0:Move in!
3289/1:All hands ready.  Full assault!
3290/0:Rush him!
3291/0:Rush him!
3292/0:Rush her!
3293/0:Rush her!
3294/0:May Her Holiness watch over you.
3295/0:Most cities are begging to be incorporated.  
3296/0:Hello.
3296/1:Peace, my friend.
3296/2:Curious about the Church?  Spend time with a Her Holiness presence.  Our holocomms are everywhere.
3297/0:Some tasty gobbait -- check it out...
3298/0:This is not a zoo.
3299/0:The trader handles business.  I am here to prevent unfair transactions.
3300/0:We are not permitted to know the identities of the test subjects.
3301/0:Sure, everybody knows that Queequeg's and Pequod's are rivals.  I don't think that makes it okay to break the law.
3302/0:Give me the key to the penthouse's backdoor. [300]
3303/0:How'd you find out I was in Cairo?
3304/0:25% detox complete.
3305/0:You made a big mistake by crossing Mr. O'Rourke.
3306/0:Well... at least we tried.  Here's your money.
3307/0:I guess the Versalife scientists all fled after the Collapse?  Or maybe they died off.  No way to know for sure.  In the end, they got what they deserved, though.
3308/0:Yeah, I can find my way out, but -- hey -- look at me again.  I was right, wasn't I?  You're MODIFIED.  You're a stinkin' DEFILER!
3309/0:We'll be securing the area.
3310/0:I can't get past this thing! 
3310/1:This is only going to slow me down, not stop me.
3311/0:Thanks.  ApostleCorp must be a pretty serious threat to be a concern to the Director of the WTO.
3312/0:I can't get past this thing! 
3312/1:This is only going to slow me down, not stop me.
3313/0:Yes... an unmarked suite, southeast corner of the arcology.  I think there is an ATM out front.
3314/0:Who has time to worry about terrorists in the arcology?  The medina is free!  The plague is over!
3315/0:Argh!  The door won't open!
3315/1:Did someone lock this?
3316/0:I did.  He didn't get me any closer to finding Dr. Nassif, either.
3317/0:Argh!  The door won't open!
3317/1:Did someone lock this?
3318/0:(grunt)
3318/1:(grunt) I'm not going around -- I'm going through.
3319/0:You got lucky there.
3319/1:Damn!
3320/0:(grunt)
3320/1:(grunt) I'm not going around -- I'm going through.
3321/0:You got lucky there.
3321/1:Damn!
3322/0:I'm punching holes in air over here.
3322/1:I'm not connecting.
3323/0:I'm punching holes in air over here.
3323/1:I'm not connecting.
3324/0:This one has some training.
3325/0:What's the problem?  You scared?
3326/0:This one has some training.
3327/0:That thing has nine lives.
3328/0:That thing has nine lives.
3329/0:Pardon the simplicity of this drawing, but I like to give newcomers a map so that they can find their way around.  The local business owners are always complaining that they don't get enough foot traffic.
3330/0:What a terrible world to bring a child into.
3331/0:
3331/1:
3331/2:
3331/3:
3332/0:You've just got to use your head sometimes.
3333/0:I'm stuck out here. (cough cough)  And I haven't been able to work on any of my poetry...  I was always meant to be an arcology citizen.  No one here will ever appreciate my writing.
3334/0:Right, I hear he's taken an unhealthy interest in my architecture.  I hear he's even put out a hit on me.
3335/0:Friend, the time has come to prepare our OWN government.
3336/0:Been here ten years.
3337/0:You can't hide!
3337/1:Cleared the sector, at least.
3338/0:You can't hide!
3338/1:Cleared the sector, at least.
3338/2:Running away?  Huh?
3338/3:Where are you?!
3339/0:Another obstacle in your Search, young Seeker -- as the director told you, the inclinator, which is the only way to reach Lower Seattle and our church, has been shut down because of a toxic spill.  No one there seems equal to the task, but I'm sure you can find a way to continue on this path toward Order.
3340/0:Coward.
3341/0:Coward.
3341/1:Afraid to face me?
3341/2:You know, I took classes on this stuff.
3341/3:Don't think I'm gonna give you a clean shot...
3342/0:Gone.  Sorry, I lost the trail.
3342/1:I don't have a target.
3343/0:Gone.  Sorry, I lost the trail.
3343/1:I don't have a target.
3343/2:We're getting close... 
3343/3:Don't let your guard down!
3343/4:Spread out -- let's do this right.
3343/5:Let's finish this.  No more screw-ups.
3344/0:Is this a sales pitch?  Why don't you get to the punchline.
3345/0:Yes.  Missionaries.
3346/0:Better not see his face around here again...
3347/0:An interesting discovery.  So Dr. Nassif has a cousin at the Tarsus Academy in New Cairo.  The visitation pass will let you enter the school on Level 107 of the arcology.  Find the cousin, Eeva, and see if she leads you to ApostleCorp.
3348/0:
3349/0:Better not see his face around here again...
3350/0:Finley, we're eternally grateful for your simplifying some of our commerce and transportation issues.  After what just happened in Chicago, however, we're much more concerned about security issues.  It might be a good idea to keep that recent delivery in storage for a bit longer.
3351/0:We gave him a good scare, huh?
3352/0:We gave him a good scare, huh?
3352/1:We'll find him.
3352/2:When we find him, he's in for a world of pain.
3352/3:Watch your backs -- he's a tricky one.
3353/0:They'll be watching to see how we handle ourselves.
3354/0:Let's go.
3355/0:It's not too late.  Just because you took one assignment for the WTO doesn't mean that the Order won't accept you.  Talk to Lin May.  The Order needs your help and has its own interests in the Mako facility.
3356/0:
3357/0:This is JC's habitat.  He came to Antarctica seeking peace.  In turmoil from the merger with the artificial intelligence, Helios, he constructed this place with his mind, using his new power over materials.  The habitat erupted from the landscape, a living technological building, infused with his psyche.
3358/0:See, I drop my birds on the curb.  You're on the roof of the Mako Ballistics main complex.  I got you past the bots and surveillance downstairs. 
3359/0:Yeah, tell it to the Chief.
3360/0:I have completed my research and have identifed subjects Abana Khodair, Eeva Nassif, and Jennifer McAllister as the greatest threats to Purity.  I am prepared to terminate the abominations as soon as I receive official orders.
3361/0:Get your equipment.  I'll watch your back.
3362/0:Better not see her face around here again...
3363/0:How much you got?
3364/0:How much do you charge your passengers?
3365/0:Better not see her face around here again...
3366/0:We gave her a good scare, huh?
3367/0:We gave her a good scare, huh?
3367/1:Keep your eyes peeled -- she's out there somewhere.
3367/2:Don't let her sneak up on us...
3367/3:Watch your backs -- she's a tricky one.
3368/0:Got rid of it, at least.
3369/0:Got rid of it, at least.
3370/0:If you're lying, I'll find out soon enough.
3371/0:Get back here!
3371/1:Come back and fight!
3372/0:Get back here!
3372/1:Come back and fight!
3373/0:You're marked, beggar.  You're MARKED!
3374/0:You're marked, beggar.  You're MARKED!
3375/0:No one has yet claimed responsibility for the attack on Chicago.  We don't know with any certainty whether it was an accident, an ideological strike against the WTO enclave there, or something else.  Fortunately, we were able to evacuate the trainees there.  They will be joining us at this location and you will be meeting them shortly.  We appreciate your patience during this stressful period.
3376/0:What's going on?  I saw one of your troopers killed.
3377/0:Where next?
3378/0:When I merged with Helios in the 2050's, I never dreamed that I would have to wait twenty years for a chance to implement my plans.
3379/0:In time, you will join us.  Of that, I can be certain.  I know every detail of your life.  I was the Project Director of the Tarsus facility in Chicago.
3380/0:Watch for me from the air.  I have business in the arcology.
3381/0:So instead you "neutralize" the children yourself, rather than let them be polluted?
3382/0:
3383/0:Why was he frozen?
3384/0:50% detox complete.
3385/0:
3386/0:
3387/0:Of course, he JUST changed the code.  And we've got no way to reach him.  Seems like the radiation is scrambling communications.
3388/0:Get moving.  You have work to do for the Grand Master.
3389/0:But where does the Order fit into all of this?  I thought they were a world church, not private investigators.  I need to know more before I start making decisions.
3390/0:What's going on?  I have a right to know if I'm in danger.
3391/0:They never think they'll get caught, do they?
3391/1:Keep the target in range.
3392/0:They never think they'll get caught, do they?
3392/1:Keep the target in range.
3393/0:Don't let it get away!
3394/0:Don't let it get away!
3395/0:She must be hurt.
3395/1:She's trying to get away!
3396/0:She must be hurt.
3396/1:She's trying to get away!
3397/0:He must be hurt.
3397/1:He's trying to get away!
3398/0:He must be hurt.
3398/1:He's trying to get away!
3399/0:The beggar's modified!  // surprise
3400/0:The beggar's modified!  // surprise
3401/0:
3402/0:I've completed Phase I of the Omar induction.  They said I would have two months to decide whether to accept the cortical interface, which will make me a true Omar, but they are afraid the Templars will attack the medina.  They want me to undergo Phase II immediately.
3403/0:And Mako Ballistics is reporting that terrorists have infiltrated their Redmond facility and have stolen the plans for a weapon prototype.
3404/0:We're having a private conversation.
3405/0:When I say that to people, they laugh and call me naive.
3406/0:Things sure have been crazy around here lately.
3407/0:The Elite Commando has been killed, but we still have you.  Remember what I said about Paul.  He and JC want to impose biomodification worldwide -- a nanite plague worse than the one in Cairo.  Help us keep the technology under control.
3408/0:Even though Archer was stopped, they have managed to take over most of Cairo and now we're trapped here.
3409/0:Can't afford that biomod. [500]
3410/0:
3411/0:Good, you found the facility.  Transmit the specification to the WTO orbiting science platform, Ophelia, then you will be free to kill that self-styled Savior and destroy his illegal machine.
3412/0:Is that a salaried position or purely ceremonial?
3413/0:It's an even match.  They can't get in, but we can't get out.
3414/0:I know you're cloaked.
3415/0:I know you're cloaked.
3416/0:Watch it!  He's got some sort of cloaking ability.
3417/0:Watch it!  He's got some sort of cloaking ability.
3418/0:Sid Black.  How'd you end up in Cairo?
3419/0:Watch it!  She's got some sort of cloaking ability.
3420/0:Watch it!  She's got some sort of cloaking ability.
3421/0:Enough chit-chat.  I've got to think through my business plan.
3422/0:Guess explosives aren't gonna work...
3423/0:No one forced me into the covert ops program.
3424/0:Guess explosives aren't gonna work...
3425/0:A skull gun!
3426/0:Which is why we can pass through the Gate and enter this place.
3427/0:Listen to me -- I'm sure you have more important things to do today.
3428/0:A skull gun!
3429/0:All WTO personnel are required to adhere to the air terminal security policies.  Please refer to section 407.23 of your field manual.
3430/0:I'm sorry, but access is restricted.  Thank you for your interest.
3431/0:Do not betray the trust of the Illuminati.
3432/0:Do you know anything about Flight Bay 24?
3433/0:I don't have that kind of cash.  [750]
3434/0:
3435/0:Loyal seeker, your next objective is to help us find Dr. Nassif. She comes from a poor family in the plague-stricken village outside the arcology walls.  You'll have to make your way to Level 108.  Billie is waiting for you in the mosque that separates the New Cairo arcology from the village.  She'll be coordinating the operation.
3436/0:So much hate here.  And fear.
3437/0:75% detox complete.
3438/0:
3439/0:
3440/0:Phew!  Looks like I don't have to worry about that thug anymore.
3441/0:Phew!  Looks like I don't have to worry about that thug anymore.
3442/0:They haven't been able to unlock my cockpit yet.  I'm ready to fly as soon as you do two things.  First disable the ground-to-air missile batteries, then go to the control room to activate the pilot beacon.
3443/0:Taken care of.  Let's just say I'm a fan of Pequod's coffee.
3444/0:Phew!  What a relief!  The killer's gone.
3445/0:You escaped this time, but let that be a lesson.  There will be serious consequences if you continue to oppose the Order Church.  I expect you to listen to me from now on.
3446/0:Thanks.
3447/0:The last place the authorities will look is the Nur Gewehre shop.  I am a respected businessman.
3448/0:Phew!  What a relief!  The killer's gone.
3449/0:What can you tell me about the VIP area?
3450/0:I guess that thief decided to move on.
3451/0:The freak's got a skull gun!
3452/0:I guess that thief decided to move on.
3453/0:The freak's got a skull gun!
3454/0:I wonder what frightened it.
3455/0:You're fast, but I was trained to hit moving targets.
3456/0:I wonder what frightened it.
3457/0:You're fast, but I was trained to hit moving targets.
3458/0:Poor cat.
3459/0:He can really move!
3460/0:Poor cat.
3461/0:He can really move!
3462/0:She can really move!
3463/0:She can really move!
3464/0:Your sensor-disruption might fool the bots, but not me.
3465/0:
3466/0:Your sensor-disruption might fool the bots, but not me.
3467/0:In response to the following message:
3468/0:Sounds like a valuable invention.  Why aren't they manufacturing it?
3469/0:Although you did not help our kind, you answered the higher calling, to JC.  You are not our enemy.
3470/0:I don't even care WHAT it is they're transporting in there, just as long as the WTO gets their cut.
3471/0:It could hardly be worse than Plague 11.
3472/0:There are no more in Cairo.  They've all been terminated.
3473/0:They had to put up an energy-shield behind the targets cuz the beam goes through walls.
3474/0:She said that in the life sciences one should never be surprised when the snake swallows its own tail.
3475/0:I don't get it.  These new fights -- they're just a couple of starved lizards at each other's throats.
3476/0:Ew.  Dead cat.  Full of diseases...
3477/0:Tell me about Bud Puckett.
3478/0:Ew.  Dead cat.  Full of diseases...
3479/0:Something must've tried to pounce on that rat.
3480/0:The WTO ignored them as some tiny harmless cult.  Apparently they've got more followers than we expected.
3481/0:Something must've tried to pounce on that rat.
3482/0:Pleased to meet you, too.
3483/0:Thanks for your skill and discretion.  Here's that biomod canister I mentioned.
3484/0:Wonder what's been after that bird.
3485/0:The mechs won't work.  The enemy's disrupting sensors.
3486/0:
3487/0:Wonder what's been after that bird.
3488/0:The mechs won't work.  The enemy's disrupting sensors.
3489/0:Whoa.  What happened to that bot?
3490/0:Only a born fool provokes a Seeker...
3491/0:Yeah, I've met with her and been briefed.
3492/0:We prepare for the new world and will stop those who threaten it's coming.
3493/0:Whoa.  What happened to that bot?
3494/0:That bot... something's really wrong here.
3495/0:Now you'll pay!
3496/0:So you're the one... murderer!
3496/1:Ready for this?  I call it 'instant karma.'
3497/0:It's the killer!
3498/0:Yeah?  All of it?
3499/0:...but I saw it in the news, all of Chicago, gone...
3500/0:That's right -- your old instructor's family has been developing illicit strains of crops without any regard for WTO regulations.  Destroy the hydroponics -- and maybe pick up a hint regarding Dr. Nassif's whereabouts in the process.
3501/0:Is he guilty?  Why is he being accused?
3502/0:
3503/0:Sit tight!?  I need to take off before it's too late!
3504/0:This isn't worth it.  You finish your fool's errand and I'll go back to the Templars.  Deal? 
3505/0:He could've at least given me my coffee for free.
3506/0:...been messing with the lights...
3507/0:...been messing with the lights...
3508/0:That should be on.
3509/0:That should be on.
3510/0:Can't get on the train without a pass.
3511/0:That should be off.
3512/0:That should be off.
3513/0:Just do a standard search.  We'll clear this up.
3513/1:Stay alert, Seekers.
3514/0:He was seen with a gang of local thugs linked to the Knights Templar.  He did a little moonlighting after the Tarsus raid by coordinating a prison-break.
3515/0:Am I seeing things?
3515/1:Maybe I need to get a better look...
3516/0:Thought he went down this way...
3517/0:There were an awful lot of strange files in Nassif's office -- All this stuff about test subjects and observation -- I can't imagine what that has to do with Tarsus.  You should see if you have more luck poking around.
3518/0:Am I seeing things?
3518/1:Maybe I need to get a better look...
3519/0:Thought she went down this way...
3520/0:I know I saw something.
3520/1:Uh oh.  I saw that.
3521/0:I know your niece.  She was my instructor at Tarsus Academy in Seattle.  I'm not here to kill anyone.
3522/0:I know I saw something.
3522/1:Uh oh.  I saw that.
3523/0:... danger... the enemy... very close...
3524/0:No thanks.
3525/0:Cheer up.  The Plague is gone.
3526/0:No!  Get outta there!  Go!  Go!  Go!
3527/0:I don't know what sort of funny business you have in mind, but if that woman dies so do you.  Now get your butt to the SSC station.  Move!
3528/0:I don't have much to offer as a reward, but maybe I can help you against the terrorists.  My husband works for the SSC.  He's training in Madrid right now, but I know the code to the SSC kiosk in the arcology.  6673.  Help yourself to any equipment you need.
3529/0:Thank God -- someone from the outside.  I'd make a run for the medina if the floor of the mosque could be secured, but no one will fight.  Seekers.  SSC.  They've all vanished.
3530/0:It's so sad that you believe all that.  I'll put you out of your misery.
3531/0:
3532/0:I applied for infusions, but they said my lipids were weak.  I think I should get a second opinion.
3533/0:Maybe I need to get my hearing checked...
3533/1:That sure did sound like something.
3534/0:Maybe I need to get my hearing checked...
3534/1:That sure did sound like something.
3535/0:I felt something there.
3535/1:What just touched me?
3536/0:I felt something there.
3536/1:What just touched me?
3537/0:Let's go.
3538/0:Seekers closing in and our own security system turned against us -- we're trapped!
3539/0:(grunt)  Where did that come from?
3539/1:(grunt) Is ANYWHERE safe these days?!
3540/0:There is still more work to be done.
3541/0:(grunt)  Where did that come from?
3541/1:(grunt) Is ANYWHERE safe these days?!
3542/0:Lesser of the evils offered at this point.  The other entities all want you to revive the man responsible for the Collapse.  What good can that possibly accomplish?  ApostleCorp wants to worship him and the Illuminati wants to try to control him.  
3543/0:Oh my --
3543/1:(shriek)
3543/2:(yell)
3544/0:The toxin is extremely volatile.  Contact through evaporation alone can cause nausea and asphyxiation.
3545/0:Oh my --
3545/1:(shriek)
3545/2:(yell)
3546/0:Someone's been hurt.  It's not safe!
3546/1:Oh my God!  A body!
3547/0:Someone's been hurt.  It's not safe!
3547/1:Oh my God!  A body!
3548/0:Name and business, please.
3549/0:There's nothing in the WTO charter against religion.  No reason you can't believe in Her Holiness and still hold down a decent job.
3550/0:You believe everything you hear at a public terminal?  The media's controlled by the WTO.  Even this sorry scab standing next to me knows THAT.
3551/0:Thanks.
3552/0:Your business is with the Luminon and Dr. Todd.
3553/0:In a manner of speaking.  We won't hand our research over to fanatics -- not without a fight.
3554/0:Yeah?
3555/0:If they won't smuggle us out of the country, I say we do it ourselves.
3556/0:
3557/0:Guess I'll just wander around until they let me back into the building.
3558/0:But nothing.  Just learn to keep your mouth shut.  I need someone in Cairo I can count on.
3559/0:Extraordinary times, my young friend.
3560/0:I just gotta stay awake -- that's why I came by Queequeg's.
3561/0:
3562/0:He's unconscious!
3562/1:Oh God!  But at least it looks like he's still breathing.
3563/0:He's unconscious!
3563/1:Oh God!  But at least it looks like he's still breathing.
3564/0:What do you want?
3565/0:She's unconscious!
3565/1:Oh God!  But at least it looks like she's still breathing.
3566/0:She's unconscious!
3566/1:Oh God!  But at least it looks like she's still breathing.
3567/0:I took personal responsibility for Trier security.  I guess I have to take responsibility for what happened to Max.
3568/0:A dead body!
3568/1:Murder!
3569/0:A dead body!
3569/1:Murder!
3570/0:I don't have time for smalltalk.  Take me back to downtown Trier.
3571/0:Someone killed him!
3571/1:A dead man!  How could this happen?
3572/0:You can't let the Templars or the Illuminati cloud your judgment.
3573/0:You are welcome to purchase technologies from us.
3574/0:Someone killed him!
3574/1:A dead man!  How could this happen?
3575/0:Someone killed her!
3575/1:A dead woman!  How could this happen?
3576/0:Someone killed her!
3576/1:A dead woman!  How could this happen?
3577/0:I'm glad that the new fellow is working out.  I've been hoping my little Gina will get accepted next year.
3578/0:People are edgy because a few students are missing.  I am not all that worried because I know Jennifer is too smart to let anything really terrible happen.
3579/0:It's in my system.  No tellin' WHAT it'll do to me.
3580/0:Now that the old nation-states are gone, the Statue can become a truly universal symbol.
3581/0:I closed up shop and came in here.  I decided it would be safer.
3582/0:He WAS working it off, then he lost a whole shipment of biocells to a WTO patrol.
3583/0:I'm just a fan.
3584/0:Stay close.
3585/0:This will probably cost me my job, but I'm going to do my best to get Her Holiness back.
3586/0:What is THAT?!
3586/1:Some sort of dead monster...
3587/0:What is THAT?!
3587/1:Some sort of dead monster...
3588/0:You can't fool me THAT easily...
3588/1:I see, someone's trying to distract me...
3589/0:You can't fool me THAT easily...
3589/1:I see, someone's trying to distract me...
3590/0:Smoke...  That's strange.
3591/0:Smoke...  That's strange.
3592/0:Just a shadow... I wonder...?
3593/0:Just a shadow... I wonder...?
3594/0:I'm a diplomat.  I speak kindly to all, but I choose my friends based on their actions alone.
3595/0:Looks like there's been a fight here....
3596/0:Looks like there's been a fight here....
3597/0:I was hoping you would show more restraint.  Our enemies will be easy to absorb once JC is revived.
3598/0:You want me to steal a carcass -- from a nightclub?
3599/0:You're our personal savior.  First you got Mina into the academy, now this.  Next you'll tell me that you're the reason Nanite Swell 11 cleared up.
3600/0:Or some psych experiment?
3601/0:Ready for an extraction, sweets.  Just send word with the pilot beacon by Flight Bay 23.
3602/0:Where did that come from?
3603/0:Where did that come from?
3604/0:It's gone.
3605/0:It's gone.
3606/0:That's not where it belongs.
3607/0:Information not relevant.
3608/0:Good talkin' to ya.
3609/0:That's not where it belongs.
3610/0:Wonder what caused this damage... 
3611/0:Wonder what caused this damage... 
3612/0:Me?  I know a bad situation when I see one.
3613/0:Sounds like we will be able to relax now.
3614/0:Someone destroyed it!
3615/0:Someone destroyed it!
3616/0:
3617/0:I will be happy when SSC finally realizes they just need to run those Seekers out of town.
3618/0:You betrayed me.  Why?
3619/0:Time again for a... ta-a-alk BULLET!
3620/0:Yeah, I've met with her and been briefed.
3621/0:I didn't go to the WTO.  The only person I told about the Omar in the VIP area was NG Resonance.  Her simulation, the hologram in the club.
3622/0:I wanted to be close to the action.
3623/0:How terrible.  He'd escaped the Templar encampment only to meet his end here.
3624/0:
3625/0:I am satisfied.  Nothing remains that can challenge Grand Master Dumier.
3626/0:I'm not sightseeing.  I have business here.
3627/0:Our work is invisible, but just.  Humankind is well-served.
3628/0:That must be a maintenance building.  Maybe you can learn something from one of the civilian employees inside.
3629/0:Who has your jet?
3630/0:Looks like a bug.
3631/0:Like what?
3632/0:Never had a Pequochino in my life.  I heard it's gourmet and bio-enhanced.
3633/0:Looks like a bug.
3634/0:You can't just GIVE AWAY intellectual property.
3635/0:Hm.  It's been shut down.
3636/0:Hm.  It's been shut down.
3637/0:How did that get open?
3638/0:Actually, I already talked to Miss Withers.
3639/0:How did that get open?
3640/0:Economics.  That's why the WTO will always be on top.
3641/0:That should be open.
3642/0:That should be open.
3643/0:Why not make him work it off?
3644/0:It would be madness to reveal everything.  We must toil in secret to protect them from the harsh realities.
3645/0:It's on?  That's strange.
3646/0:It's on?  That's strange.
3647/0:Her Holiness will be pleased -- and you will be rewarded.  Praise Order, praise your loyalty.  Now, back on the trail of Dr. Nassif.  Our investigators have traced her contacts to the biolab at the top of the elevator on the north end of the complex.  Look for evidence there.
3648/0:My most sincere gratitude.  Our family is in dire need of a friend.
3649/0:You confuse us with your shifting loyalty.
3650/0:No more transactions possible -- inventory depleted.
3651/0:You must be Mathers.  Your supervisor sent me to find you. 
3652/0:We have good reason to believe that ApostleCorp's headquarters are in Cairo.  This is where she would go looking for help.  Hey, I almost forgot.  Here's something Chen wanted me to give you as a bonus for killing that Mako guy.
3653/0:An admirable gesture regarding my brother.  Unfortunately, you wrecked his life's work by handing the Aquinas hub to our enemy.  I just had one of my grays communicate this fact to him telepathically.
3654/0:
3655/0:Don't worry about me.  I'll find a way out.
3656/0:Come back and tell me what you find out.
3657/0:Ever since she didn't get into the Tarsus Academy, her infection has been getting worse.  She should be up on Level 107 right now, in her own dorm room, studying and breathing filtered air.  She's always been such a... good student... (sobs)
3658/0:I don't trust Sak, but I guess I'll do my job as long as I'm here.
3659/0:Too bad Mathers is trapped on the other platform.  He's got the code for the closet where the repairbot's stored...
3660/0:Who turned this off?
3661/0:Shrewd thinking.
3662/0:Who turned this off?
3663/0:I found the beacon and activated it.
3664/0:You risked your life?  For me?  I.... wish I had something more than a few credits to offer as a reward.
3665/0:Why's this blocked off?
3666/0:By the way, we let Miss Sparks go.  Chief Morgan has taken her out of the arcology.  I'm glad that we can trust each other, Alex.
3667/0:Why's this blocked off?
3668/0:I've got to get this door open.
3669/0:I've got to get this door open.
3670/0:(grunt) You're not going to stop me that easily.
3671/0:(grunt) You're not going to stop me that easily.
3672/0:I appreciate your candor, Luminon.  Now if you'll excuse me...
3673/0:Dossier uploaded.  Will shoot on sight.
3674/0:Maybe you should ask her for an endorsement.
3675/0:
3676/0:Under my guidance, Helios has restructured itself to synthesize and redistribute information freely.  It will become the collective consciousness of the human race.
3677/0:Actually, I --
3678/0:
3679/0:Good.  The Age of Light is upon us.
3680/0:
3681/0:Forget it, that's too dangerous.
3682/0:Forget it, that's too dangerous.
3683/0:Hold still... 
3683/1:Just about gotcha...
3684/0:Hold still... 
3684/1:Just about gotcha...
3685/0:Yes?
3685/1:For Purity.
3685/2:Our ranks are always open.
3686/0:Why the necessity for an enclave, I am often asked.  Why a barrier between Upper and Lower Seattle?  Citizens, growth must be managed and contained, or we are the playthings of market forces.  Dumier economics provide a bulwark against these... struggles, these... unpredictable numbers... a bulwark against another Collapse.
3687/0:Sir.
3688/0:Maybe I should leave town.  
3689/0:I'm sending in a bot.
3690/0:I'm sending in a bot.
3691/0:Here you go.  Just be careful -- that's the Culture Minister's place and he tends to entertain a lot.
3692/0:Find the Aquinas specification, transmit it to my team in Munich, then step into the machine inside the Statue.  My scientists will modify your nanite architecture into a delivery vehicle for our cellular defense mechanism.
3693/0:Greetings.  You are in close proximity to an entity of great interest to the Omar -- the cadaver of an unusual mutant.  We are interested in the properties of the mutant's tissues.  Please locate the biometric report.  We will upload the data through your infolink interface.  End of proposal.
3694/0:I would have picked up some slacks and a neck sweater if the Templars hadn't overrun the arcology.
3695/0:(pause)  You are an arrogant fool.  Dr. Todd is waiting for you in the flight bay.  Give him what he needs, or my paladins, who have been instructed to hold their fire, will instead execute you.  I will have additional instructions for you when you reach Liberty Island.
3696/0:That's the impression I get.
3697/0:Everything has a reason.
3698/0:Can you forgive them?
3699/0:Don't mention it.
3700/0:Who knows how far a new biomod architecture could go?  What if mental illness and manic emotional states could be eliminated?  Violent crime might disappear on its own accord.  The dangers of a vast police apparatus might become a thing of the past.
3701/0:There is no doubt now.  You are the complete solution, Alex.  The Helios core -- and the parts of JC's mind locked inside it -- have nearly recovered.
3702/0:
3702/1:
3703/0:Stay here and defend the area against your enemies.
3704/0:I don't want any trouble.  Let me just give you the credits.  [150]
3705/0:
3706/0:I already found their hideout and I took down that trader before he could say a word.
3707/0:I'd give my life savings if I thought somebody could eradicate the sect entirely.
3708/0:If you're ready to head out, just exit the area.  The unlock weapons scan will automatically reactivate everything.
3709/0:Some of us still worship the old gods, despite everything that's happened.
3710/0:Clever girl... What's the matter?  Don't like talking politics?
3711/0:You know my name.
3712/0:What if I'd rather work alone?
3713/0:Mr. O'Rourke is busy.
3714/0:Great.  Pass on my thanks.
3715/0:
3716/0:
3717/0:You're confident you can deploy your biomod weapon worldwide?
3718/0:Cool.  Just give me the word.
3719/0:Then what are you going to do?
3720/0:Nothing that happens here leaves this room.  Nothing.
3721/0:The church won't turn me away, though -- will they?
3722/0:What ABOUT him?
3723/0:The intellectual property has been secured and will be analyzed by our experts.  Well done.  We will have another mission for you as soon as you learn where Dr. Nassif went.  Look for clues in the biolab on the second floor.  Those nanomanipulators in the Minister of Culture's penthouse were headed for a scientist there -- probably an ApostleCorp sleeper agent.
3724/0:They've got to be stopped.  Their main objective was to capture Paul Denton from Apostlecorp's lab here in the arcology, which they succeeded in doing.  We have intel that he's being held in Flight Bay 24.
3725/0:One of the kids probably let it out for kicks.
3726/0:All right.  Let's go!
3727/0:I'll bet that the shipment hasn't even left Germany.
3728/0:Well, all right.  I'll give you a few seconds to take cover once you leave the locker room, then I'll try to draw the Seeker's fire.  Just keep your head down.  You never know what's gonna happen when the shooting starts.
3729/0:Yes, you demand authenticity from everything you do, and coffee is no exception.
3730/0:I met your manager.  Nice lady.
3731/0:Helios will communicate, not assimilate.  Life will go on as usual.
3732/0:I came here hoping to relax.
3733/0:Thank Heaven for the Church.
3734/0:Dumier has declared you an ally.
3735/0:How about that.  Well, it would be best for me not to know your business with Mr. O'Rourke, but let me give you the bounty I had put on his head.  I am also prepared to extend to you a membership to the VIP club.
3736/0:That bad?
3737/0:
3737/1:
3737/2:
3737/3:
3737/4:
3738/0:Good, you found the molecular spec for the counter-nanite.  Now put an end to the Chairman's scheme by reprogramming the nanoformer bots to synthesize the cure.  The bot kennels are near the exterior on Level 107.
3739/0:Your children could be their next customers, installing illegal and immoral biomods, ruining their bodies at an early age.
3740/0:It's not that complicated.
3741/0:Yeah, sure, they're cute when they're little...
3742/0:Damn, guess I blew it...
3743/0:(grunt) Lucky shot!
3743/1:Ow!  Just wait till it's YOUR turn...
3744/0:(grunt) The flames!
3744/1:(grunt) Water!
3745/0:(grunt) Everything's going black.
3745/1:(grunt) I feel dizzy.
3746/0:Special kill bonuses for SSC have been approved for this target.
3747/0:(grunt) I can't see!
3747/1:Ungh -- that stings!  I'm blinded!
3748/0:Vitakka... vitakka... vitakka....
3749/0:(grunt) It'll take more than that.
3750/0:At last, Order has triumphed.
3751/0:(grunt) I don't know how much more of this I can take.
3751/1:(groan)
3752/0:(grunt)
3752/1:(groan)
3753/0:Oof...
3753/1:Ouch!
3753/2:(grunt)
3753/3:Ugh.
3754/0:...new consciousness...
3754/1:I go now to a better place...
3755/0:I will reimburse you.  Perhaps in a few weeks when the shop's cash reserves are replenished.
3756/0:They'll probably have me inspecting cargo tomorrow.
3757/0:I am preparing to meet you in Flight Bay 23, but the pilot beacon seems to be offline.  You will need to activate it before I can land.
3758/0:At least they haven't tried to suck out my brains and laminate my body with black Latex.
3759/0:Too bad for the Claw.
3760/0:The purpose of the raid is now clear -- the Templars have taken our leader hostage.  They seem to be maintaining life support, but for how long?  We were supposed to protect him and awaken him once we found the cure.  How could we let this happen?
3761/0:Whoa -- Hey!  This is my apartment.
3762/0:
3762/1:
3762/2:
3763/0:Promptly, I assume.
3764/0:May Her Holiness watch over you.
3765/0:EMP grenades are useful, but I don't have the credits. [200]
3766/0:We have prepared the way so that you may carry out the plans of the Illuminati.
3767/0:What are you going to do?
3768/0:
3769/0:It's -- I can hardly believe it!  He doesn't really work for the WTO!  The whole organization is a sham!
3770/0:(gasp)
3771/0:Direct hit!
3771/1:One more like that, and I've got you!
3771/2:You better believe it!
3771/3:That's right!
3772/0:I got him!
3772/1:Did ya like that, bub?
3773/0:I got her!
3773/1:Did ya like that, honey?
3774/0:That's what I'm talking about!
3774/1:How do you like that!
3775/0:I guess the Luminon was right.
3776/0:Her Holiness has protected me once more.
3776/1:At last, it's over...
3776/2:I only do what is necessary.
3776/3:I am sorry, but the Search required your end.
3776/4:May your spirit now find Order.
3776/5:May you find Order beyond this world.
3776/6:It is done.
3776/7:Time for cleanup.
3776/8:This one's cold.
3777/0:I hope Mathers is okay.  We need his help to activate the repair bot, but if he comes through that cloud, it might kill him.
3778/0:May your spirit find Order, now that I have freed your lost soul.
3778/1:I wish it wouldn't have come to this... but I did what I had to do.
3779/0:Her Holiness was clearly watching over us.
3779/1:We have halted chaos once more.
3780/0:Don't worry, there's more where that came from.
3780/1:Argh!  I can't connect!
3781/0:We should be back to normal operations shortly.
3782/0:Apartment?  Oh, that one.  Already leased.  Sorry.
3783/0:
3784/0:... just disappeared.
3784/1:My shot's obstructed...
3784/2:Gotta find another angle... this one isn't working.
3784/3:Can't have gone far.
3784/4:Do what you will.  Patience is one of my virtues.
3784/5:It's only a matter of time...
3785/0:
3786/0:Each person's true potential will be able to shine through now, no longer burdened by physical limitations.
3787/0:Full payment is necessary before the exchange.
3788/0:That's right... I've been meaning to tell you -- Good work on the interrogation of Dr. Nassif in Cairo.  My scientists just laughed at me when I said ApostleCorp had developed teleportation, but I appreciate the advance warning.  I had my staff procure this extra biomod canister so that you might be a more effective operative.
3789/0:I guess politics don't matter much down here, where it's us against the mutants.
3790/0:Let's just say I have a few tricks up my sleeve -- kinda like you do.
3791/0:How many times do you have to be told not to worry about what happens in other departments?
3792/0:... don't have to tell ME...
3792/1:On it.
3792/2:Right.
3793/0:Sure thing, bro'.
3794/0:Where did he go?
3794/1:He won't get far...
3795/0:Where did she go?
3795/1:She won't get far...
3796/0:Hey -- I'm running.
3797/0:I need some firepower.  Give me the SMG.  [800]
3798/0:For you? No charge.  I'm waiting to pick up a passenger, but for now I'm open and feeling generous.
3799/0:No loitering.  Move along now.
3800/0:What a coward!
3800/1:Oh yeah, it's time for you to get out of Dodge.
3801/0:Enemy trying to escape.
3801/1:We've got a target taking flight.
3802/0:Ha!  Look at him run!
3802/1:Now we see what he's really made of.
3803/0:Ha!  Look at her run!
3803/1:Now we see what she's really made of.
3804/0:I just hope we can find a way to salvage this summit and get the two sides talking again.
3805/0:What ABOUT him?
3806/0:I can't wait to file this report.  
3807/0:Make it quick.  Gob-zilla's on deck.
3808/0:Sure thing, girl.
3809/0:(clears throat) ... somethin' in the air...
3809/1:Uh-huh.  That's right.
3809/2:... just gob-bait, sittin' here like this...
3809/3:Well, I NEVER...
3810/0:(sigh)
3810/1:(grumble)
3810/2:(cough)
3810/3:(hum NG song) // or whatever
3811/0:Sid Black.  Call me Sid.  Best jet-jockey in the Northern Hemisphere.  So you're on your own?  If you need a lift, I'm game.  All you've got to do is bail out my jet and give me a little something for my trouble.
3812/0:Hey, two's a crowd.
3812/1:Watch where you're goin'.
3813/0:(grunt) I'm one of you!
3813/1:(grunt) Real smooth, spaz.
3814/0:What?!  // exasperated
3814/1:Don't have anything better to do?
3814/2:Like what you see?
3815/0:Better watch it.
3815/1:You're gonna get yourself in trouble.
3816/0:Doctrinal demands.  You must renounce all body-modification, nanotech, genetic, cybernetic -- everything.  And you must be ready to destroy the transgressors.
3817/0:Somethin' wrong, dude?
3818/0:Somethin' wrong, hon?
3819/0:Beat it.
3819/1:Stop, turn around, and walk away.  Got it?
3820/0:I'll take the gas grenades. [300]
3821/0:You can't hit me!
3821/1:Order protects me.
3822/0:Please remember to clean the toaster oven in the facility kitchen when you are finished using it.
3823/0:Blasted mods...
3823/1:The target's modified.  Great.
3824/0:Must be cloaking...
3825/0:Grenades and missiles aren't going to get the job done here.
3826/0:This freak's got a skull gun.
3827/0:Whoa.  Enemy's equipped with a speed mod.
3828/0:The mechs may not be able to see you, but I can.
3829/0:Our colony is strengthened in number from your rescue.
3830/0:Got a casualty here.
3830/1:No!  Look out -- this one's got some bite.
3831/0:I've got to show that thing what happens when you mess with the Order.
3832/0:You may have a few pieces, but I doubt you can see the whole picture.
3833/0:May your spirit now find true Order, friend.
3833/1:Another loss... when will this end?
3834/0:Almost got a break tonight.  Supposedly someone tried to murder the Champ.
3835/0:Be careful.
3836/0:Yes.  We have rescued you so that you can help us identify and defeat your creators.  Please listen to my High Augur, Lin May Chen.  She will contact you at the holocomm in the other room.
3837/0:Got somethin' to prove?
3837/1:Yo, put that away.
3838/0:Okay, that's enough.
3839/0:One of the guards turned up dead.
3840/0:You're askin' for trouble, dude.
3841/0:You're askin' for trouble, sis'.
3842/0:Don't touch me, scab.
3842/1:Better quit pushin'.  I mean it.
3843/0:You've just got to use your head sometimes.
3844/0:(grunt) Now you're makin' me mad.
3844/1:(grunt) Jesus -- you hit me!
3845/0:You messin' with me?  Is that it?
3845/1:I'm about sick of you makin' bug-eyes at me.
3846/0:You better cut that out.
3846/1:I'm warnin' you...
3847/0:Read my lips: goodbye.
3847/1:I'm tellin' you to leave.
3848/0:You got a beef with me, I got a beef with you.
3848/1:You better not set me off.
3849/0:What's it do -- trip an alarm?
3850/0:How 'bout it?  Two Sunfires, double the damage.
3851/0:Oh no!  We've lost a Seeker!
3852/0:Because that is how things really get done -- country club, penthouse suite, bedroom...
3853/0:Oh no!  That beast killed a Seeker!
3854/0:Her Holiness guides your hand.
3854/1:Score one for the Seekers.
3855/0:Nice work.  Target neutralized.
3855/1:Finally, someone put an end to this one.
3856/0:Leo?  Is that you?  The frogsuit threw me for a second.
3857/0:Hey!  Coward!
3857/1:Get back here!
3858/0:Clearly no match for a Seeker.
3858/1:Soon, another Order victory.
3859/0:Not a challenge for the likes of us.
3860/0:When will they learn, eh?
3861/0:He's done for.
3862/0:I wonder where they really are....
3863/0:Hey, I remember you.  We met in the vents at Tarsus, and you're the one who took care of Archer.  I owe you my life.
3864/0:She's done for.
3865/0:Okay.  You're clear to enter.
3866/0:The drop site is the Black Gate Ruins, west tower, top floor.  In an unmarked silver footlocker.
3867/0:Hold on.  I'll be right back.
3868/0:Sounds like typical R and D -- an innovation that would expand the biomod market.
3869/0:We're not exactly sure what went wrong, but there are some radical cells within the Order that want to take more extreme measures.  They certainly don't represent the Order as a whole.  
3870/0:How so?
3871/0:I'd like to know why I keep givin' you second chances.
3871/1:I've just about had it.
3872/0:I'm serious, man.  Better stand down.
3873/0:I'm serious, hon.  Better stand down.
3874/0:Fine.  Don't listen.  See what I do.
3874/1:Guess you're pickin' a fight.  I'm startin' to like the idea...
3875/0:I get it.  Tryin' to see if I'd crack.  Well -- I'm still here.
3876/0:That freaked me out, man.
3877/0:Always "drop my birds on the curb," eh?  You can't beat the life in New Cairo.  I even had cash this time when I ran into a certain creditor of mine in the elevator.
3878/0:That freaked me out, sis'.
3879/0:Not now!
3879/1:Just let me take care of this!
3880/0:You architectures are impressive, state-of-the-art.
3881/0:Oops.
3881/1:Feebed THAT up.
3882/0:Can't get it open!
3883/0:At last, my scientists succeeded.  You are the complete solution.  My brother, Paul, was to be upgraded first so that he could carry the infusions through the Gate, but there was a setback.
3884/0:
3885/0:
3885/1:
3885/2:
3885/3:
3885/4:
3886/0:
3887/0:Just one more...  just one more...
3887/1:Her Holiness, guide me to victory...
3888/0:You're in the game, D.  Now get in there and shake your pom-poms for the Claw.  He'll be comin' out the south chute!
3889/0:
3890/0:We've got to get him.
3891/0:
3892/0:We've got to get her.
3893/0:Oh no...  
3893/1:All is lost...
3894/0:We can't let him slaughter us like this!
3895/0:We can't let her slaughter us like this!
3896/0:I have a lot of fans at Tarsus!  I hope they come to my concert tomorrow...
3897/0:What is wrong with you?!  //blaming
3897/1:I can't take it anymore!  I can't take it!
3898/0:We just need a foothold in the enclaves.  Once they get a taste of all-natural coffee, they will never go back.
3899/0:Yeah?
3900/0:
3900/1:
3900/2:
3900/3:
3901/0:Hmph.  Terrorists.
3902/0:
3903/0:You killed him?
3904/0:Sure, take out the Templars.  [1000]
3905/0:The Guardian grows weary.  She no longer believes in the Republic.
3906/0:What sponsor?  I came across a reference to an ApostleCorp.  Is that the company I'm supposed to work for?
3907/0:
3907/1:
3908/0:There's gotta be a way around.
3908/1:Hm.  Something in the way.
3909/0:No thanks.
3910/0:You sure you locked up?
3911/0:(grunt)
3911/1:(grunt) Here I come...
3912/0:No one informed me of such an occurrence.  You should assume that the concert started on schedule.  Hurry!  Tickets are 200 credits at the door.
3913/0:Nuh-uh.  I'm stayin' right here.
3913/1:I'm not STUPID.  
3914/0:... gettin' help!
3914/1:Be right back with some reinforcements...
3915/0:You mean.... all of this, my business, the competition with Pequod's... it's all some sort of fabrication...?
3916/0:Dammit!  Gotta drop back.
3916/1:All yours, killer.
3917/0:Save your ass, man!
3918/0:Save your ass, girl!
3919/0:
3920/0:Hol' up.  Somethin's there.
3921/0:Talk.
3921/1:Just tell me where and get out of the way.
3922/0:
3923/0:
3924/0:I need backup!
3925/0:We could use some help!
3926/0:Here I come.
3926/1:Got it.
3927/0:Okay.  You know where to find me if you change your mind.
3928/0:Phassa... Phassa... Phassa... 
3928/1:Vedan... Vedan... Vedan... 
3928/2:Thank Her Holiness.
3928/3:I must work on my meditations.
3928/4:My mind is clouded.
3928/5:The Search is long, but worth it.
3928/6:I'm a bit hungry.
3928/7:I need some rest.
3928/8:I think it's time for a new robe.
3928/9:If only I could achieve the next level....
3928/10:A Seeker must always be patient.
3928/11:I hope she soon sees the light.
3928/12:Tch!  Look at that... almost worn through.
3928/13:Why does no one clean up around here?
3928/14:About time for a prayer break...
3928/15:So much to learn...
3928/16:What a fool I used to be.
3928/17:Not all of the Church's work can be uplifting, I suppose.
3929/0:... I wish I wasn't stuck inside today.
3930/0:Soon every human will return to what he or she was meant to be.
3931/0:Beautiful weather. 
3932/0:Time to go.
3933/0:Rain, rain, go away...
3934/0:It's freezing.
3935/0:
3935/1:
3935/2:
3935/3:
3935/4:
3936/0:
3937/0:Oh yeah?
3938/0:Ach -- have you ever seen such a mess?
3939/0:Where?
3940/0:What sponsor?  I came across a reference to an ApostleCorp.  Is that the company I'm supposed to work for?
3941/0:We are pleased to serve, especially when so generously compensated.
3942/0:This obsession with other people's business is so juvenile.
3943/0:Hi.  I'm NG Resonance.  What would you like to talk about?
3944/0:Dr. Vlimek, my commanders were quite pleased with the last data sets you've sent us.  We did, however, have some questions about the retrofitting on some of the sensors.  Let's schedule a time to meet about this.
3945/0:See someone come through here?
3946/0:I'm lookin' for a guy.  A killer.  See anything?
3947/0:Thanks.  I guess my eyes gave me away...
3948/0:I'm lookin' for this chick.  A killer.  See anything?
3949/0:"Tarsus continues to offer the best educational opportunities, even in this time of uncertainty." -- It was in the memo.  You DID read the whole memo, before racing down here, didn't you?
3950/0:Damn, which way?
3951/0:Order be praised, my Eeva is safe.  How do I repay you?  Here -- no arguing -- take a reward.  Money means nothing to me anymore.
3952/0:Can you help me out?  I'm following somebody.
3953/0:Ah, Alex D.  Nice work resolving that situation in the Galleria.  The WTO appreciates your help keeping the peace in our enclave.  And Chief Morgan has had a lot to say about you.
3954/0:I caught some scab sneakin' around.  Where'd he go?
3955/0:I caught some scab sneakin' around.  Where'd she go?
3956/0:What's this all about?
3956/1:Weird.  Somethin' about to go down?
3957/0:Did you see that?
3958/0:Hear that?
3959/0:Money is not the supreme reward or motivator.  
3960/0:... sha la la la ...
3960/1:... onward Order soldiers ...
3960/2:(yawn)
3960/3:(cough)
3961/0:That's very generous.  What's the Omar's objective?  Space exploration?  What was that thing in the basement?
3962/0:I know I'm supposed to love all creatures as part of the grand order, but even the rats...?
3963/0:Strange... this building stands on the site of the Porta Negra, or Black Gate, the ruins of the old city wall from Roman times.  About all we know is that the facility underground is not a museum.  You'll need to discover the security code to the elevator before you'll be able to investigate it for us.  Try the Nine Worlds Tavern in central Trier -- maybe one of the locals knows something about this place.
3964/0:
3965/0:I'd have to think about it.
3966/0:Eh?  Yeah, this job is for the birds.  heh heh...
3967/0:Too dangerous to stop to talk.
3967/1:Now is not a good time for a chat. //sarcastic
3968/0:Just who do you think you are?
3968/1:Back off.
3968/2:What's your problem?
3969/0:Pay attention to where you're going!
3969/1:Get out of my face.
3969/2:Oof!
3970/0:I can't believe the galleria's at the mercy of their own security systems.
3971/0:Watch it!  That hurt!
3971/1:Hey!  You don't want to start something with me.
3972/0:Please stop looking at me like that.  // sarcastically
3972/1:Stop staring at me.
3972/2:Yes?  What is it?
3972/3:Move along.
3973/0:
3974/0:Hurry!  You're missing the fight!
3975/0:Are you feeling okay?
3975/1:Very funny.
3975/2:Settle down there.
3975/3:Don't get cute.
3976/0:What for?  You a spy?
3977/0:Just take a look outside.  It's nanite dust these people breathe -- from Nanite Swell 11.  Particles like little insects -- unaffected by the wind.  Probably a leak from a pre-Collapse laboratory that's been forgotten for two decades.
3978/0:I think I'm getting better.
3979/0:I'm ready.  Let's go.
3980/0:Funny.  These Knights Templar hate the idea of machines in your body to fight disease, but they don't mind having machines fight their wars.
3981/0:Is this a prank call or something?  Funny way to meet people.
3982/0:Did you see what caused that shadow?
3983/0:Hey, did someone close the door?
3984/0:Uh-huh.
3985/0:Hey, did someone open the door?
3986/0:What the hell happened to the door?  Any idea?
3987/0:Unifying the world's religions is a difficult enterprise.  What we must do -- and I ask your help in this -- is determine what happened to Captain Lamar so that we can assess the operation.  Just as you arrived I got a report that he abandoned his unit.
3988/0:Know who put that there?
3989/0:I'm sure you've already made a good first impression on Dr. Nassif.
3990/0:What do you need?
3991/0:Know where it went?
3992/0:Real pretty.  Who messed with it?
3993/0:Guess I'll find my pilot and consider your request.
3994/0:I'm sorry about your tragedy.
3995/0:It's goin' haywire!  What's the deal?
3996/0:The price on those prox mines is too steep for me. [300]
3997/0:It's down.  What's the deal?
3998/0:It's all busted up.  Hey -- what's the deal?
3999/0:I don't think you're prepared to back up that threat.
3999/1:You should reconsider that.
4000/0:Loitering is prohibited.
4000/1:I don't think you're in the right place.
4001/0:I think you need to move along.
4001/1:Ok, ok, enough of that already.
4001/2:Nothing to see here.  Move along.
4002/0:All clear.  You could make it to the medina if you leave right now.
4003/0:Back off.
4003/1:That's enough.
4003/2:Back off!
4003/3:Watch where you're going.  I'm a Seeker, for heaven's sake!
4004/0:Anything I can do to help?
4005/0:That's not funny!
4005/1:I'm beginning to think that wasn't an accident.
4006/0:Just relax.  You look like you could use some down-time.
4007/0:You're not going to intimidate me.
4007/1:Go find someone else for a staring contest.
4007/2:(a challenge) Can I HELP you?
4007/3:Enough staring.  You're disrupting my thoughts.
4008/0:You are not amusing.
4008/1:This is wearing on my nerves.
4008/2:Enjoying yourself?
4009/0:I assure you, this is a bad idea.
4009/1:This is a serious offense.
4010/0:You are not permitted to be here.  Move along.
4010/1:You don't have access to this area.  Get lost.
4011/0:I thought the Order was a spiritual movement.
4012/0:Move it!  Now!
4012/1:Get outta here.
4012/2:You're really trying my patience.
4013/0:At least we don't have to worry about Plague 11.  It's going to be such a relief to get outside.
4014/0:This is great!  Drop you in town, and me and this girl I know up there -- Cindy, I think -- get to have a holiday.
4015/0:I'm just one man....  I -- I --
4016/0:For Cairo?
4017/0:I like Bud.  He's one of my biggest fans.
4018/0:Hey!  Did someone throw that?
4019/0:All right.  I'm ready.
4020/0:How'd that get turned on?
4021/0:How'd that get turned off?
4022/0:What's the deal?  Somebody just open this?
4023/0:What's the deal?  Somebody just shut this?
4024/0:This is no drill.  The facility is under attack.  Alex, please get the medkit and multitools from your equipment locker next to the basketball court -- just a precaution.  I'm transmitting the softkey ID to your datavault right now....  More details when they become available.
4025/0:Who turned on the light?
4026/0:Ma'am.
4027/0:Good work.  Now I've got to get the troops ready for the transport.
4028/0:Who turned off the light?
4029/0:Good seeing you.
4029/1:Yes.  Hello.
4030/0:Whatever you say -- I owe ya.
4031/0:What's the deal?  Think a person caused that?
4032/0:Carry on.
4033/0:See the feeb who started the fire?
4034/0:No problem.  I'll keep a safe distance for now.  When you want to leave, contact me with this beacon.
4035/0:What's up with the smoke?
4036/0:Officer.
4036/1:Sleeper shift.
4036/2:Hey.
4037/0:It's pretty exciting being a part of history.  Maybe that had some of us distracted earlier.
4038/0:How's it goin'?
4038/1:Back atcha.
4038/2:Wake me up when there's a crime.
4039/0:This is your last chance!
4039/1:You're about to push me too far!
4039/2:Once more, and you're really going to regret it.
4040/0:Shoulda brought a book.
4040/1:They have me working another double.
4040/2:They drag you into some endless investigation every time you cap a beggar.
4040/3:If it's mandatory training, we should get paid.
4041/0:You just need to cool it.  Sheesh!
4041/1:Are you quite finished with that nonsense?!
4041/2:I hope you're done showing off.
4042/0:I hear ya.
4042/1:Tell me about it.
4042/2:Lord knows we deserve better.
4043/0:There is no doubt now.  You are the complete solution, Alex.  The Helios core -- and the parts of JC's mind locked inside it -- have nearly recovered.
4044/0:At least we get paid on time.
4044/1:We'll come out of this with some marketable skills, though.
4044/2:The WTO has a good health plan, though.
4044/3:But I'll get by.  The rotations even out.
4045/0:I'm on my way to get backup.
4045/1:I'm going to get us some support.
4046/0:Yeah, right.
4046/1:Wish I could be so positive.
4046/2:Speak for yourself.
4047/0:Enough of this noise...
4047/1:Aaaaaaiiieee!
4047/2:Oh god...
4047/3:I can't handle this...
4048/0:Shhh.  I think someone's there.
4048/1:Better wait 'til we're sure we're alone.
4049/0:When you go to Antarctica and find JC, remember what hangs in the balance.  I haven't told you just how powerful JC has become.
4050/0:Guess that would pay better than these medina scabs.  I offer to save their lives, and the best they can do is 12 credits.  How about you make a reasonable offer, and we get out of this hole.
4051/0:Grenade!
4052/0:Hang on there, sport.
4053/0:Better hold up -- there's a mine.
4054/0:I've been fighting a trespasser.  Did anyone come through here?
4055/0:I never thought this hideout would become so important.
4056/0:Seen anyone suspicious?  
4056/1:I'm after someone -- did you see anyone come this way?
4057/0:The truth...?
4058/0:No....!  NO!  The Illuminati are destroying the Helios core!  Satisfied, Alex?  I'm mortal like you again.  Helios won't be able to save me this time, but I don't plan to be the one who needs saving.  You want to  hand the earth over to plutocrats...?  Come and take it from me.  I have reclaimed the Statue of Liberty for all of humanity.
4059/0:(coughs)  Pretty thick today, isn't it?
4060/0:Your enemies have occupied the island.
4061/0:Huh?
4061/1:Eh?
4061/2:Oh?
4062/0:Alex, you understand that my machine taps into MJ-12's old network.  The right thing to do is make this network available, equally, to everyone on the planet.  I hope you will reconsider your allegiance to the conspirators who rode the last great civilization into the ground.
4063/0:I neutralized the Omar population in the medina.  You can relax.
4064/0:Know where the blood came from?
4065/0:Someone been fightin'?
4066/0:Don't look at me.  Try that way.
4066/1:Right over there.
4067/0:Who is the woman?
4068/0:Mighta seen something.  I don't know.  Try over there.
4069/0:Hmmm...
4069/1:Eh?
4069/2:What's that?
4070/0:Some enclave feeb.  Went thataway.
4071/0:Hmmm...
4071/1:Eh?
4071/2:What's that?
4072/0:He's over there.
4073/0:She's over there.
4074/0:Hmmm...
4074/1:Eh?
4074/2:What's that?
4075/0:Haearin' somethin' weird over there.
4076/0:Come again?
4077/0:Scab jumped me!  He went that way.
4078/0:If it was up to them, this place would never turn a profit.
4079/0:I heard our guys just walked right in there... some sort of corporate lab in the arcology, right?  It wasn't much of a "capture" since he's just a block of ice.
4080/0:Come again?
4081/0:You used to live at the cathedral?
4082/0:Come again?
4083/0:Out of the corner of my eye...?
4084/0:No, that's going too far.  I just poke around when they're not home.  There's a master code for all the apartment doors.  For the penthouse though, you need the key to the back door since the elevator's out again.  Since my salary is a joke, both are for sale, if you're interested.
4085/0:Out of the corner of my eye...?
4086/0:Hey there!  I haven't seen you around here before.
4087/0:Out of the corner of my eye...?
4088/0:I wonder what's making that noise.
4089/0:Go on now.   You have your orders.
4090/0:That's the man whose penthouse you broke into -- Upper Seattle's Minister of Culture.  Not much use talking to him at this point -- you already have access to his place.
4091/0:
4092/0:This is the main control room where you will install the Sequencing Module once the power is restored.
4093/0:
4094/0:
4095/0:Once again, good work in Seattle.  The WTO is making good use of the data.  Your next objective: destroy the Nassif family's greenhouse in the village.  Exit through the mosque on Level 108, then go west.  The experimental greenhouse, a violation of WTO regulations, should lead us to Dr. Nassif.
4096/0:I really must concentrate on my book now.
4097/0:I'm not anybody's pet project.
4098/0:Helios and I are one consciousness.  No distinction is possible.
4099/0:All available security to the main entrance.
4100/0:If you're half the operative Leo is, you'll go for it.
4101/0:I'd put down some money to see NG promote Pequod's.  [500 credits.]
4102/0:Wake up down there!  Come on!
4103/0:Good work.
4104/0:Finally, we don't have to cower before monolithic governments.  The Collapse has set us free.
4105/0:Come on.  We gotta get moving.
4106/0:
4107/0:I wonder what's making that noise.
4108/0:What for?
4109/0:I wonder what's making that noise.
4110/0:Do not betray the trust of the Illuminati.
4111/0:Again?  Hmmm...
4111/1:More of the same?
4111/2:There it goes again.
4112/0:Again?  Hmmm...
4112/1:More of the same?
4112/2:There it goes again.
4113/0:You're starting to make me nervous, lady.
4114/0:Again?  Hmmm...
4114/1:More of the same?
4114/2:There it goes again.
4115/0:Something may be going on there. 
4115/1:That's strange...
4115/2:I can't really tell, but...
4116/0:Something may be going on there. 
4116/1:That's strange...
4116/2:I can't really tell, but...
4117/0:I can't believe you let someone lead you on like this.  Who was it?  I'll straighten them out for you.
4118/0:Something may be going on there. 
4118/1:That's strange...
4118/2:I can't really tell, but...
4119/0:The Order and WTO have maintained a fragile peace over the last two decades as they've pursued parallel strategies for rebuilding global government after the Collapse.
4120/0:That they hope to get from us.
4121/0:I have a bad feeling about this.
4122/0:I have a bad feeling about this.
4123/0:May you find what you seek.
4124/0:Universal biomodification.  Doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, does it?  Hardly a political ideal.  Don't be fooled by JC Denton's rhetoric.  He is the mouthpiece for an AI construct, just like an Omar, just like your old classmate Leo.
4125/0:You just ensured your own extinction.  Or do you know something I don't?
4126/0:Don't get to thinking this could be a full-time gig.  Mr. O'Rourke doesn't keep assassins on the payroll.
4127/0:You will appreciate our merchandise.  You may purchase now or earn a discount by providing a service to the Omar.
4128/0:Miss Sak's in the office by the landing pad... so that she can keep an eye on her property.
4129/0:I've got a score to settle with the Minister of Culture over there at the bar.  He stole my design for the sculpture in the Galleria.  So now I'm broke, my WTO dues are up, and I might get deported to Lower Seattle.
4130/0:Sorry, I --
4131/0:I do not understand why you insist on following the WTO's greed and self-interest.  Think about all the people that will be endangered now that they have the schematics for this weapon.  May Her Holiness help you find a way out of the WTO's snare.
4132/0:I guess you could say that.  What about you, have you been with the organization long?
4133/0:Enough talking.  I have much to think about.
4134/0:Chief Morgan doesn't like to be kept waiting.
4135/0:I am grateful for your forebearance, after I failed to kill the test subjects and Dr. Nassif.
4136/0:
4137/0:I have a bad feeling about this.
4138/0:Oh no!
4138/1:This is serious.
4139/0:Oh no!
4139/1:This is serious.
4140/0:Oh no!
4140/1:This is serious.
4141/0:Security around here is falling apart.
4141/1:I'm going to settle this right now.
4142/0:You can instantly interrupt the function of an assailant's nervous system, rendering him immobile - but without terminating him, releasing you from any untidy liabilities, just in case your trigger finger was a little itchy.
4143/0:Security around here is falling apart.
4143/1:I'm going to settle this right now.
4144/0:Security around here is falling apart.
4144/1:I'm going to settle this right now.
4145/0:
4145/1:
4145/2:
4145/3:
4145/4:
4145/5:
4145/6:
4145/7:
4146/0:Hey!
4146/1:Oh no!
4146/2:Whoa!
4147/0:Make up your mind.
4148/0:Hey!
4148/1:Oh no!
4148/2:Whoa!
4149/0:One thing I can't stand is one human being who hates another human being.  Know what I mean?
4150/0:Hey!
4150/1:Oh no!
4150/2:Whoa!
4151/0:Ma'am, that's close enough.  Do not approach the checkpoint.
4152/0:Tough luck, D.  The Pit appreciates the business, though.
4153/0:Thank God, she's all right.  Thanks for taking down enough of those Templar outlaws to make it easy for my people to move in.  Now let's follow up on what Her Holiness learned about Luminon Saman.  Go to the tavern and hire a pilot.  If you wouild like a map of Saman's compound, report to the SSC Station on your way across town.
4154/0:I didn't ask for your help.
4155/0:We've had three nightclubs on that spot in less than a year.  Fronts!  All of them!
4156/0:They'll have to replace the entire inventory.  You won't have to worry about retaliation from the manager, either.  He's out of commission.
4157/0:I think these Templars are itchin' for a war.
4158/0:Unless Sid Black sent you to pay his debt -- or you want to bring me his head -- you better let one of my security guards escort you out.
4159/0:I guess that's over with.
4159/1:Don't need to worry about that any more.
4160/0:I guess that's over with.
4160/1:Don't need to worry about that any more.
4161/0:Interesting.  Thanks for the tip.
4162/0:I guess that's over with.
4162/1:Don't need to worry about that any more.
4163/0:You wrecked my equipment!  Get out!
4164/0:Security must've caught whoever was poking around.
4165/0:Security must've caught whoever was poking around.
4166/0:Security must've caught whoever was poking around.
4167/0:Phew!  Looks like I don't have to worry about that thug anymore.
4168/0:Phew!  Looks like I don't have to worry about that thug anymore.
4169/0:I came here to kill you.
4170/0:Phew!  Looks like I don't have to worry about that thug anymore.
4171/0:Who would attack a school?
4172/0:Phew!  What a relief!  The killer's gone.
4173/0:I just kept one of your fellow Seekers from getting killed by a couple of thugs.
4174/0:Thanks.  Just what I wanted to hear.
4175/0:What's wrong?
4176/0:I could use your help with the Illuminati commandos guarding the south dock.
4177/0:... processing modules... nanite-capsid upgrade... go...
4178/0:Wish I had the buy-in money, but I don't.  [100 credits]
4179/0:You stay here.  I'll take care of it.
4180/0:
4180/1:
4180/2:
4180/3:
4181/0:No.  You listen.  The truth is in the Word, the old writings, the meditations on the 52 cetasikas.  Saman says only this, and I agree.  The truth is not in secret deals with bankers and factory owners.
4182/0:How'd you get past the Templar defenses?
4183/0:Well, I've turned your heart just in time.  Now...  Wait!  Must be an overload... or a self-destruct sequence.  A blast door just sealed off the only exit.  You'll be trapped unless you can kill the power with the control box on the south wall -- or destroy the exposed conduits.  I guess the technician who worked here was a little paranoid about hackers.
4184/0:You don't want all the details in one dose -- trust me.  First pick up your map to the facility.  It's stored in a datacube inside the chest.  Then I'll unlock your door and tell you what I can about the disaster.
4185/0:Excellent.  My technicians on Ophelia are already configuring the first operational Aquinas Hub in a generation... one which is in orbit and safe from tampering.  Now make sure that both Denton brothers are neutralized.
4186/0:My brother arrived safely.  Thank you again.
4187/0:Phew!  What a relief!  The killer's gone.
4188/0:I am watching from a spy satellite, Alex.  I am an Omar now.  It is good.  I saw one of the leaders go down.  They are weak and made of flesh.  Forget their schemes.  Wipe them all out and destroy the machine JC Denton built inside the Statue.
4189/0:I hope you're right.
4190/0:Phew!  What a relief!  The killer's gone.
4191/0:This raid is just a probing action.  The Order wants to find out what we're working on.
4192/0:I guess that thief decided to move on.
4193/0:I guess that thief decided to move on.
4194/0:I guess that thief decided to move on.
4195/0:I wonder what frightened it.
4196/0:... reading through their mail... heh heh... lots of complaints...
4197/0:The judgment of our leaders is never impaired.  Next rev of Dentons lacks apparent flaws of its predecessors.
4198/0:I wonder what frightened it.
4199/0:I wonder what frightened it.
4200/0:Poor cat.
4201/0:Poor cat.
4202/0:I don't know about you, Edward, but I'm starting to get concerned.  We've lost contact with the other bases and with headquarters.  I think something terrible must've happened to the net, or maybe even to the world...  
4203/0:Saman, everything's going according to plan.  Preliminary tests indicate that the gate should transport me to JC's hideout.  We've also isolated a keystone piece that will easily disable the gate without permanently damaging it.  I'll be making the jump myself shortly, after which a detail of guards will be dispatched with the sequencing module to your compound.
4204/0:What do you want?  I'm busy.
4205/0:You can't get any info out of them.  They're just animals after all that modification.
4206/0:I don't take any satisfaction in killing.  He's done me a favor by dying prematurely.
4207/0:Then we agree to maintain a minimal threat profile until the crucial moment.
4208/0:All this scandal -- I love it!
4209/0:I'm ruined!
4210/0:Hey.
4210/1:How ya doin'?
4210/2:Nothing to see here.
4211/0:Poor cat.
4212/0:Ew.  Dead cat.  Full of diseases...
4213/0:Ew.  Dead cat.  Full of diseases...
4214/0:Ew.  Dead cat.  Full of diseases...
4215/0:Wait... that bot's coming for ME!
4215/1:What's it doing?  Oh my -- oh my God!
4216/0:Something must've tried to pounce on that rat.
4217/0:You don't kill someone and get away with it!
4217/1:You're gonna pay for that...
4217/2:This is war! 
4218/0:Something must've tried to pounce on that rat.
4219/0:You could've notified them yourself.
4220/0:Something must've tried to pounce on that rat.
4221/0:Wonder what's been after that bird.
4222/0:
4223/0:Wonder what's been after that bird.
4224/0:Are you sure?  I haven't done so well at killing YOU...
4225/0:We work in secret only because it best serves our purpose.  
4226/0:Wonder what's been after that bird.
4227/0:Just hang in there, Bug.
4228/0:
4229/0:
4230/0:I appreciate your dedication to reaching the Order church in Lower Seattle, but walking through that cloud to activate the Inclinator now that it's powered up could contaminate your body for years to come.  You may want to reconsider your actions.
4231/0:Can't get on the train without a pass.
4232/0:I did.  He didn't get me any closer to finding Dr. Nassif, either.
4233/0:I'm freezing my ass off out here.  The Omar shut down my enviro-suit remotely.  One good thing about this freakish weather, though: it makes for sharp thermals.  Whatever's under UNATCO, we're not too late to keep them from finding it.
4234/0:I'll have to find a buyer for the jet.
4235/0:I don't know what's gotten into her.  She was once a calm and devoted Seeker, like myself.
4236/0:Just another conspiracy theory.  Does anyone have proof?
4237/0:I just suddenly woke up.  I was installing this range weapon-mod on my rifle, and it clicked -- I've been training my whole life to hunt and kill people.  Even ApostleCorp -- that's what they trained me to do.
4238/0:This constant haze is awful. 
4239/0:Uh -- not exactly.
4240/0:Meanwhile, people on the outside go hungry.
4241/0:What about the rest of the weapons?
4242/0:Whoa.  What happened to that bot?
4243/0:Whoa.  What happened to that bot?
4244/0:Whoa.  What happened to that bot?
4245/0:That's it?  One guy?
4245/1:Better him than me.
4246/0:That's right.  You already lost.
4246/1:Let's see what you got!
4247/0:That's it?  One woman?
4247/1:Better her than me.
4248/0:They shouldn't give us guns if they don't want us killin' people...
4249/0:Looks like a bad upgrade... Jesus!
4249/1:Damn it, bot -- I'm not the enemy!
4250/0:Why is that?
4251/0:...been messing with the lights...
4252/0:The WTO does some admirable work, but couldn't it lead to the same kind of overcentralization that made the world so vulnerable to the Collapse in the first place?
4253/0:Is it that serious?
4254/0:...been messing with the lights...
4255/0:...been messing with the lights...
4256/0:That should be on.
4257/0:If I wanted to be a detective, I wouldn't be working for the SSC.
4258/0:It's me.
4259/0:It does make me uneasy, finding out it's all a front... but I can also see what the Illuminati are trying to accomplish and why they must work in secret.  I'll probably continue publicly working for the WTO, but with a new awareness of it's true importance.
4260/0:The WTO?
4261/0:I can't stand being trapped like this.  I want to DO something.
4262/0:Read the field, then make your move.
4263/0:Unless the Templars have already convinced one of you to go through the Gate and murder JC.  Exactly.  At a minimum, they have a highly placed spy who has torn apart our organization, starting with Chicago.
4264/0:The WTO should crack down on these Templars.
4265/0:I just hope I can make enough cash before another Pequod's opens.
4266/0:Ni-i-i-i-ce.... Appreciate the hospitality, plumcake.
4267/0:You disagree with the way High Augur Chen is doing things?
4268/0:You're kind of an amateur with weapons, I guess.
4268/1:Nice try, beggar.
4269/0:Let's keep the familiarities to a minimum until we're sure you haven't been followed.  Agreed?
4270/0:You're kind of an amateur with weapons, I guess.
4270/1:Nice try, beggar.
4271/0:Well... as long as it works.
4272/0:Matter clip's always useful, but I can't afford it. [200]
4273/0:Draw the enemy off!
4273/1:I can take the heat.
4274/0:At last.  Time I can use to think about my own problems.
4275/0:Draw the enemy off!
4275/1:I can take the heat.
4276/0:That should be on.
4277/0:Guess I'm too quick for him.
4278/0:Sounds like you got mixed up with some bad people.
4279/0:That should be on.
4280/0:Guess I'm too quick for him.
4281/0:That should be off.
4282/0:Guess I'm too quick for her.
4283/0:Sure.  I've got your back.
4284/0:Careful walkin' around here at night.
4285/0:That should be off.
4286/0:Guess I'm too quick for her.
4287/0:Your SMGs.... Well ---
4288/0:That should be off.
4289/0:(grunt) Damn...
4289/1:(grunt) I'll be okay...
4290/0:Am I seeing things?
4290/1:Maybe I need to get a better look...
4291/0:(grunt) Damn...
4291/1:(grunt) I'll be okay...
4292/0:Am I seeing things?
4292/1:Maybe I need to get a better look...
4293/0:You should already know that Miss Klara Sparks' death was a blow to us.  We are now depending on YOU, Alex.  Only a Denton or one of the trainees can use the Gate.
4294/0:Am I seeing things?
4294/1:Maybe I need to get a better look...
4295/0:I know I saw something.
4295/1:Uh oh.  I saw that.
4296/0:I know I saw something.
4296/1:Uh oh.  I saw that.
4297/0:I took care of the security bot.  It's safe for you to make a run for the medina.
4298/0:You're starting to hurt my feelings.
4299/0:There is no more merchandise.
4300/0:Do you mind?  I was thinking.
4301/0:So far, so good.
4302/0:You should have acted quickly!
4303/0:I bet it IS a drill.  Some kind of test...
4304/0:Take the elevator to the ground level.  You and the others will be on your own in Seattle.  Just keep your heads down and I will contact you when Tarsus can arrange an extraction.
4305/0:Just a raid and a few haywire security systems -- no need to be paranoid, right?
4306/0:(grunt) You got me...
4306/1:(grunt) Oh, yeah...?
4307/0:(grunt) You got me...
4307/1:(grunt) Oh, yeah...?
4308/0:Ouch.
4309/0:Ouch.
4310/0:I know I saw something.
4310/1:Uh oh.  I saw that.
4311/0:(scream) Get it off me!
4312/0:Maybe I need to get my hearing checked...
4312/1:That sure did sound like something.
4313/0:(scream) Get it off me!
4314/0:
4314/1:
4314/2:
4314/3:
4314/4:
4315/0:Maybe I need to get my hearing checked...
4315/1:That sure did sound like something.
4316/0:(grunt) I think I'll be all right...
4317/0:Maybe I need to get my hearing checked...
4317/1:That sure did sound like something.
4318/0:(grunt) I think I'll be all right...
4319/0:I felt something there.
4319/1:What just touched me?
4320/0:(grunt) Draw him off!
4321/0:I felt something there.
4321/1:What just touched me?
4322/0:(grunt) Draw him off!
4323/0:I felt something there.
4323/1:What just touched me?
4324/0:(grunt)  Where did that come from?
4324/1:(grunt) Is ANYWHERE safe these days?!
4325/0:(grunt)  Where did that come from?
4325/1:(grunt) Is ANYWHERE safe these days?!
4326/0:Serious.  Another week of this, and I'm finished.
4327/0:(grunt)  Where did that come from?
4327/1:(grunt) Is ANYWHERE safe these days?!
4328/0:Good advice.  The important thing is to protect the interface to Helios and the Aquinas Network.
4329/0:Good work.  That gives us a good starting point for unraveling the conspiracy.  Please return to the church for your next assignment.  I would like to know what Mako Ballistics has to do with the Templars -- and with your own Dr. Nassif.
4330/0:You've gotten past the checkpoint.  Good.  Now forget everything those troopers just said.  I trust the WTO about as much as I now trust Tarsus.  If you need further proof of the program's duplicity, you should stop by Nassif's apartment.  I got the address when I broke into her office -- Apartment 2224, Emerald Suites.  I'm transmitting a map of the complex to you now.
4331/0:It won't be long now.
4332/0:It's up to you what you do next.
4333/0:You have to play the game to get ahead in a big corporation.  I didn't make the rules -- that's just how it is.
4334/0:Knocked it out?  I said KILL.  If a gob wants to sleep, the trainer just pumps its hide full of zyme.  Sure I saw 'Zilla.  You think I don't know my business?  Damn...
4335/0:By the time we figured out what was happening, it was too late.
4336/0:This isn't a scam, is it?
4337/0:Instruction set decoded.   Integrating unfamiliar components.  Yes, continue.  Four others.
4338/0:Enough interruptions!
4339/0:And Mako Ballistics is reporting that terrorists have infiltrated their Redmond facility and have stolen the plans for a weapon prototype.  The chief engineer was killed in the attack.
4340/0:You know, I could have you SHOT as an Order spy.  The least you could do is be punctual.
4341/0:Is the WTO really that bad?  The enclaves are safe and prosperous.  It seems like a solid foundation for the future.
4342/0:At least I put some money on 'Zilla.  Should be enough for me to buy a few chicks and start rebuilding my lineup.
4343/0:(grunt) Draw her off!
4344/0:(grunt) Draw her off!
4345/0:People will come to be grateful for our heroism.
4346/0:(grunt) Oh, hell...
4346/1:Aagh!
4347/0:(inhale-exhale)
4348/0:(grunt) Oh, hell...
4348/1:Aagh!
4349/0:(grunt) That one hurt.
4349/1:(grunt) ... some serious heat over here.
4350/0:(grunt) That one hurt.
4350/1:(grunt) ... some serious heat over here.
4351/0:(groan)
4351/1:(groan) Guess I might not make it...
4352/0:(groan)
4352/1:(groan) Guess I might not make it...
4353/0:My seekers and I are most loyal to the doctrines laid down by Her Holiness after the Collapse.  What we propose, very openly, is a greater purity of interpretation of these founding principles.
4354/0:(groan) Please... Don't kill me!
4354/1:(groan) Why?  WHY?
4355/0:(groan) Please... Don't kill me!
4355/1:(groan) Why?  WHY?
4356/0:I knew people who died during the plague.  I wonder how many people died because of the terrorists.
4357/0:Please.  I'm SSC.  We're responsible for security during the summit.
4358/0:I had a run-in with the Templars in the apartment building across from the mosque.  They're history.  Maybe there won't be any raid.
4359/0:They don't even know what it is that got spilled yet.
4360/0:Tarsus Academy?
4361/0:And you buy it?  You think Paul and JC are sincere?
4362/0:You're about to become the final catalyst for the next evolution of humankind.
4363/0:I just think the world needs some organization.
4364/0:Tell that gentleman at the table over there that I would like to invite him to my penthouse to discuss his sculptures over a glass of sherry.
4365/0:Who are you?  And how do you know who I am?
4366/0:I thought you were on an important mission for the Luminon.
4367/0:Exactly.  The Order and WTO are just as worried as we are.  The post-Collapse balance of power is very fragile right now.
4368/0:Interesting -- Is he sure?  We've noticed some Templar activity on the north side of town.
4369/0:Gotta get my ekaggat in tune for the match.  That's what the Order Church calls concentration.
4370/0:(groan) I.... can't let it get the best of me...  // panic
4371/0:(groan) I.... can't let it get the best of me...  // panic
4372/0:(groan) I'm wounded bad!
4373/0:(groan) I'm wounded bad!
4374/0:Nice try...
4374/1:You'll have to do better than that.
4375/0:Nice try...
4375/1:You'll have to do better than that.
4376/0:Poison!
4377/0:But the Trier delivery is already a week behind schedule...
4378/0:Poison!
4379/0:(scream)
4380/0:(scream)
4381/0:... processing decentralized... unable... unable...
4382/0:Too bad I'm leaving this place just as the crud's getting vacuumed out of the air.
4383/0:Is that what you plan to tell corporate headhunters?  "What the hell?"
4384/0:I'll take the gas grenades. [300]
4385/0:So you fly modified humans around the world.  That's a pretty weird assignment.  And you're looking for one in particular...?
4386/0:When were you planning on telling the public about the WTO and Order connections?
4387/0:SSC, at your service.
4388/0:Your destiny awaits.
4389/0:Actually, Leo and I requested to be sent here, because this is where you finish training and get briefed on your first assignment.  Isn't it exciting?  I wonder what company I'll be working for.
4390/0:Maybe.  New Cairo has changed recently.
4391/0:
4392/0:I'm calling for a bot.
4393/0:I'm calling for a bot.
4394/0:Ma'am.
4395/0:We're still investigating.  I haven't heard from Captain Lamar since he disobeyed my orders.
4396/0:I can't see!
4397/0:No money.  I'd have to go on foot.  With thermal vision, they'd pick me out on the desert plain like a pilot beacon.
4398/0:I can't see!
4399/0:My parents are dead.  They were in Chicago at the time of the attack.
4400/0:Here's a quick lesson in evolution!
4400/1:
4401/0:(moan)
4401/1:(moan)
4402/0:Great changes are coming.  The right-thinking will be avenged.
4403/0:Here's a quick lesson in evolution!
4403/1:
4404/0:(moan)
4404/1:(moan)
4405/0:Ugh.  Careful -- this one's dangerous.
4406/0:(moan) Got me...
4406/1:Noo... 
4407/0:Ugh.  Careful -- this one's dangerous.
4408/0:(moan) Got me...
4409/0:Ooof!
4409/1:(grunt)
4410/0:Right behind you.
4411/0:Ooof!
4411/1:(grunt)
4412/0:(gasp)
4413/0:Maybe another time.
4414/0:(gasp)
4415/0:Whenever I talk about it, my toe starts to hurt.  Thanks a lot.
4416/0:Yeah, you just move along there, young man.
4417/0:This is gonna be my job...
4418/0:Poor girl...
4419/0:The people seek money and what it can buy -- but what about the heart and the spirit?
4420/0:Is there anything else you need?
4421/0:What do enclave dwellers think of all this?
4422/0:So I guess you've gone rogue on us.  It's not too late to show some loyalty to the WTO.  We want you to destroy the Nassif family's greenhouse, which is in the northwest corner of the south medina.  The experimental greenhouse, a violation of WTO regulations, should lead us to Dr. Nassif. 
4423/0:Get your equipment.  I'll watch your back.
4424/0:Sounds like typical R and D -- an innovation that would expand the biomod market.
4425/0:(grunt) I'm hit!
4425/1:(grunt) Oh, lucky shot!
4426/0:(grunt) I'm hit!
4426/1:(grunt) Oh, lucky shot!
4427/0:(grunt) He got me!
4428/0:(grunt) He got me!
4429/0:(grunt) She got me!
4430/0:Yeah!
4430/1:Time to win a medal...
4430/2:Piece of cake.
4431/0:No one -- just an isolated incident.  Listen, we want the trainees to stay in the rec area.  You'll be safe down here.
4432/0:I'm freezing my ass off out here.  The Omar shut down my enviro-suit remotely.  One good thing about this freakish weather, though: it makes for sharp thermals.  Whatever's under UNATCO, we're not too late to keep them from finding it.
4433/0:You want me to steal a carcass -- from a nightclub?
4434/0:(grunt) She got me!
4435/0:Yeah!
4435/1:Time to win a medal...
4435/2:Piece of cake.
4436/0:(screaming)
4436/1:I'm on fire!
4436/2:It burns!
4437/0:You don't scare me, mister.
4438/0:(screaming)
4438/1:I'm on fire!
4438/2:It burns!
4439/0:You don't scare me, mister.
4440/0:The Director must be paying you well.
4441/0:I was on my way out when they hacked the security.
4442/0:(moan) Was that... poison?!
4442/1:(moan) Oh God, I feel sick...  
4443/0:You don't scare me, lady.
4444/0:I'm Ali Barin, President of Business Development.  Under any other circumstances, I would show you around.
4445/0:(moan) Was that... poison?!
4445/1:(moan) Oh God, I feel sick...  
4446/0:You don't scare me, lady.
4447/0:We can handle this.
4448/0:We can handle this.
4449/0:Easy does it...
4449/1:Don't think I don't know how to use force.  // unconvincing
4450/0:Easy does it...
4450/1:Don't think I don't know how to use force.  // unconvincing
4451/0:
4452/0:There was some confusion over a shipment last night too.
4453/0:I'm just following orders.
4454/0:You will appreciate our merchandise.
4455/0:This has been another... ta-a-alk BULLET!
4456/0:The stairwell will take you straight to the kitchen.  You'll find everything you need there.
4457/0:The Order reprogrammed our security system.  We're stuck here unless we can get past the beam-trigger. 
4458/0:Just get me to the Rauchstadt.  And try not to draw too much attention .
4459/0:I guess you're right about THAT.
4460/0:I can't see!
4460/1:I'm blind!
4461/0:I can't see!
4461/1:I'm blind!
4462/0:The vultures always know when a man's down, don't they?  All right.  Here.  But you can forget the VIP membership.  Word got out about the Omar.  Our VIP lounge is closed indefinitely.
4463/0:Nooo...
4463/1:But... (gasp) You murderer!
4463/2:But I'm innocent!
4464/0:Nooo...
4464/1:But... (gasp) You murderer!
4464/2:But I'm innocent!
4465/0:The stairwell will take you straight to the kitchen.  You'll find everything you need there.
4466/0:(moan)
4466/1:(groan)
4466/2:(grunt)
4467/0:This guy's serious.
4468/0:(moan)
4468/1:(groan)
4468/2:(grunt)
4469/0:This guy's serious.
4470/0:So I've sworn an oath to exterminate defilers of the race.
4471/0:(grunt)Everything's spinning...
4471/1:(grunt)I don't feel so good.
4471/2:(grunt)
4472/0:This lady's serious.
4473/0:(grunt)Everything's spinning...
4473/1:(grunt)I don't feel so good.
4473/2:(grunt)
4474/0:This lady's serious.
4475/0:(gasp)
4476/0:Hang in there.
4476/1:This won't be easy.
4477/0:(gasp)
4478/0:Hang in there.
4478/1:This won't be easy.
4479/0:Oh, Jesus!
4479/1:I can handle this.  I can handle it.  Just gotta stand my ground... // panicked
4479/2:(scream)
4480/0:Scan complete.  You are only minimally biomodified.  We can help correct this.
4481/0:Oh, Jesus!
4481/1:I can handle this.  I can handle it.  Just gotta stand my ground... // panicked
4481/2:(scream)
4482/0:Your purchases will serve you well.
4483/0:Steady, steady -- we can pull through this.
4483/1:We're in trouble!
4483/2:What are we gonna do?
4484/0:Steady, steady -- we can pull through this.
4484/1:We're in trouble!
4484/2:What are we gonna do?
4485/0:You will appreciate our merchandise.  You may purchase now or earn a discount by providing a service to the Omar.
4486/0:Take my advice and call the whole thing off.  Encourage them, and you just make the Church into a bigger problem.  Mark my words... Afraid that's all the time we have.  A pleasure as always.
4487/0:On a stage near the Pequod's coffeeshop.  That'll be SO COOL if you come!  Tickets are 200 credits at the door.
4488/0:Why should I trust someone who spies on me in my own apartment?
4489/0:Mr. Kurczec's delays are costing me money.
4490/0:Not for divebombing.  I've got to cover the cost of ammo.
4491/0:All I need you to do is destroy the machine inside the Statue.  It might still fall into the wrong hands.
4492/0:Hey, I don't have much in the way of a reward, but this showdown just got me a big bonus and put me in tight with the Omar.  You're welcome to half.  Plus I'll throw in a little extra since you've made your own contribution to the Templar body count.  Good work.
4493/0:Hold still!
4493/1:I can't believe I missed!
4494/0:Hold still!
4494/1:I can't believe I missed!
4495/0:I can't connect!
4495/1:Next time, you're really going to feel it.
4496/0:Sorry, I don't have enough money.
4497/0:We're talking about an Omar cyborg.
4498/0:I can't connect!
4498/1:Next time, you're really going to feel it.
4499/0:The next one will find it's mark.
4499/1:That was a warning shot.
4500/0:Oh no!  Here he comes!
4501/0:Pure stinkin' bosh!  She took my jet 'cause she said I came up short on a shipment, but she's a lying thief.  Everyone knows Sid's never lost a load.
4502/0:The next one will find it's mark.
4502/1:That was a warning shot.
4503/0:Oh no!  Here he comes!
4504/0:Someone in Threat Assessment is getting his ass kicked once I get back.
4505/0:(grunt)
4505/1:(grunt)
4505/2:(grunt)
4506/0:Oh no!  Here she comes!
4507/0:(grunt)
4507/1:(grunt)
4507/2:(grunt)
4508/0:Oh no!  Here she comes!
4509/0:You seekers are just little parrots, cheep-cheep-cheep, repeating a new batch of words every week.
4510/0:Pequod's and QueeQueg's are owned by the same people -- it's one company.  I saw the proof in the SSC Evidence Room.
4511/0:Enough of this hide and seek.
4511/1:I can't get a clear shot.
4511/2:I didn't take you for a coward!
4511/3:Show yourself!
4511/4:I'm going to find you eventually...
4512/0:That's gotta hurt.
4512/1:Yes!
4513/0:We can hear them, no longer caged and scared.
4514/0:Enough of this hide and seek.
4514/1:I can't get a clear shot.
4514/2:Too scared to face me?
4514/3:Stop sniveling (scornful) -- Come out and fight me!
4514/4:You're only making this worse for yourself...
4515/0:That's gotta hurt.
4515/1:Yes!
4515/2:Score!
4515/3:Boom! - got'cha.
4515/4:Like that?
4516/0:Damn beggars and thieves.
4516/1:Yep: cross the line, you become a target.
4516/2:I plan to do my duty.
4517/0:Damn beggars and thieves.
4517/1:Yep: cross the line, you become a target.
4517/2:I plan to do my duty.
4518/0:I'm not kidding, buddy
4519/0:What's the passenger's name?
4520/0:I'm not kidding, buddy
4521/0:That's not an acceptable excuse.  However....  (sigh)  Well, I'm afraid we're stuck with each other.  I still need you to find the Sequencing Module and then go through the gateway to JC's sanctuary.  I have my own interest in seeing him revived.  Here is that map I mentioned.
4522/0:You have nothing to worry about now.  The headmaster won't be a problem anymore.
4523/0:This research facility was abandoned by VersaLife nearly two decades ago.  You will need to power up its pilot beacon with a generator on the lower level of the B Wing before you will be able to leave Antarctica.
4524/0:Ready yet?  Let's get out of here.
4525/0:You in love with the guy or something?  Huh.
4526/0:Here you go.  Now keep your nose out of my business.
4527/0:He intends to give every human being a nanite infusion -- That doesn't seem drastic to you?
4528/0:You programmed the biomods?
4529/0:I'm trying to stay focused here.
4530/0:I can't see him...
4530/1:Where did he go?
4531/0:I can't see him...
4531/1:Where did he go?
4532/0:I can't see her...
4532/1:Where did she go?
4533/0:I can't see her...
4533/1:Where did she go?
4534/0:Don't you have any hazmat workers or bots to take care of it?
4535/0:I'm glad you finally came to your senses.
4536/0:Yeah, you better run away.  Ha!
4536/1:Come back here!
4537/0:Yeah, you better run away.  Ha!
4537/1:Come back here!
4538/0:He's on the run!
4538/1:Look at him go!
4539/0:He's on the run!
4539/1:Look at him go!
4540/0:She's on the run!
4540/1:Look at her go!
4541/0:I think they're right.  The WTO's lockin' up all the jobs, all the technology -- and they're turnin' it back on themselves.  They're makin' a super-race with genetics, implants, biomods, whatever it takes.
4542/0:She's on the run!
4542/1:Look at her go!
4543/0:Sure, take out the Templars.  [2000]
4544/0:The transgenic tissue scan you recovered from the basement is already producing improvements in Omar survivability.
4545/0:That's what I wanted to hear.  Here's the payoff.  It's all I got.  You want more, bet on Snake-eyes in the World Championship.
4546/0:Between the radiation and the bots, the risk isn't worth it.
4547/0:
4548/0:Okay.  A Templar paladin, an Omar cyborg, and an Order seeker walk into a bar.  Bartender says, "I'll make you a deal.  First one that mixes a drink that knocks me on my butt, you drink for free.  I'm gettin' killed by these novelty bars with their coconut and Day-Glo and paper umbrellas.  I need a drink of my own."  The Templar goes behind the bar.  He shakes and stirs and yodda yodda he comes up with a Bloody Mary.  Bartender knocks it back in one swallow.  "You call that a DRINK?  Tastes like tomato juice."  "It is the fermented blood of transhumans.  85-proof and laden with toxic particles."  "I don't feel a thing.  Next!"  The Omar goes behind the bar.  Puts his finger in a beer mug and fills it with a brown liquid.  "Tastes like maple syrup!  You couldn't get my grandma drunk with this rubbish."  "It is oil from my body.  Soon you will be one of us."  "Funny, ha ha.  I'm not seeing the hook.  Next!"  Finally the Order seeker goes behind the bar.  He just stands there.  "Well?" says the bartender.  "Make a drink."  The seeker puts a bottle of spring water in front of the other three.  "Water?  That's IT?" says the bartender.  "Drink," says the seeker.  The bartender opens the bottle and takes a sip.  He drops like dead man onto the floor behind his stool.  "What the HELL was THAT?" he says when he wakes up.  "The distilled teachings of the Church.  For a moment, you knew every thought Her Holiness ever had."  "Really?" the bartender says.  "Her Holiness thinks you poisoned her?"
4549/0:Terrorists... wonder what they want...
4550/0:Right, I hear he's taken an unhealthy interest in my architecture.  I hear he's even put out a hit on me.
4551/0:Our children can't sleep at night because they can't breathe this filth, but that's about to change.  You look like you've got more than enough credits to buy breathers for our families.
4552/0:I will take you to the facility.  Realize, however, that I must minimize the danger to my helicopter.  I can't provide air cover or take unnecessary risks.
4553/0:The Nassif girl was one of the key candidates for nanite infusion at Tarsus.  Her whole family is likely to give itself over to that pollution, so they must be exterminated.
4554/0:Report to Tarsus C-14.  You'll need to debrief there.  We're still searching the wreckage at B-5, but we're not hopeful. The extent of the damage in Chicago is significant.
4555/0:It's a war that's coming, a new kind of war...
4556/0:Pretty poor aim there, sport.
4556/1:Good thing for me your aim is terrible.
4557/0:Pretty poor aim there, sport.
4557/1:Good thing for me your aim is terrible.
4558/0:Biomods...  great...
4558/1:Whoa -- this one's a freak -- biomods.
4559/0:Biomods...  great...
4559/1:Whoa -- this one's a freak -- biomods.
4560/0:I guess I can do it, when push comes to shove.
4561/0:We simply want to avoid a price shock.  So far, our most promising intel on your former employer points to a possible smuggling operation with Seattle's Minister of Culture, who lives in an Emerald Suites penthouse.
4562/0:I guess I can do it, when push comes to shove.
4563/0:Look at us!  We're taking care of business.
4564/0:I'm here.  You said you had more to say about the raid on Tarsus.  What went wrong?
4565/0:Look at us!  We're taking care of business.
4566/0:I tried to get answers out of Dr. Nassif, but all she'd give me is the elevator code.  It's 28901, if you need it.  I don't know what's going on, but it's clear we're not safe.  We don't know anyone here, so we'd better watch each other's back.
4567/0:
4568/0:Just gotta hang in there.
4569/0:Just gotta hang in there.
4570/0:I guess I should think of something else to talk about.
4571/0:You Tarsus brats are all the same.
4572/0:
4573/0:I need help.  I'm a helicopter pilot.  They're holding me captive, along with my chopper, at the WTO Terminal in Upper Seattle.
4574/0:
4575/0:Hello there.  Alex, from the Tarsus Program, right?  I wish you hadn't botched the Dr. Nassif interrogation in Cairo.
4576/0:Follow me.
4577/0:Purity is the only way to save humanity from ruin.  I had hoped you'd eventually see this.  The Templars are not murderers.  We passionately want what's best for humankind and realize these dire circumstances demand certain sacrifices.  
4578/0:You also know that Queequeg's Coffee imports exclusively from independent coffee growers from around the world.
4579/0:As you know, the Illuminati has imperceptibly guided civilization for centuries.  How?  Leadership.  We elevate the capable into positions of authority, where they can do the most good for everyone.  JC and Saman both want to level the social order, either by giving biomods to everyone or no one.  It's the same either way -- the end of true leadership and a descent into chaos.
4580/0:You've seen more of the island than I have.  Where do you think the bots will do the most good?
4581/0:We're holding our own.
4582/0:But you could fix them, right?
4583/0:We're holding our own.
4584/0:I'm gonna die!
4585/0:Stand clear.  I'm about to land.
4586/0:The Trader will be happy to discuss possible transactions with you.
4587/0:I'm gonna die!
4588/0:Cairo would be an acceptable destination.  I haven't yet searched Cairo for my passenger.
4589/0:Level 149 penthouses are reserved for arcology management.  Please conduct your business in public areas or leased offices.
4590/0:We're cooked!
4591/0:We're cooked!
4592/0:If it has to be this way...
4592/1:I'm going to do something about this.
4592/2:Guard up!  Defend yourself!
4592/3:I'm going to annihilate you!
4592/4:I'm no stranger to violence.  Prepare to die!
4593/0:If it has to be this way...
4593/1:I'm going to do something about this.
4593/2:You're dead.  I don't mess around...
4593/3:Bet you thought I'd run, huh?
4593/4:I'm going to slice you to pieces!
4593/5:All right -- let's fight.
4594/0:Here we go again!
4594/1:Back for more?
4594/2:Hah!  You won't get away from me this time!
4594/3:The second time's the charm!  
4594/4:Well, hello!  You again.
4594/5:This time I'm going to finish you.
4595/0:Here we go again!
4595/1:Back for more?
4595/2:This time you won't get away!
4595/3:Now I'm going to make you pay...
4595/4:You can't fool me twice!
4596/0:So you're just going to cede this territory?
4597/0:That takes care of the power.  Now get downstairs to load the Sequencing Module.
4598/0:As I suspected.  You are far from loyal to Mr. Dumier, aren't you?  Read that document carefully.  It shows just how deep the Illuminati's deception runs.  The poor soul who runs the coffeeshop would undoubtedly be grateful if you told him how he has been misused.
4599/0:I'm impressed that you would protect the leader of your adversaries.
4600/0:You gave my brother to the Templars.  Now he's a laboratory specimen, if he's alive at all.
4601/0:Unlike my enemies, I've read the classics of political theory.  I know the difference between leadership and ambition.
4602/0:I don't know who -- or what -- you are, but you aren't permitted here.
4603/0:To revive JC, you'll have to repair Helios's five processing modules with an infusion of your biomod architecture.  Prepare yourself for the unexpected, Alex.  JC is conscious but trapped in a struggle with the Helios AI.  His memory is so intermingled with the AI that echoes of his former life are embedded in the very construction of this sanctuary.
4604/0:Thought I'd be an easy target, eh?
4604/1:I'm not going to give up.
4605/0:Thought I'd be an easy target, eh?
4605/1:I'm not going to give up.
4606/0:There are many dissatisfied with the WTO who come here seeking true fulfillment.
4607/0:Some sort of nanotech pollution.  Personally, I think it's population control.  I think the bots from the arcology spread the stuff.
4608/0:I think you underestimated me.
4608/1:You're going to regret this.
4609/0:Oh yeah?  Oh yeah?  Move.
4610/0:These scabs had their chance.
4611/0:I think you underestimated me.
4611/1:You're going to regret this.
4612/0:You should never have messed with us!
4612/1:We can handle this!  Piece of cake!
4613/0:You should never have messed with us!
4613/1:We can handle this!  Piece of cake!
4614/0:Far from it.  We're encouraging relations between the enclaves, not complete mergers.  We want to keep competition dynamic and individuality vibrant. 
4615/0:Just a scratch.
4615/1:You'll have to try harder than that.
4616/0:Just a scratch.
4616/1:You'll have to try harder than that.
4617/0:(grunt)
4617/1:(grunt) I felt that one.
4618/0:(grunt)
4618/1:(grunt) I felt that one.
4619/0:Go AWAY, man...
4620/0:Stay right here.  I'll let you know.
4621/0:Enough for now.  Please leave me to my thoughts.
4622/0:Our orders are to let you pass... against my better judgment.
4623/0:
4624/0:Well, as you can see, the students are hard at work, as usual.  
4625/0:It's tricky getting in and out of this place unnoticed, but there ARE ways to stay inside and out of sight...  I've never been there myself, but I've heard some kids talk about a hideout somewhere in the ventilation system.  I don't think anyone on the faculty knows about it.
4626/0:There is no doubt now.  You are the complete solution, Alex.  The Helios core -- and the parts of JC's mind locked inside it -- have nearly recovered.
4627/0:We offer only the finest technologies, and you will be able to get them at a discount because of your preferred customer status.
4628/0:Remember my advice, Alex.  You will need it.
4629/0:You seem to think you've succeeded.
4630/0:Warning:  Project Serpentine labs have been breached.
4631/0:He could've at least given me my coffee for free.
4632/0:(groan) ... clearly means business.
4632/1:(grunt) This is really starting to add up.
4633/0:(groan) ... clearly means business.
4633/1:(grunt) This is really starting to add up.
4634/0:(groan) ...can't end like this.
4634/1:(groan) ...haven't got much strength left.
4635/0:(groan) ...can't end like this.
4635/1:(groan) ...haven't got much strength left.
4636/0:Easy target!
4636/1:I tried to warn you...
4636/2:Take that!
4637/0:Friend.
4638/0:What for?
4639/0:Easy target!
4639/1:I tried to warn you...
4639/2:Take that!
4640/0:I got him!
4640/1:He's an easy target.
4641/0:I got him!
4641/1:He's an easy target.
4642/0:I got her!
4642/1:She's an easy target.
4643/0:I got her!
4643/1:She's an easy target.
4644/0:You're suing your own company, and the owners don't want the truth to come out in court.
4645/0:Don't think of him as your brother.  He was a clone just like you, the difference being that he has let his anger at his creators turn into megalomania.  He has made YOU into an experiment, remember, and next it will be the whole world, all of us living inside an ApostleCorp laboratory.  Say no, Alex.  For all of us.
4646/0:The Order does not condone violence or the incitement of violence.
4647/0:How can they simultaneously support the ideals of the Order and the commercialism of the WTO?
4648/0:Hmmm, some sort of monomeloecular mesh....  Let me try a different needle.
4649/0:It's getting to be quite a crowd down here for an impregnable fortress.  You were looking for JC Denton, too?
4650/0:Luminon Saman's inflammatory rhetoric is widely believed to have caused the recent unrest in Trier, Germany.  But did adherents to an extreme brand of Order philosophy in Europe carry out a strike in the center of the American heartland?
4651/0:I found peace here, among the Order.  My wish is that you do as well.
4652/0:You've sure got a prime location for your business here.
4653/0:There's no reasoning with you.  We're going to finish this right now.
4654/0:He protects us.  We help him.  These intruders came here to find him... sent a woman in. They must be stopped.  If made free, this one will help you stop these intruders. 
4655/0:Huh?
4655/1:What's that?
4656/0:Thanks for your cooperation.  C'mon in.
4657/0:Huh?
4657/1:What's that?
4658/0:I'm lucky you came along when you did.
4659/0:That wasn't so hard.
4659/1:So much violence...
4659/2:I didn't think I had it in me.
4659/3:Hem.  That was easy.
4659/4:Not so tough after all.
4660/0:Yes.  My enemies seek to establish States, but they forget to heed Plato's good advice -- do not fail to convince the children that the gods are incapable of lying.  But the children's eyes are open.  Are you ready to exorcise the second souls of modified humans, young Knight?
4661/0:That wasn't so hard.
4661/1:So much violence...
4661/2:I didn't think I had it in me.
4661/3:Death is too great a mercy for you...
4661/4:Glad to have THAT taken care of.
4661/5:What a dreadful mess.
4662/0:Are you okay? 
4663/0:It's the same message over and over, yet I can't pull myself away.
4664/0:Are you okay? 
4665/0:Oh God!  What if I'm next!?
4666/0:Well it's now clear that the net has gone black... and we're trapped here.  There's only so much food and energy, but we should be able to come up with some way to get back home.
4667/0:Oh God!  What if I'm next!?
4668/0:Just a few more like that, and we'll be safe.
4669/0:Just a few more like that, and we'll be safe.
4670/0:I've got work to do.
4671/0:You handled that well.
4672/0:To accomplish these ends, they have officially left the Order church and armed themselves.  Grand Master Saman, a former luminon in the Order, has stepped forward to clarify their agenda.
4673/0:You handled that well.
4674/0:Huh?
4674/1:Eh?
4674/2:Oh?
4675/0:Phew.  I'm glad I didn't have to take care of it.
4676/0:This'll be my first real engagement.  Hard to believe.
4677/0:Because these are body-doubles for a phony messiah.  Tell me, who writes the little AI constructs that go into those hologram chapels cropping up everywhere?  Don't play dumb with me, Miss Chen.
4678/0:That's kinda weird.
4678/1:I don't know what that is.
4679/0:That's kinda weird.
4679/1:I don't know what that is.
4680/0:Mr. Paladin didn't say nothin' about splittin' up.
4681/0:There it goes again.
4681/1:It just happened again.
4682/0:We're the good guys.  Trust me.
4683/0:There it goes again.
4683/1:It just happened again.
4684/0:Thanks.
4685/0:Uh-oh.
4685/1:Hm.
4686/0:Uh-oh.
4686/1:Hm.
4687/0:Don't listen to those madmen.  Think for yourself, Alex.
4688/0:(static) This is (static) the Order.  We are now in control of this facility.
4689/0:Excuse me.  I have to get back to work.
4690/0:You have been conditioned by this society.  You suffer from vasana -- You are too attached to the superficial and the material.  Turn away from this false sense of self-limitation to know your true self.  
4691/0:This guy wants to talk to you about Sid.
4692/0:It's such a relief.  Now things can get back to normal around here.
4693/0:I bet we're being targeted by the WTO.  They would love to see the greenhouse fail.
4694/0:I really don't like this.
4694/1:I wish I knew what was going on.
4695/0:This is some coincidence.  Either there's a contract on my head --
4696/0:I really don't like this.
4696/1:I wish I knew what was going on.
4697/0:Oh no.
4697/1:Huh?!
4698/0:Oh no.
4698/1:Huh?!
4699/0:These are trying times for us all.
4700/0:Now my technicians can be certain of our counter-nanite.  Come to New York, young Pliable.  We have work to do.  Your pilot will have to meet you in Flight Bay 23 because my people cannot be interrupted.
4701/0:I'd better get moving.
4701/1:Gonna find out what this is about.
4702/0:Wha---!
4703/0:I'd better get moving.
4703/1:Gonna find out what this is about.
4704/0:For the first time in decades, meteorologists are detecting a dissipation in Nanite Swell 11.  In the history of the fourteen nanite pollution clouds globally, no natural disintegration has ever been observed.  
4705/0:EEK!
4705/1:OH!
4706/0:
4707/0:No one told me anything about an attack.  How bad is it?  I have friends in Chicago.
4708/0:The Order reprogrammed our security system.  We're stuck here unless we can get past the beam-trigger. 
4709/0:One of these gob things got in my brother's house one night.  Damn near killed his wife.  Now she walks with a cane and can't see five feet in front of her face.
4710/0:I need a miracle to save my job.  Please find a way to get that NG endorsement.
4711/0:There she is -- up ahead.  Dr. Nassif turned you into a lab specimen, Alex.  No one will blame you for killing her.
4712/0:A plague, yes... but not in the way they imagine.
4713/0:Yeah, I'm working for the Order Church.
4714/0:Right up ahead, Alex -- transgenics.  This research facility is where Versalife developed many of those creatures.  Sorry to say, the generator is at the back of the complex, in the northeast corner.
4715/0:EEK!
4715/1:OH!
4716/0:Phew.  I guess it was nothing.
4716/1:I must be imagining stuff.
4717/0:Phew.  I guess it was nothing.
4717/1:I must be imagining stuff.
4718/0:You came to Trier looking for a certain ApostleCorp official.  I need you to stay focused on that objective for right now.  If I find out that one of these strikers from Panzerwerks hurt Her Holiness, though, I might have a slightly more dangerous assignment for you.
4719/0:They're dealing with ordinary people, slowly infecting them with the worst kind of biomods -- black market.  As if you can really make a distinction...
4720/0:
4721/0:Aw, poor thing.  
4722/0:We certainly don't have a more determined enemy than Luminon Saman.
4723/0:What do you expect me to do?
4724/0:Aw, poor thing.  
4725/0:They fight 'em to the death.  That's the main difference from when it was humans in the Pit.
4726/0:At least all this has kept school interesting for the past few days.
4727/0:What's the situation here, Captain?
4728/0:I know you probably didn't want to do that -- but thanks.
4729/0:Ew.  It's dead.
4730/0:Ew.  It's dead.
4731/0:You played a pretty low trick on the world, taking advantage of the Collapse to seize power, distracting people with a phony conflict between business and religion.
4732/0:Everything will return to normal soon.  I'm sure of it.
4733/0:I guess you're not very political.
4734/0:Did she give you any trouble, Chris?
4735/0:I see that Dr. Nassif didn't exaggerate about your mental acuity.  Yes, I'm Tong.  I suppose you will be wanting some answers.  You may have already guessed that your true name is Alex Denton.
4736/0:Now my technicians can be certain of our counter-nanite.  Come to New York, young Pliable.  We have work to do.  Your pilot will have to meet you in Flight Bay 23 because my people cannot be interrupted.
4737/0:
4737/1:
4737/2:
4737/3:
4737/4:
4738/0:I'm chasing a guy.  Did you see anyone come through here?
4739/0:I'm chasing a woman.  Did you see anyone come through here?
4740/0:The central office will be thrilled.  They'll believe it was my shop that convinced her.  Let me show you my gratitude with a little something from the Lost-and-Found -- a biomod canister probably left here by one of those little rakes from the Tarsus school.  Those kids are an infestation -- always playing spy games in the office suites.
4741/0:Have you noticed anything unusual?
4741/1:I don't like this.  What do you think?
4741/2:Hmmm...  What do you think is going on?
4742/0:That sounds wrong doesn't it?
4742/1:I don't like the sound of that, do you?
4743/0:Doesn't that look suspicious?
4743/1:I think I just saw something -- did you?
4744/0:Eh?
4744/1:Hm.
4745/0:Eh?
4745/1:Hm.
4746/0:Do you know how this door got opened?
4747/0:What is THAT?!?
4747/1:(shriek)
4748/0:What is THAT?!?
4748/1:(shriek)
4749/0:My girl in the city, Erin, she has a view of Liberty Island.  First she saw some sort of construction project where the Statue used to be.  Sounds like Knights Templar showed up there, too.  Also a flyer friend of mine saw Chairman Dumier and some commandos on the south dock.  I think you're working for the WTO.
4750/0:Thanks for the help.
4751/0:Oh no...  asleep?
4752/0:Oh no...  asleep?
4753/0:How does a groundskeeper know about a classified prototype?
4754/0:You aren't the one to blame.
4755/0:Sayings like that got me where I am today.  Something to think about, while you are still young enough to change your future.
4756/0:Go about your business.
4757/0:At last you have arrived, as JC planned.
4758/0:
4759/0:Chick jumped me!  She went that way.
4760/0:I was wonderin' that myself.
4760/1:Who cares?  It's always the same story.
4761/0:The WTO, Tarsus, or any other corporate entity seeks only to exploit you.  As far as Tarsus is concerned, we're experiments, not people -- just walking petri dishes.  You know we're worth more than that.
4762/0:
4763/0:Hey.
4763/1:What you lookin' at?
4764/0:Whatever.
4764/1:Hey.
4765/0:Aren't we high and mighty...
4765/1:Feeb must be lost...
4766/0:Maybe the WTO's just getting too big.  System's not working as well as it used to.
4767/0:Get out of my face.
4767/1:Pwww!
4768/0:... just mindin' my own business.
4768/1:Uh... hey there.  // nervous
4769/0:Officer.  // sneering
4769/1:I'm not botherin' anyone.
4770/0:... cuttin' me out again.
4770/1:Says if I don't pay I'm gob meat.
4770/2:Think it's contamination, gettin' in my food...
4770/3:Don't know WHERE I'ma crash if that goes down.
4771/0:Finish him off, Alex!  None of us will be safe until he's dead.
4772/0:That's hard.
4772/1:I feel for ya.
4772/2:Man.  // deep sympathy
4773/0:Thanks, I'll take the Glass Destabilizer.
4774/0:The woman from Seattle -- yes.  She's in the upstairs office, reviewing our logs for the Order.  Where are you from?  New Cairo?  Why come here?  The air in the medina is polluted.
4775/0:No worries if you want to deal with Miss Sak for me.  My lips are sealed.
4776/0:It's just a trick.
4777/0:It's just a trick.
4778/0:Time's running out.
4779/0:We ask that all regular customers please respect to the privacy of the clubhouse.
4780/0:How did that move?
4781/0:How did that move?
4782/0:
4783/0:Missing?  Where did it go?
4784/0:What's it gonna be?
4785/0:Missing?  Where did it go?
4786/0:I don't think that's supposed to be there.
4787/0:Now that you know the WTO isn't what it seems, what are you going to do?  Leave the organization?
4788/0:Please deposit credits.
4789/0:Chicago.  You made it out.
4790/0:If the Templars are so appalled by body modification, what do they plan to do with fifty thousand magnetic pulse firearms?  Mmmm?
4791/0:Guess HE forgot his bulletproof bathrobe.
4792/0:We're so close to bringing the plan to fruition.  Hurry!
4793/0:So this "gateway..."  I can use it to find JC Denton?
4794/0:The landing pad is off-limits.
4795/0:I could fight you, I guess, but okay.  How 'bout I give you a down payment on a leather jacket if you tell me about this Mr. P. [50]
4796/0:Squeeze on in, sweetie.
4797/0:What do you mean "no comment"?  I saw a man die.  And a code yellow can't be good.
4798/0:Persistent little bugger.
4799/0:I've about had it.
4799/1:But just wait.  I've got a plan.
4799/2:Ain't gonna be down for long, though.
4799/3:I'm not takin' it anymore.
4800/0:Sure.  // sincere, encouraging.
4800/1:Well, good luck.  I mean it.
4800/2:You'll get through.  You always do.
4801/0:Yeah, man, stand your ground.
4802/0:Yeah, girl, stand your ground.
4803/0:Why isn't this open?  Any ideas?
4804/0:We need answers now.
4805/0:Huh.  It's missing.  Any ideas what's going on here?
4806/0:Look after your interests.  The Omar seek reliable customers.
4807/0:Didn't know you were such a futurist.
4808/0:This has been another... ta-a-alk BULLET!
4809/0:
4810/0:Huh.  It's missing.  Any ideas what's going on here?
4811/0:Contact me from this beacon when you're ready to leave.
4812/0:How did that get over there?  Notice anything?
4813/0:How did that get over there?  Notice anything?
4814/0:I've been moved to Seattle?  What about Billie?  Is she here, too?
4815/0:There's a Seeker down there...  I guess I gotta take him down.
4816/0:You might want to look around over there. 
4816/1:I think someone's over that way. 
4817/0:Take it easy.
4818/0:You better not get me in trouble.
4819/0:
4820/0:I don't think that's supposed to be there.
4821/0:My, my... aren't we jealous?
4822/0:It's broken!  I hope I don't get blamed.
4823/0:I can't help but feel like my every move is being watched.  I must just be getting paranoid...
4824/0:It's broken!  I hope I don't get blamed.
4825/0:I don't know...  I just freeze up whenever I try to mix business and pleasure.
4826/0:Wow.  Someone really wrecked that.
4827/0:Hi.  What's going on?  It looks like this facility is under attack.
4828/0:Wow.  Someone really wrecked that.
4829/0:I apologize.  My overzealous captain disobeyed orders.  He was instructed to mount a rescue.
4830/0:Hm.  I don't think it's supposed to work like that.
4831/0:Hm.  I don't think it's supposed to work like that.
4832/0:I'm running.
4833/0:Move it.
4834/0:Decide for yourself what kind of world would sustain the dignity of humankind.
4835/0:You might want to look around over there. 
4835/1:I think someone's over that way. 
4836/0:There was a guy acting strange -- I think he went that way. 
4836/1:A guy came through, on his way over there. 
4837/0:There was a guy acting strange -- I think he went that way. 
4837/1:A guy came through, on his way over there. 
4838/0:There was a woman acting strange -- I think she went that way. 
4838/1:A woman came through, on her way over there. 
4839/0:There was a woman acting strange -- I think she went that way. 
4839/1:A woman came through, on her way over there. 
4840/0:You look modified.
4841/0:Haven't seen anyone.
4841/1:Sorry.
4842/0:I have work to do.
4843/0:Haven't seen anyone.
4843/1:Sorry.
4844/0:Make a call.  Who's about to be the next Champ?
4845/0:Thought I saw something over there. (points)
4845/1:I think I saw someone.  (points)
4846/0:These are trying times for us all.
4847/0:Thought I saw something over there. (points)
4847/1:I think I saw someone.  (points)
4848/0:Thought I heard something over there. (points)
4848/1:There were some noises coming from over there. (points)
4849/0:What kind of beam-trigger is it?
4850/0:Keep movin'.
4851/0:Someone must've turned it off.
4852/0:We can't talk about this with someone around.
4852/1:I'll tell you more later, when we're alone.
4852/2:This is too touchy to talk about out in the open.
4853/0:Someone must've turned it off.
4854/0:Peace and Order be with you.
4854/1:Good luck as you continue The Search.
4854/2:May the Great Order guide you.
4855/0:I am grateful for your kind sentiments.
4855/1:May you be shielded from Chaos.
4855/2:May the Great Order guide you.
4856/0:I thought that was closed...
4857/0:There's a strange current of spiritual energy here.
4857/1:I saw a message in the stars last night.
4857/2:A shiver just ran down my spine... as if...
4857/3:I can feel the universe's energy coursing through me so strongly today.
4858/0:We're in this together, Alex, whether we like it or not.  The Sequencing Module should be stored on Saman's private computer.  More when you reach the Luminon's command area.
4859/0:JC will need the added security.
4860/0:I thought that was closed...
4861/0:What is it?
4861/1:And...?
4861/2:Can you make any sense of it?
4861/3:Are you certain?
4862/0:Wasn't that open?  Weird.
4863/0:Wasn't that open?  Weird.
4864/0:(Cough cough) I just don't know how much longer I can wait.  
4865/0:It's done.
4866/0:I'll leave for Cairo as soon as I can.
4867/0:We are pleased to serve, especially when so generously compensated.
4868/0:I'm always right here, whenever you want to chat.
4869/0:Huh?
4869/1:Eh?
4869/2:Oh?
4870/0:You think you know what I'm up to?  You're in big trouble if you do...
4871/0:I believe we have a friend in common...
4872/0:Thought I heard something over there. (points)
4872/1:There were some noises coming from over there. (points)
4873/0:Chief Morgan?  You wanted to see me?
4874/0:Some weird guy attacked me!  He went that way. (points)
4875/0:I'm glad to see that you've accepted the Order's assignments.  It looks like your next stop is Mako, north of town.
4876/0:Some weird guy attacked me!  He went that way. (points)
4877/0:Some weird chick attacked me!  She went that way. (points)
4878/0:Someday you will liberate yourself from Tarsus's conditioning.
4879/0:Some weird chick attacked me!  She went that way. (points)
4880/0:I felt something when I was over there.
4881/0:Whole world's divided up into crazies and more crazies.
4882/0:I felt something when I was over there.
4883/0:Better get down there and place your bet.
4884/0:Like I said, a pretty scabby part of town.  Pretty much abandoned except for the church to the northwest.  Maybe one of the squatters knows the area.
4885/0:Hang on, I'll tell you more later.
4885/1:We can't talk about this with someone around.
4885/2:This is too touchy to talk about out in the open.
4886/0:Hang on, I'll tell you more later.
4886/1:We can't talk about this with someone around.
4886/2:This is too touchy to talk about out in the open.
4887/0:What about Her Holiness?  Doesn't she decide what the Church stands for?
4888/0:May Her Holiness watch over you.
4888/1:Good luck as you continue The Search.
4888/2:May you find the Order you seek.
4889/0:Seriously, I'm on duty.
4890/0:We should beware of double-talk.
4890/1:Today will be a good day for decision-making.
4890/2:The tide is about to turn.
4890/3:We need to be careful.
4891/0:What news!
4891/1:You should tell one of the more experienced acolytes about this...
4891/2:I'll keep that in mind.
4891/3:Thanks for sharing your insight.
4892/0:Great soddin' 'ell...
4892/1:Blimey!
4892/2:Well strike me pink.
4893/0:Caught a peek of something...
4893/1:Eh, couldn't quite make out what that was...
4894/0:Well, hello.
4895/0:Happen I heard something...
4895/1:I heard that!
4896/0:I had a run-in with some Templars in the apartment building across from the mosque.  Maybe I scared them off.
4897/0:Jesus-bloody-Christ!  Touched something...  // last part reflective
4898/0:Go on.
4899/0:(grunt) Whadda you want?  // furious
4899/1:(grunt) Hey!  I'll cut your bleedin' throat...
4900/0:
4901/0:Sure 's 'ell ain't fallin' for that.
4901/1:You bodged that little trick, eh?
4902/0:Blood?
4903/0:What about the press?  The added security?
4904/0:That's the machine talking, the machine that runs your cells and rules your heart.
4905/0:The new era will be one of true equality.
4906/0:No just her.  Only JC's can use the gate.  ApostleCorp even had to bring this one the long way.  That control was to keep us all safe, but now that woman has turned wrong.  
4907/0:Well, I'm sorry, but if you're looking for someone to --
4908/0:You will appreciate our merchandise.  You are a welcome customer, having helped us in the past. 
4909/0:May Her Holiness watch over you.
4909/1:Good luck as you continue The Search.
4909/2:May you find the Order you seek.
4910/0:First you'll need a pass to enter the arcology proper.  Take this one. 
4911/0:I return your wishes in kind.
4911/1:May you be shielded from Chaos.
4911/2:May you find the Order you seek.
4912/0:I return your wishes in kind.
4912/1:May you be shielded from Chaos.
4912/2:May you find the Order you seek.
4913/0:I sense a disturbance.
4913/1:Her Holiness spoke to me in a dream last night.
4913/2:I've been having strange visions.
4913/3:My aura... feels... odd.
4914/0:I sense a disturbance.
4914/1:Her Holiness spoke to me in a dream last night.
4914/2:I've been having strange visions.
4914/3:My aura... feels... odd.
4915/0:Really?
4915/1:What do you think it means?
4915/2:Wow.
4915/3:Tell me more.
4916/0:Really?
4916/1:What do you think it means?
4916/2:Wow.
4916/3:Tell me more.
4917/0:I think it portends well for our cause.
4917/1:I think it means something historic is about to happen.
4917/2:It might be a warning of danger.
4917/3:This is going to be an important day.
4918/0:I think it portends well for our cause.
4918/1:I think it means something historic is about to happen.
4918/2:It might be a warning of danger.
4918/3:This is going to be an important day.
4919/0:You better not be feeding me a line.
4920/0:
4921/0:You are wise.
4921/1:That's good to know.
4921/2:You should spread the word.
4921/3:Hmmm...
4922/0:Better take another looksee at these shadows...
4923/0:Brilliant.  A fire.
4924/0:I like being my own boss.  Tag whatever I want, no more, "Shannon, collate this.  Shannon, I need this in triplicate."
4925/0:Looks like smoke.
4926/0:Stinky buggers when they're dead.
4927/0:No one has yet claimed responsibility for the attack on Chicago.  We don't know with any certainty whether it was an accident, an ideological strike against the WTO enclave there, or something else.  Fortunately, we were able to evacuate the trainees there.  They will be joining us at this location and you will be meeting them shortly.  We appreciate your patience during this stressful period.
4928/0:Been some fightin' round about, I dare say.
4929/0:A right hoo-ha over there...
4930/0:Give us your allegiance.  Today we have a chance to bring this planet out of its coma.
4931/0:Hm.  Looks a little beat-up.
4932/0:I helped a harrier pilot take care of an old debt.  He'll fly me in.
4933/0:Looks deliberate.  This thing's cooked.
4934/0:There is, friend.  Join our order.  We work to reverse and eliminate corruption.
4935/0:We will trust the Luminon's judgment.
4936/0:Wonder what caused it to act up...
4937/0:You're lucky they make us check our weapons at the door.
4938/0:You are wise.
4938/1:That's good to know.
4938/2:You should spread the word.
4938/3:Hmmm...
4939/0:Drone constructed.
4940/0:Good.  Helios will -- Wait!  Must be an overload... or a self-destruct sequence.  A blast door just sealed off the only exit.  You'll be trapped unless you can kill the power with the control box on the south wall -- or destroy the exposed conduits.  I should've known old Alex Jacobson would have a surprise waiting for unauthorised users...
4941/0:Warning: Low energy.
4942/0:Drone deconstructing.
4943/0:Scanning area.
4944/0:Thank you for listening, friend.
4945/0:A bad career move for NG, if you ask me.
4946/0:Little do you realize how vulnerable they will be if I can use JC's power against them.  I can remain hidden long enough for Billie to complete her assignment.  Then it will be your turn to hide.
4947/0:Engaging target.
4948/0:Target immobilized.
4949/0:Initiating detonation sequence...
4950/0:Biotox hazard detected.
4951/0:The sooner the better, if you ask me.  I'll catch up to you once you're in position.
4952/0:I had nothing to do with the attack on this lab.  I'm trying to get to JC myself -- can you tell me anything useful?
4953/0:Electrical hazard detected
4954/0:The kitties tell me to do things...to myself.
4955/0:I can't afford the gas grenades now.  Maybe later. [600]
4956/0:Looks like it's on the blink.  Hm.
4957/0:Who turned this on?
4958/0:Heard you've been playin' the Pit.  In a few minutes, they'll start the championship.
4959/0:Who shut this off?
4960/0:It was a baby greasel that got me.  The doctor caught it, raised it, and made a killing at the fights.
4961/0:I wouldn't worry about it.  Every client has a few quirks.  Anything else I can help you with?
4962/0:Oh really?  More fun for us.
4963/0:This light was off...
4964/0:This light was on...
4965/0:I'll check back when I have the money to make a reasonable offer.  [500 credits.]
4966/0:At least this assignment is almost finished.
4967/0:Don't remember that being open...
4968/0:Don't remember that being closed...
4969/0:Seems to still be breathing...
4970/0:Never thought I'd see people DIE.
4971/0:Money is not the supreme reward or motivator.  
4972/0:Knocked his blooming lights out...
4973/0:Knocked her blooming lights out...
4974/0:Good choice, friend.
4975/0:
4976/0:I'm not fallin' for a fool-ass play like that.
4977/0:He informed me.  The WTO Chairman is in the interrogation room upstairs.  Don't worry -- no one's going to get interrogated.  Just a safety precaution.
4978/0:Sorry.  I don't have any credits to spare.
4979/0:Just let him go, Red.
4980/0:Meet the others yet?  They're both upstairs, I think.
4981/0:Have faith.  The Order Church condemns the illegal biomodification experiments performed on you and the other trainees.
4982/0:Cold hazard detected.
4983/0:Heat hazard detected.
4984/0:EMP hazard detected.
4985/0:Radiation hazard detected.
4986/0:Fire hazard detected.
4987/0:Proximity mine detected.
4988/0:The colored light is holographic in nature, just a way to intimidate intruders.  The laser beams themselves are invisible.
4989/0:No host detected.
4990/0:Host detected.
4991/0:Initiating breakdown.
4992/0:I guess I should be grateful you came in to get me.
4993/0:Not exactly.  I --
4994/0:Absorbing...
4995/0:What exactly are you suggesting?
4996/0:Blimey -- a dead body.
4997/0:The vent high on the wall leads to it, but there is a spiderbot keeping vermin out of the ventilation system.  Or you could go through that opening in the floor to the maintenance tunnels.  At the end, past the boilers, there is a ladder to the secret office.  There is some serious climbing and jumping, though, and only the girls in gymnastics have been able to do it.  The code to the room is 9133.
4998/0:Poor sod.
4999/0:A lady caught up in some bad business.
5000/0:Tryin' to hit something with that, eh?
5001/0:Not here anymore.... Hm.
5002/0:What's THAT doing there?
5003/0:Eh?
5003/1:Funny.
5003/2:That's right peculiar...
5004/0:Fancy I better keep a lookout.
5004/1:Blast my bloody nerves.
5005/0:Huh.  Enough to give a man the jitters.
5005/1:Somethin's not right.  I can feel it.
5006/0:You have no idea how important this project is.  If you were in our position, you would see why it was critical to monitor your progress.
5007/0:(sigh) Must be goin' to bits...
5007/1:Hooey.  It's nothing.
5008/0:
5009/0:Cut it out!
5010/0:Never hurts to be prepared for an emergency, I suppose.
5011/0:I'd like to speak to the WTO Chairman.
5012/0:
5013/0:You are becoming a very interesting source of information.  I will help you to recover the component for the teleportation device.
5014/0:Good, that'll buy me a month or two until the Omar sneak another one into town.  Here's your money.
5015/0:Don't disappoint us like your classmate, Miss Sparks.  This was her mission, but she wouldn't follow through.  My people on the ground took her into custody and will handle the transport out of the arcology.  Pay attention, Alex.  I'm through sweet-talking you trainees.  Assassinate Paul Denton or your traitorous friend dies.
5016/0:
5017/0:Real cute.  Just give me the money.
5018/0:Breakdown complete.
5019/0:I heard you talking about Dr. Nassif.
5020/0:Good God!
5021/0:A few extreme activists -- that's all.  Her Holiness came here to try to settle it peacefully -- and Panzerwerks responds by erupting into riots.
5022/0:Come into the light, my enemy...
5022/1:Hm.  Must watch more closely...
5022/2:Could swear I just saw something...
5023/0:I don't care if the director hired you -- she doesn't have the authority to send anyone into this mess.  The WTO is handling the situation now.  We've got bots patrolling, which I can't reprogram at this stage.  There's no way we can guarantee anyone's safety under these conditions.
5024/0:You there!
5024/1:Oh yes, my enemy... come closer.
5025/0:What noise!
5025/1:Hm.  Must listen with both ears...
5026/0:The terrorists are all competing for air time.
5027/0:Then you're probably trapped up on Level 110 -- or dead.
5028/0:(gasp) Something's there!
5029/0:(grunt) You, my lamb, will suffer the curse of the coward...
5029/1:(grunt) This deception will be short-lived...
5030/0:Carry out your orders.
5031/0:I see through your foolish game.
5031/1:You dare to think you can fool ME?
5032/0:Recent fighting.  Well...
5033/0:Mmmmm...  Blood...  Yes indeed...
5034/0:You seem pretty calm.  Most of the other kids around here seem pretty riled up.
5035/0:The punk took off.
5036/0:Damn.  The killer's gone.
5036/1:Murderer!  You got away this time, but I know people!  You can't hide in this town!
5037/0:If you have an energy cell, just give it to one of the bots to bring it back on-line.
5038/0:Seems whoever it was took off.
5039/0:Sticky fingers took off, I suppose.
5040/0:Better take a looksee.
5040/1:Somebody must be arsing about.
5040/2:Tossing bad luck.
5041/0:I have two black-market biomod canisters which enable non-Piezochem functionality.  Also:  three concussion prox mines, which you can plant on any flat surface to be detonated by movement within close range.  As a regular customer, you must pay full price.
5042/0:Just brilliant.  // irritated
5042/1:... give me a blinking ulcer...
5042/2:Yoo-hoo...
5043/0:Hey!
5043/1:Balls...
5043/2:Game's up, Ace.
5044/0:Come out here and answer for yourself!
5044/1:I want to know what this is about.  // nervous
5044/2:Get back here!
5045/0:Wha--!
5045/1:Oh, bollocks!
5046/0:All right, then.  // a little nervous
5046/1:... give you a good thumping.
5046/2:I'm bloody well going to defend myself!
5047/0:Alex, let's talk.  Meet me at the visitation room down the hall.
5048/0:We've got to get out of here.
5049/0:Right.  Well, I'll take out whoever you want for 1000 credits.
5050/0:Hey, I was just attacked by your colleagues at the Tarsus school.  I think the headmaster has assembled his own private security force.
5051/0:How'd you get past the Templar defenses?
5052/0:This area is clear.
5053/0:Yeah...  I saw her in the students' hideout in the ventilation system.
5054/0:It's the only one.  Alex -- I understand you're under pressure from the WTO, but you don't have to become their puppet.  Get to JC and do what you can to finish this project.  If you do that, it won't matter who controls this research because the fruits of all this work will be available to everyone.
5055/0:Might it be the shadow of a person?
5056/0:(laugh)  Yeah, and that the world's been colonized by aliens from another star system and we picked HIM out of everybody who ever lived to save the planet.
5057/0:A fire!
5058/0:MJ-12?  The offshoot of the Illuminati?  This is almost unbelieveable.  They're the ones who started the Gray Death.  I was supposed to be part of a plot to take over the world?
5059/0:Would be wise to find the cause of the smoke.
5060/0:Instead we're trying to protect world leaders...and failing.
5061/0:Hm-hm!  Fitting end for such a beast.
5061/1:May decay hasten its departure...
5062/0:Oh my --
5062/1:(shriek)
5062/2:(yell)
5063/0:What leads to such a fright?
5063/1:Well, well!  A commotion...
5064/0:Who are you -- some PR lady coming to talk me out of it?  I will not give in.  Pequod's runs ads on the public terminal right across the street from my shop, and they don't even have a branch in Trier!
5065/0:I hope we hear soon that the lockdown is lifted.
5066/0:Oh my --
5066/1:(shriek)
5066/2:(yell)
5067/0:This really took a blistering...
5068/0:This is quite ruined.  Lovely.
5069/0:Oh my --
5069/1:(shriek)
5069/2:(yell)
5070/0:I see, mmmm, a malfunction...
5071/0:Someone's been hurt.  It's not safe!
5071/1:Oh my God!  A body!
5072/0:Hm.  It's on...
5073/0:Someone's been hurt.  It's not safe!
5073/1:Oh my God!  A body!
5074/0:Someone's been hurt.  It's not safe!
5074/1:Oh my God!  A body!
5075/0:Decided to fight, did ya?
5075/1:Knob off already!
5075/2:Bloody hell...  // exasperated
5076/0:He's unconscious!
5076/1:Oh God!  But at least it looks like he's still breathing.
5077/0:You dumb galoot.
5078/0:He's unconscious!
5078/1:Oh God!  But at least it looks like he's still breathing.
5079/0:Spud ugly in my sights...
5079/1:Think I have a shot...
5080/0:He's unconscious!
5080/1:Oh God!  But at least it looks like he's still breathing.
5081/0:She's unconscious!
5081/1:Oh God!  But at least it looks like she's still breathing.
5082/0:Oh -- balls!  // remorse
5082/1:Arsed THAT up...
5083/0:We will be more effective as a team.
5084/0:I fancy you're still around here, eh?
5084/1:Yoo-hoo!  Let's play fair now...
5084/2:Lost the sod, but Sid doesn't give up that easy.
5085/0:I've got deadlines!  And I'm going to miss my connection because of this.
5086/0:The body must be dead, or we won't be certain of our enemy's fate.
5087/0:Had enough, eh?
5087/1:Whew.  Running away...
5088/0:Really?  Great.  I'll give you the exterminator's fee then.  Thanks for your help.
5089/0:That was blooming close! // panicky
5089/1:Lucky you can't aim.
5090/0:Like it or not, Alex, we need each other.  It won't be easy for me to forgive your behavior, but I will have to try.  What we need you to do now is check out the Mako facility north of town.  We know they've been doing illegal weapons research and that your former trainer, Dr. Nassif, has contacts there.  You'll need to hire a pilot and leave at once.
5091/0:Stop casing the place.
5092/0:You better go.
5093/0:Blimey!  A cyborg!
5093/1:Modified, eh?
5094/0:(grunt)
5094/1:(grunt)
5095/0:It was engine trouble that brought me down, but of course it's my word against theirs.
5096/0:Welcome.  It's hard to believe that our hard work is nearly done.
5097/0:Move it.
5098/0:I'm certain someone turned it off...
5099/0:Let me think about it.
5100/0:If it wasn't for joining the WTO, Seattle would still be a post-Collapse fishing village.
5101/0:Someone left the light on...
5102/0:Where there's darkness, beware your enemies...
5102/1:Mmmmm.... Did someone turn the light off?  // taunting
5103/0:Hmmm.  It's been opened...
5104/0:That wasn't closed before...
5105/0:She's unconscious!
5105/1:Oh God!  But at least it looks like she's still breathing.
5106/0:What was the enemy thinking?  Mercy?  Or was it guile?
5107/0:My condolences with respect to your daughter.  At least you're okay.
5108/0:Death in all its forms, changeless.
5109/0:Depends on if it gets me a raise.
5110/0:She's unconscious!
5110/1:Oh God!  But at least it looks like she's still breathing.
5111/0:One dark deed begets another...
5112/0:A dead body!
5112/1:Murder!
5113/0:Gah!  One of my own!
5113/1:This malice will be avenged!
5114/0:A dead body!
5114/1:Murder!
5115/0:Someone must've thrown it...
5115/1:Who plays this game with me?
5116/0:A dead body!
5116/1:Murder!
5117/0:Someone killed him!
5117/1:A dead man!  How could this happen?
5118/0:Someone killed him!
5118/1:A dead man!  How could this happen?
5119/0:The service you performed for my business associate is appreciated.  Mr. O'Rourke was a danger to the sect.
5120/0:Someone killed him!
5120/1:A dead man!  How could this happen?
5121/0:Someone killed her!
5121/1:A dead woman!  How could this happen?
5122/0:Someone killed her!
5122/1:A dead woman!  How could this happen?
5123/0:I hope it's nothing serious.
5124/0:They were eliminated.  SSC Chief Vera Maxwell stormed the arcology with forces flown in from Germany, but they were surrounded and are now pinned down somewhere inside the structure.
5125/0:You blew a circuit!  I just know it!
5126/0:I better know a lot more than that if my code is going to be regulating protein synthesis in the cells of your body.
5127/0:At last, Order has triumphed.
5128/0:Well, thanks for you effort.  I guess I'll just need to get in there and find out what's going on myself.
5129/0:Well, thanks for you effort.  I guess I'll just need to get in there and find out what's going on myself.
5130/0:I should warn you that the manager of Club Vox hired me to kill you.
5131/0:How can I get the clearance to other parts of Trier?
5132/0:Someone killed her!
5132/1:A dead woman!  How could this happen?
5133/0:What is THAT?!
5133/1:Some sort of dead monster...
5134/0:Seems like The Order's been getting more intense lately.
5135/0:What is THAT?!
5135/1:Some sort of dead monster...
5136/0:Okay.  The security door for the stairwell to the VIP lounge is on the ground floor.  The code is 11413.  Obey the rules and have a good time.
5137/0:What is THAT?!
5137/1:Some sort of dead monster...
5138/0:You can't fool me THAT easily...
5138/1:I see, someone's trying to distract me...
5139/0:You can't fool me THAT easily...
5139/1:I see, someone's trying to distract me...
5140/0:Close to what?
5141/0:You can't fool me THAT easily...
5141/1:I see, someone's trying to distract me...
5142/0:Smoke...  That's strange.
5143/0:Smoke...  That's strange.
5144/0:Smoke...  That's strange.
5145/0:It does sound a little far-fetched.
5146/0:I don't understand.
5147/0:
5148/0:I don't know how long the medina can survive.
5149/0:In her generosity, Her Holiness has relaxed interpretations of doctrinal law.  It is time for a return to orthodoxy.
5150/0:I have to admit, I'm breathing a sigh of relief.  The troopers thought you were going to come in here and murder everyone.
5151/0:Your motives are clear.
5152/0:Great news.  Thanks.
5153/0:No matter what, though, it never goes away.  (cough cough)
5154/0:I'm away from my posh penthouse right now, probably partying at Club Vox again.  Stop by later.
5155/0:Huh?
5155/1:Eh?
5155/2:Oh?
5156/0:Well... I've got things to do.  See ya later.
5157/0:Just a shadow... I wonder...?
5158/0:Just a shadow... I wonder...?
5159/0:Just a shadow... I wonder...?
5160/0:Looks like there's been a fight here....
5161/0:Is something wrong?
5162/0:Looks like there's been a fight here....
5163/0:Looks like there's been a fight here....
5164/0:I believe you have work to do.
5165/0:Where did that come from?
5166/0:Where did that come from?
5167/0:You know Chief Morgan's orders -- start the interrogation.
5168/0:Where did that come from?
5169/0:We were not meant for mindless subsistence.  We were not meant for clock time -- no, not in this world, nor in the next.
5170/0:It's gone.
5171/0:Thank you for your compliance with these regulations.  You may enter.
5172/0:If you're ready to depart the Mosque, go ahead.  Scanners in the doorway will reactivate all your weapons.
5173/0:Yes.  I'm just another ordinary human being, like you.  My name is Nicolette Duclare.  
5174/0:Had any trouble with the Templars?
5175/0:Don't play dumb.  I just got fired for taking a bribe.  How do you think THAT happened?
5176/0:My brother arrived safely.  Thank you again.
5177/0:An orphan.  You were pretty pampered for an orphan.  Why not be a banker or something?
5178/0:This one can help deal with the intruders.
5179/0:I'd like to make a trade.  You look modified.  Well, I have a biomod canister in my Lost-and-Found, probably left here by one of those little rakes from the Tarsus school, who are always playing spy games in the office suites.  It's yours if you convince Mrs. Withers for me.  Offer her a generous bribe.  [500 credits.]
5180/0:You think you know what I'm up to?  You're in big trouble if you do...
5181/0:I am curious what you will find in the laboratory.  Perhaps Her Holiness has learned something about the Templar plans.
5182/0:I like your music.
5183/0:Well, you've replaced everything else...
5184/0:Need a straight answer -- about anything -- I'll be standing right here.
5185/0:It's gone.
5186/0:It's gone.
5187/0:That's not where it belongs.
5188/0:That's not where it belongs.
5189/0:That's not where it belongs.
5190/0:Wonder what caused this damage... 
5191/0:
5192/0:Wonder what caused this damage... 
5193/0:Wonder what caused this damage... 
5194/0:Please step inside.  Join us for meditation.  Her Holiness awaits your presence.
5195/0:You've sure got a prime location for your business here.
5196/0:Someone destroyed it!
5197/0:Someone destroyed it!
5198/0:Citizens, we have been accused of over-engineering our economy.  Well, this is the legacy we inherited from JC Denton.  JC Denton... the solitary criminal mind that precipitated the Great Collapse and showed us just how fragile the old system was.  "But how?" you ask.  "Just a rumor," you say.  No.  My investigators have uncovered proof underground at Area 51 that he was NOT working for the United Nations and in fact that there never WAS a global terror network.  He acted alone.  Even the recent Chicago disaster pales in comparison to his crimes.  Trust the WTO's cautious policies.  They protect civilization from madness itself.
5199/0:This has been a long week.
5200/0:Guess I'll find my pilot and consider your request.
5201/0:Warning -- Mako facility security has been compromised.
5202/0:What's the connection to the Knights Templar?
5203/0:Alex, guess what I found out?  Your name has appeared in the WTO crime database.
5204/0:So.  You fail to appreciate the situation.  Get your butt to the SSC station.  Now.
5205/0:Someone destroyed it!
5206/0:Looks like a bug.
5207/0:Looks like a bug.
5208/0:Looks like a bug.
5209/0:Yeah, the infolink.  So what?
5210/0:Hm.  It's been shut down.
5211/0:Hm.  It's been shut down.
5212/0:Hm.  It's been shut down.
5213/0:I've completed my mission.
5214/0:How did that get open?
5215/0:Er?
5215/1:What?
5215/2:Hmmm...
5216/0:Signals are mixed at Order headquarters in Lhasa, Tibet.  
5217/0:Er?
5217/1:What?
5217/2:Hmmm...
5218/0:Rescuing one of us is invaluable in helping our kind to survive.
5219/0:Uh...  Anyway... You're right...  I'm not a Templar.  Do you have any idea why they've got you caged up here?
5220/0:We welcome the opportunity to do business with you.
5221/0:
5221/1:
5221/2:
5222/0:No charge.  I'm waiting to pick up a passenger.  Until I locate him, however, I'm authorized to take other jobs..
5223/0:Well, okay.  But I go first.
5224/0:Your daughter's now a Tarsus girl.  Check with the authorities before letting her move into the arcology, though.  There's been some trouble in the city.
5225/0:What about the Illuminati and ApostleCorp?  Won't they find a way to reverse your work?
5226/0:WTO flights are usually on schedule.  But not today.
5227/0:Good luck.  I'll hold fire as long as I can.
5228/0:I'm not kidding, lady.
5229/0:I'm not kidding, lady.
5230/0:Target hit.
5230/1:See that sweet shot?
5230/2:Yeah!  When you're on, you're on!
5231/0:Target hit.
5231/1:See that sweet shot?
5231/2:Yeah!  When you're on, you're on!
5232/0:You should move along.  I don't want anyone to see us talking.
5233/0:
5234/0:What's that?
5235/0:Now finish him off.
5236/0:
5237/0:What's that?
5238/0:Now finish him off.
5239/0:
5240/0:Huh?  I think I just saw something...
5241/0:Now finish her off.
5242/0:
5243/0:Huh?  I think I just saw something...
5244/0:Now finish her off.
5245/0:As the city of Trier gears up for the Order-WTO summit, Vera Maxwell, Executive Commander of the SSC has personally taken control of setting up security for the event.  In an interview with the World News Network, she had this to say:
5246/0:What's that sound?
5247/0:Got the dirty thing.
5247/1:We need a clean shot before this thing gets blood everywhere.
5248/0:I really shouldn't be talking while I'm on watch.
5249/0:What's that sound?
5250/0:Got the dirty thing.
5250/1:We need a clean shot before this thing gets blood everywhere.
5251/0:This is getting on my nerves.
5251/1:That again?
5252/0:This is getting on my nerves.
5252/1:That again?
5253/0:Oh great.  Now what?
5253/1:That got my attention.
5253/2:Hey, what's that?
5254/0:Oh great.  Now what?
5254/1:That got my attention.
5254/2:Hey, what's that?
5255/0:We've got to act fast.  Our destiny awaits.
5256/0:Well, of course.  I --
5257/0:We've declared open war.  Today the Templars avenge themselves against Philip the Fair, who drove us underground nearly eight centuries ago.  Is it so difficult to understand?
5258/0:You're the one who went inside.  You tell me -- I'm curious.  Even the WTO authorities have been excluded, and they lack justification for a search warrant.
5259/0:I don't know what they've done to me, but with the power you could give him, JC should be able to set it straight.
5260/0:Alex.  I just talked to Dr. Nassif.  Know anything about a Code Yellow emergency?  A security guard has been murdered.
5261/0:I have seen the future, and I warn you.  It belongs to the Omar.
5262/0:This is what we've been working toward, ever since I uncovered the truth about UNATCO and MJ-12, even if I didn't realize it at the time.  I trust his vision.
5263/0:This obsession with other people's business is so juvenile.
5264/0:Hold on.  First I need to lighten my load.  I'm carrying too much.
5265/0:I didn't bust into the enclave to meet people.
5266/0:I'd like to know what they feed that gob to make it so damn invincible.
5267/0:Ha!
5267/1:Let's make it dirty, then.
5267/2:You let your guard down.
5268/0:Femi!  Yes...!  At last.
5269/0:Ha!
5269/1:Let's make it dirty, then.
5269/2:You let your guard down.
5270/0:Are you his new chamber-boy?
5271/0:Thank you again for your help.
5272/0:There.
5272/1:Messy business.
5272/2:One less beggar lurking around the walls of the cities...
5272/3:Time to write up a fatality report.
5272/4:Another fine job.
5273/0:There.
5273/1:Messy business.
5273/2:One less beggar lurking around the walls of the cities...
5273/3:Time to write up a fatality report.
5273/4:Mission accomplished.
5273/5:And THAT's how it's done.
5273/6:Guess rehabilitation's out of the question...
5273/7:Another notch for my gun...
5274/0:This doesn't seem right.
5275/0:Filthy piece of trash.
5276/0:I hope someone does something before it's too late.
5277/0:This doesn't seem right.
5278/0:Filthy piece of trash.
5279/0:Hey!
5279/1:Something's definitely going on...
5280/0:Shouldn't spit on a man's uniform...
5281/0:Hey!
5281/1:Something's definitely going on...
5282/0:Shouldn't spit on a man's uniform...
5283/0:Oh, tra-la-la-lala.... I think I'll fire the bitch.  Right now.
5284/0:I really don't like the looks of this.
5284/1:I'm gonna find out exactly what's going on here.
5285/0:Shouldn't spit on a man's uniform...
5286/0:I really don't like the looks of this.
5286/1:I'm gonna find out exactly what's going on here.
5287/0:Shouldn't spit on a man's uniform...
5288/0:Whoa!
5288/1:Wha--?
5288/2:Uh-oh!
5289/0:Whoa!
5289/1:Wha--?
5289/2:Uh-oh!
5290/0:Uh, I don't know...
5291/0:I guess it's back to normal now.
5291/1:Just jumping to the wrong conclusions, I guess.
5292/0:I guess it's back to normal now.
5292/1:Just jumping to the wrong conclusions, I guess.
5293/0:I just have to believe in Her Holiness.  Order WILL prevail.
5294/0:You're pretty friendly for a rich kid.
5295/0:First that stuff in Nassif's office and now this...  Tarsus has been lying to us.  But I have friends planning a rescue -- this code yellow is probably a sign they're on the move.
5296/0:This is our haven from the madness and greed the WTO tries to spread.
5297/0:Peace will return slowly now.
5298/0:So what've you been up to, Alex?  Globe-hopping for one of the post-Collapse quasi-governments?
5299/0:Wrong suite.  Sorry.
5300/0:As the city of Trier gears up for the Order-WTO summit, Vera Maxwell, Executive Commander of the SSC has personally taken control of setting up security for the event.  In an interview with the World News Network, she had this to say:
5301/0:Okay.
5302/0:I said beat it.
5303/0:Our technology will change what it means to be human.  Conflict will be an anachronism.  The only danger is that our research could be stolen.  In the hands of a group like the Illuminati, it would be a weapon of unimaginable destructiveness.
5304/0:Let me introduce myself.  Leila Nassif, Director of the Tarsus Academy here in Seattle.
5305/0:The schedule's a bit backed up due to some unusual circumstances earlier that put a few flights on hold.
5306/0:I sure hope they get her out of there.
5307/0:Big as a cow... Yeah, big as TWO COWS, and I killed it.
5308/0:Big as a cow... Yeah, big as TWO COWS, and I killed it.
5309/0:Play dead.
5309/1:Cybernetic battle system, my ass.
5310/0:Play dead.
5310/1:Cybernetic battle system, my ass.
5311/0:I guess the troublemaker moved on.
5312/0:No crook gets through me.
5312/1:Break the law, I break your skull.
5313/0:Yes.  I'm listening.
5314/0:I guess the troublemaker moved on.
5315/0:No crook gets through me.
5315/1:Break the law, I break your skull.
5316/0:Perhaps I can be of assistance later.
5317/0:So I've got one, too.  The Omar network informed me of your assault.
5318/0:Looks like the bully left.
5319/0:You crossed the line, buddy.
5320/0:The epicenter of the Chicago event was on the street in front of our building.  We were the target.  I'm sure of that.
5321/0:You crossed the line, buddy.
5322/0:Looks like the murderer moved along.
5323/0:You crossed the line, lady.
5324/0:You crossed the line, lady.
5325/0:Wherever they are, I hope they're okay.
5326/0:I guess the thief took off.
5327/0:Poor little thing.  So frightened.
5328/0:Sounds like a risky operation, but I take it you can afford to hire a few thugs of your own.
5329/0:Let's hope she has a sense of humor.
5330/0:Get out of there!  You'll get hurt!
5331/0:We've got to find those Omar and eliminate them.  How dare they operate in Trier, where we are strongest.
5332/0:Well, here's your chance to settle an old score.
5333/0:So ApostleCorp has some sort of home base in Cairo.  I guess we know where you're going to find your next target -- but first you must deal with the scientist in the weapons lab.
5334/0:The Pit used to be MY gig, back when the sewer wasn't overrun with gobs.
5335/0:Justice delayed is justice denied.  Know what I'm saying?
5336/0:Look after your interests.  The Omar seek reliable customers.
5337/0:
5337/1:
5337/2:
5338/0:Billie's been working for the Templars all along.  She single-handedly brought down ApostleCorp... and helped destroy her home city.
5339/0:You've probably never given an Omar a chance.
5340/0:Situation resolved.
5340/1:Sweet.
5340/2:Done.  Thanks for helping out.
5341/0:Don't disappoint us like your classmate, Miss Sparks.  This was her mission, but she wouldn't follow through.  My people on the ground took her into custody and will handle the transport out of the arcology.  Pay attention, Alex.  I'm through sweet-talking you trainees.  Assassinate Paul Denton or your traitorous friend dies.
5342/0:It's a good thing you came along when you did.
5343/0:Situation resolved.
5343/1:Sweet.
5343/2:Done.  Thanks for helping out.
5343/3:These beggars just throw themselves at us...
5344/0:Guess we better fill out a report.
5345/0:Guess we better fill out a report.
5346/0:Ran out of extra lives, I guess.
5347/0:I think he's dead.
5348/0:I think he's dead.
5349/0:
5350/0:Oh my God!  That cat's on fire!
5351/0:I think she's dead.
5352/0:Wait -- I've got to make room.
5353/0:I think she's dead.
5354/0:Whoa.  Something must've startled that rat.
5355/0:What are we?  Game wardens?
5356/0:What are we?  Game wardens?
5357/0:Poor birdy.
5358/0:Whoa.  Someone really messed up that bot.
5359/0:Hey, I don't have much in the way of a reward, but this showdown just got me a big bonus and put me in tight with the Omar.  You're welcome to half.
5360/0:Your grandfather wants to shut you up until you're old and scared of life like him.
5361/0:Disgusting....
5362/0:The Scriptures, though...  Were they --
5363/0:You might be on to something there.
5364/0:I've been talking with their High Augur, Lin May Chen. There was some miscommunication about the raid but the main objectives were still accomplished.  They showed us what was really going on behind the scenes and freed us.  I'm grateful, and you should be too.
5365/0:Give me the biomod canister.  [500]
5366/0:Step up and take your medicine.
5366/1:That all you got?
5366/2:I'm ready when you are.
5366/3:You're in for it now.
5366/4:Now you see you can't handle a WTO officer.
5367/0:Step up and take your medicine.
5367/1:That all you got?
5367/2:I'm ready when you are.
5367/3:WTO don't raise no fools.
5367/4:This will be your last time messing with the WTO.
5368/0:I have military training, you know.
5368/1:Take your best shot.
5368/2:... show you how we scrape scum like you off the street...
5369/0:I have military training, you know.
5369/1:Take your best shot.
5369/2:... show you how we scrape scum like you off the street...
5370/0:Make a move, big guy.
5371/0:Make a move, big guy.
5372/0:Make a move, babe.
5373/0:Make a move, babe.
5374/0:A textbook hostile; no sweat.
5374/1:Let's take control of the situation.
5375/0:A textbook hostile; no sweat.
5375/1:Let's take control of the situation.
5376/0:I owe you my life.  My career is saved!  Let me show you those weapon mods I was talking about -- an Ammo Scavenger, a Fragmentary Rounds Mod, and a Glass Destabilizer. I got them off an Omar who was crucified at the end of the street.  Gruesome scene.  The work of the Templars, I'm sure.
5377/0:Anything I can do to help?
5378/0:God dammit.  Here's your money.  But tell your boss I need that shipment, and I need it now.
5379/0:The SSC tries to be prepared for every possibility... but I just don't see how we could've predicted THIS one.
5380/0:I wandered off the tour.  So you're custom-designing weapons for this group calling itself the Templars?
5381/0:You can't let the Templars or the Illuminati cloud your judgment.
5382/0:I see that Dr. Nassif didn't exaggerate about your mental acuity.  Yes, I'm Tong.  I suppose you will be wanting some answers.  You may have already guessed that your true name is Alex Denton.
5383/0:
5384/0:Haven't seen YOU around here before.
5385/0:Not going to let you by this time, Alex.  I didn't know you were so squeamish about combat, until I saw how you handled Antarctica.  You hardly even scratched me and just ran and hid!  This time we'll finish it.
5386/0:Not my concern.  There is always strife.  I ask because I can make a deal for someone who could get into the New Cairo arcology and do QueeQueg's a favor.
5387/0:He doesn't scare ME.
5388/0:He doesn't scare ME.
5389/0:Yeah.  I work for the genetically impure.  Sounds like we're gonna need weapons, too.
5390/0:She doesn't scare ME.
5391/0:She doesn't scare ME.
5392/0:... mean little suckers...
5393/0:The Omar appreciate your business.
5394/0:... mean little suckers...
5395/0:Bots comin' and goin' all day.  The arcology wouldn't set all of this up if it didn't do SOME good.
5396/0:Sorry -- I'm not on the menu.
5397/0:Sorry -- I'm not on the menu.
5398/0:The air's full of toxic nanite debris, decades-old fallout from the Collapse, they say. They keep dragging in more villagers -- a pretty pitiful sight.
5399/0:And I thought MY breath was bad...
5400/0:Thanks for the help.  You just turned the Seattle coffee business on its head.
5401/0:And I thought MY breath was bad...
5402/0:Uh -- sorry, this isn't Pequod's, that's on 107.  This is the nanoformer bot kennel.  You know?  "We keep the skies friendly...?"
5403/0:The inclinator has been shut down until further notice, after an explosion early this morning.  Investigators are still trying to determine whether this catastrophe was caused by malfunction or by foul play.  Seattle News 9 will bring you more information as it becomes available.
5404/0:
5404/1:
5404/2:
5405/0:No problem.  I'll keep a safe distance for now.  When you want to leave, contact me with this beacon.
5406/0:No one forced me into the covert ops program.
5407/0:And what did you find?
5408/0:Let me finish my run.
5409/0:We just want to get away from the Hateful Ones.
5410/0:(sigh)  Thank God.  I'm gonna lose my edge if I stand here any longer.
5411/0:We've got work to do.
5412/0:Along with the dignity of the species, we will preserve the dignity of the human mind.
5413/0:How can you desert me like this?!
5413/1:Coward!
5414/0:Pequod's is on the cutting edge of nutrition and biomedicine.  Our coffee will whiten your teeth and protect against ulcers.
5415/0:How can you desert me like this?!
5415/1:Coward!
5416/0:(ahem)  We'll finish this when we've got more privacy.
5417/0:I've been talking with their High Augur, Lin May Chen. There was some miscommunication about the raid but the main objectives were still accomplished.  They showed us what was really going on behind the scenes and freed us.  I'm grateful, and you should be too.
5418/0:(ahem)  We'll finish this when we've got more privacy.
5419/0:Just had this pressed...
5419/1:Well, that's another story...
5419/2:Too damn many forms.
5419/3:The new taxes are bleeding me dry.
5419/4:What'll they think of next?
5419/5:They better not send the bill to ME...
5419/6:Must have something caught in my teerh...
5419/7:I've smelled that perfume somewhere before...
5419/8:Need to spend more time at the gym...
5419/9:I should have gotten the more expensive one...
5419/10:Who says that money can't buy happiness?
5419/11:I'm looking good today.
5419/12:I need to get my shoes shined.
5419/13:I'll need to hire a new secretary...
5419/14:I could use a bigger apartment.
5420/0:Come on, metal mouth.
5421/0:I'm so sick of these long hours...
5421/1:I need to clean out my wardrobe...
5421/2:Better chase down that invoice...
5421/3:Wish they'd hurry up and give me another raise...
5421/4:The fool shouldn't have tried to cheat me...
5421/5:Excellent wine.  I wish I could remember the vintage.
5421/6:I'd better talk to my broker before the market shifts.
5421/7:They weren't THAT expensive...
5421/8:Oh well, I'll just buy another one...
5421/9:It's kind of uncomfortable, but it sure looks nice.
5421/10:The place could stand to be redecorated...
5421/11:I could really use a manicure.
5421/12:How do I tell him not to wear that tie...?
5421/13:Should get a colorist to check my lipstick...
5421/14:I should get a poodle.
5422/0:Come on, metal mouth.
5423/0:It's not safe!
5423/1:We're in danger!
5424/0:Now for a quick takedown.
5424/1:This should be easy.
5425/0:
5425/1:
5426/0:It's not safe!
5426/1:We're in danger!
5427/0:Now for a quick takedown.
5427/1:This should be easy.
5428/0:You lookin' for ME?  Huh?  You lookin' for LEO JANKOWSKI?  I'm probably in the rec area workin' out or already on a plane for HORDE RCP, Special Security Division... and I bet you wish it was you.  Huh, plebe?
5429/0:
5430/0:Oh no!  I'm sorry! 
5430/1:Oops!
5431/0:Change your mind?  Too late.
5431/1:This is what we do with beggars who get out of line.
5432/0:Oh no!  I'm sorry! 
5432/1:Oops!
5433/0:Change your mind?  Too late.
5433/1:This is what we do with beggars who get out of line.
5434/0:You're in the game, D.  Now get in there and shake your pom-poms for Gob-zilla.  She'll be comin' out the south chute!
5435/0:Target's still hot.
5435/1:Finish this.
5436/0:
5437/0:Target's still hot.
5437/1:Finish this.
5438/0:Follow through.  This one has some training.
5439/0:Religious crazies... nothing is good enough for them unless you are praying twenty-fours hours a day.
5440/0:Follow through.  This one has some training.
5441/0:
5442/0:Are you deaf?
5443/0:If you have an energy cell, just give it to one of the bots to bring it back on-line.
5444/0:Sssh.  
5445/0:No more tomorrows for the scientists at the old base.
5446/0:Normally I would have you killed on the spot, but you are still my best asset against Saman.  Hopefully, in time, you will change your opinion of my cause.
5447/0:Well, I think it's time we all stop taking orders and start thinking for ourselves.
5448/0:(grunt)
5448/1:(ahem)
5448/2:(sneeze)
5448/3:(grumble)
5448/4:(whistle)
5449/0:Most WTO personnel believe in the original charter.  The organization as a whole can prevail against one man.
5450/0:(grunt)
5450/1:(ahem)
5450/2:(sneeze)
5450/3:(grumble)
5450/4:(whistle)
5451/0:Vermin!
5452/0:Vermin!
5453/0:What a cute little cat.
5454/0:He's about had it.
5455/0:What a cute little cat.
5456/0:He's about had it.
5457/0:Look at that bird.
5458/0:She's about had it.
5459/0:I feel like I've really done some good work here.  I can't wait for my next assignment.
5460/0:Look at that bird.
5461/0:She's about had it.
5462/0:Stand back!  I tossed in a grenade!
5463/0:... filthy beast.
5464/0:If you want to know what I think, I think it's another cult, like the Order.
5465/0:Stand back!  I tossed in a grenade!
5466/0:... filthy beast.
5467/0:It just won't die!
5468/0:It just won't die!
5469/0:You need work, you go to the Pit.  This is what I did.  I found work.  Mercenary.  Black market.  In a few hours, they send me to Egypt.
5470/0:(grunt)
5470/1:(grunt)
5470/2:(grunt)
5471/0:(grunt)
5471/1:(grunt)
5471/2:(grunt)
5472/0:Every society has organization.
5473/0:Me neither but -- jeez.  That's pretty extreme.  I doubt there's any chance now that you'll be able to eavesdrop on the recruiting kiosk, which is what we need -- the specifics about the raid.
5474/0:
5475/0:Those scientists at Tarsus Academy are part of an obscure group called ApostleCorp.  They have a cell at Mako, which would concern the Templars because Mako is their main supplier of weapons.
5476/0:I've been waiting for your summons.  Please, make me a Knight.
5477/0:Sure thing.
5478/0:I think the ice is a sign...  of what?  I don't know.
5479/0:We've just received a report of a fatality in the Galleria.  Your rescue mission was a failure.  You'll be held responsible for putting those people at risk and failing to get them both to safety.
5480/0:You will be impressed.  Speak with the trader.
5481/0:No....!  NO!  The Templars are damaging the Helios core!  Satisfied, Alex?  I'm mortal like you again.  Helios won't be able to save me this time, but I don't plan to be the one who needs saving.
5482/0:Uh -- no one.  Is something wrong?
5483/0:I saw you looking at me from across the room -- and then you walked right over.  How nice.  Ever since I became the enclave's Minister of Culture, most people treat me with a certain chilly deference.
5484/0:Incoming!
5485/0:Incoming!
5486/0:We will do business with you, even though you misled the Omar in Cairo, regarding the Templar raid.
5487/0:Uh-oh.  Someone's boobytrapping the place.
5488/0:Uh-oh.  Someone's boobytrapping the place.
5489/0:I'm trying to track someone down -- noticed anything unusual?
5489/1:Has anyone come this way?
5490/0:No!
5490/1:Murderer!
5490/2:Try that on ME, beggar...
5491/0:I'm trying to track someone down -- noticed anything unusual?
5491/1:Has anyone come this way?
5492/0:No!
5492/1:Murderer!
5492/2:Try that on ME, beggar...
5493/0:I'm following someone.  Have you noticed anything out of the ordinary?
5494/0:He's dead!  // to self
5495/0:I'm following someone.  Have you noticed anything out of the ordinary?
5496/0:He's dead!  // to self
5497/0:I'm following a guy.  Have you seen him?
5498/0:She's dead!  // to self
5499/0:I'm following a guy.  Have you seen him?
5500/0:She's dead!  // to self
5501/0:Officer down!
5502/0:Wha---!
5503/0:Officer down!
5504/0:No-o-o-o!  Die, freak!
5505/0:No-o-o-o!  Die, freak!
5506/0:You can feel the electricity!
5507/0:(pause)  You are an arrogant fool.  Dr. Todd is waiting for you in the flight bay.  Give him what he needs, or my paladins, who have been instructed to hold their fire, will instead execute you.  I will have additional instructions for you when you reach Liberty Island.
5508/0:Boltcaster -- no need to kill anyone.
5509/0:I know you've been working for the Order and that they may have reasons to want Dr. Nassif dead.  I'm part of the WTO now and we don't believe in vigilantism.  I plan to enforce the law, no matter who threatens Nassif. We need her alive AND conscious for quick information extraction.
5510/0:No one knew that name.  By the 2050's, communications protocols had become successively more comprehensive and classified, until there was only one Protocol, synonymous with all economic activity yet managed by a very small group of people.
5511/0:That's a lovely mess you've made down there.  You've put me in a bind, Alex.  It's critical that I try to recruit you to our cause, but to be honest I would like nothing more right now than for one of my troopers to put a bullet in the back of your head.
5512/0:I knew it!  They got her, too!   Her Holiness be damned!
5513/0:That's against the rules!
5514/0:
5515/0:I don't know.  This is my first time at an NG kiosk....
5516/0:Go away.
5517/0:She doesn't do so bad for herself, considering the state of the economy since the Collapse.
5518/0:Deep in your heart, you know you will eventually join the Search.
5519/0:I'm following this lady.  Have you seen her?
5520/0:Grateful?  Miscommunication?  They were shooting at us!
5521/0:I'm following this lady.  Have you seen her?
5522/0:The Black Gate ruins are up ahead.  Access to the underground facility is on the second level of the complex.
5523/0:Did you tell him about the other proposals?  He thinks you stole his idea.
5524/0:
5525/0:Do you know what that could be?
5526/0:Do you know what that could be?
5527/0:They'll probably have me inspecting cargo tomorrow.
5528/0:Did you hear something?
5529/0:It killed an officer!
5530/0:Looks like they're about to close up.  See you next time.
5531/0:I guess it beats being a pustule-ridden beggar in the medina.
5532/0:Did you hear something?
5533/0:It killed an officer!
5534/0:Am I crazy?  Did you just see something?
5535/0:Good one!
5535/1:Ten points for the good guys!
5535/2:I'll second that.
5536/0:And I'm right behind her.
5537/0:Am I crazy?  Did you just see something?
5538/0:Good one!
5538/1:Ten points for the good guys!
5538/2:I'll second that.
5539/0:I'm sure I just saw something -- did you?
5540/0:He felt that one.
5541/0:I'm sure I just saw something -- did you?
5542/0:He felt that one.
5543/0:Just so long as it doesn't come to open war.  Seems like every day someone else is building an army.
5544/0:She felt that one.
5545/0:She felt that one.
5546/0:Justice delayed is justice denied.  Know what I'm saying?
5547/0:No just her.  Only JC's can use the gate.  ApostleCorp even had to bring this one the long way.  That control was to keep us all safe, but now that woman has turned wrong.  
5548/0:Glad you're on MY side.
5548/1:Good job!  Wow -- I saw the whole thing!
5548/2:A picturebook takedown.  Wish I had my camera.
5549/0:Glad you're on MY side.
5549/1:Good job!  Wow -- I saw the whole thing!
5549/2:A picturebook takedown.  Wish I had my camera.
5550/0:In the coming weeks, we will each be presenting new by-laws that will eventually create an interlocking relationship between the two groups, so that our coexistence will be complementary rather than conflicting in the future.
5551/0:There's something you might want to know... Your colleagues at the Tarsus school were all hand-picked by the headmaster.  He seems to be assembling his own security force.
5552/0:It's not so much the people as the gobs.  You know, mutants.
5553/0:I need help.  I'm a helicopter pilot.  They're holding me captive, along with my chopper, at the WTO Terminal in Upper Seattle.
5554/0:
5555/0:On a stage near the Pequod's coffeeshop.  I put you down for a free ticket -- remember?  That'll be SO COOL if you come!
5556/0:
5557/0:What's the alternative?
5558/0:For Trier?
5559/0:Go.  Before more seekers arrive.
5560/0:Splendid.  Here's your money.  I knew you were the type when you walked in the front door.
5561/0:You're late.  Mr. O'Rourke will want an explanation.
5562/0:
5563/0:Who's responsible for this?
5564/0:You'd think with a weapon like that there'd be some bonuses.
5565/0:Who's responsible for this?
5566/0:Why is this off?
5567/0:Thanks.  I guess I should meet our "hostess" here already.  Not much else I CAN do and maybe I can get some better answers in person.  You coming?
5568/0:I said go.
5569/0:It's high time the Order and the WTO signed a non-aggression pact.  The treatment of Her Holiness should convince people of that much.
5570/0:Why is this off?
5571/0:Why is this open?
5572/0:Why is this open?
5573/0:The Arcology Director's office has determined that the particle haze outside the city contains highly bioactive nanotech fallout.  
5574/0:Why is this closed?
5575/0:Why is this closed?
5576/0:Just walk away, Billie.  I'm here to awaken JC.
5577/0:Take care of yourself, Alex.  You've been through a lot.
5578/0:Would you like to be?
5579/0:Any idea what's spooking the animals?
5580/0:Any idea what's spooking the animals?
5581/0:Thank you again for all your help.
5582/0:Exactly!  I was just thinking about that.  I bet the executives would make me the manager of the whole region if I could pull that off.  Regrettably, Miss Withers said NG is pretty picky about that sort of thing.
5583/0:Not yet.  I'll let you know.
5584/0:She was a human being, for God's sake.
5585/0:How can you be sure?  What did you see?
5586/0:What do you mean?
5587/0:Understood.
5588/0:Please -- I have preparations to make.
5589/0:
5590/0:You will be followed, and we will be questioned.  Try not to make it any harder on us.
5591/0:Do you have a street map?  I can mark where they are.
5592/0:Why don't you keep your mouth shut and just stay out of SSC's way?
5593/0:Just walk away, Billie.  I'm here to awaken JC.
5594/0:I'm sorry.  That's what he said.
5595/0:I've got to find the person responsible for this -- any leads?
5596/0:I've got to find the person responsible for this -- any leads?
5597/0:You're startin' to sound like a rookie.  Sak isn't exactly discreet.  When it comes to clientele, SSC should have better standards.
5598/0:Oh God -- I've got to find the murderer -- any leads?
5599/0:Oh God -- I've got to find the murderer -- any leads?
5600/0:Check around over there.
5600/1:Take a look over that way.
5601/0:The workers?!  They just want a production bonus, but now they get nothing because the Seekers' sabotage has pushed them off schedule.
5602/0:Check around over there.
5602/1:Take a look over that way.
5603/0:What do you mean?
5604/0:Give me the energy cells. [600]
5605/0:How do I do that?
5606/0:I don't know.  I think I saw someone over there.
5606/1:I think I saw something over there.
5607/0:I don't know.  I think I saw someone over there.
5607/1:I think I saw something over there.
5608/0:Yes!  I'm playing RIGHT NOW.
5609/0:There was a strange woman around.  I just saw her over there.
5610/0:There was a strange woman around.  I just saw her over there.
5611/0:I want to fight, but what is there to fight?  Dust.  Nothing but dust.
5612/0:They were in the way.
5613/0:Chen means well, but sometimes her methods aren't the most effective.
5614/0:Unbelievable -- the Chairman himself is a Templar.  Maybe you should locate the files he was talking about and confront him in the hangar bay.
5615/0:Interesting.  Anything else?
5616/0:So... you saying you want to bring the investigator into this matter?
5617/0:The black market biomod sounds like a deal.  I'll take it. [500]
5618/0:How does that sound, darling?
5619/0:Then I won't be letting you in.
5620/0:There was a strange man around.  I just saw him over there.
5621/0:There was a strange man around.  I just saw him over there.
5622/0:There were some strange noises coming from that way.
5623/0:There were some strange noises coming from that way.
5624/0:I was attacked by some strange guy -- then he took off.
5625/0:I was attacked by some strange guy -- then he took off.
5626/0:I was attacked by some strange woman -- then she took off.
5627/0:I was attacked by some strange woman -- then she took off.
5628/0:Something bumped into me when I was over there.
5629/0:I can tell you what happened to your lawsuit.
5630/0:You have a point there.
5631/0:Looks like you checked out at HQ.  You're free to pass.
5632/0:Something bumped into me when I was over there.
5633/0:Eddie hired some scab to kill the Champ, but he won't get away with it.  I'll put out my own contract, one with his name on it.
5634/0:You do the bidding of Chairman Dumier, but is your heart in it?  Or are you tempted to share the Aquinas specification with us?  We offer you your humanity, whereas he can give you nothing but secular power.
5635/0:A failed corporation named VersaLife.  The Omar have learned much from the VersaLife laboratories abandoned after the Collapse.  Shall we conduct business?
5636/0:Very well.
5637/0:I think this is supposed to be off.
5638/0:QueeQuegs got an early lead in the poorer neighborhoods, but they won't be able to compete for long.
5639/0:I think this is supposed to be off.
5640/0:I cannot believe these delays today!
5641/0:I think that's supposed to be on.
5642/0:I think that's supposed to be on.
5643/0:Who the hell do you think you are?  That facility downstairs is classified.  Think you can take on all of WTO security?
5644/0:Guess I can forget about collecting that fine.
5645/0:This is in my way.
5646/0:He's a great principal.  These kids are lucky.
5647/0:This is in my way.
5648/0:Just tryin' to scrip' a livin' any way I can.
5649/0:Tarsus Tracking Report 1242 -- Klara Sparks.  She is naive, but loyal.  She's allied herself with the WTO, who've placed her high in the ranks, owing to her abilities.  Intel suggests that Dumier has recognized her special attributes as well, and seems to be treating her as a special protege.  She was last seen in Trier, dispatched for security for the Order-WTO summit.
5650/0:Ungh.  This door won't open.
5651/0:P said stand here.  I'm standin' here, and now I wanna go shoppin'.
5652/0:Then of course I had to crash-land into Lake Washington.
5653/0:
5654/0:As we try to head off a public relations firestorm over inadequate background checking, we are asking all current employees to submit complete references and resume as soon as possible.  Thank you for your prompt cooperation.
5655/0:Sorry.
5655/1:Nope.
5655/2:Haven't noticed a thing.
5656/0:Sorry.
5656/1:Nope.
5656/2:Haven't noticed a thing.
5657/0:Good day.
5657/1:Greetings.
5658/0:Good day.
5658/1:Greetings.
5659/0:Hello.
5659/1:Good day.
5660/0:I'll be here if you need me.
5661/0:Hello.
5661/1:Good day.
5662/0:Isn't this news about Chicago just mind-boggling?
5662/1:Can you believe what they're saying about the Order?
5663/0:Isn't this news about Chicago just mind-boggling?
5663/1:Can you believe what they're saying about the Order?
5664/0:I'm busy right now.
5664/1:Can't say I care.
5665/0:I'm busy right now.
5665/1:Can't say I care.
5666/0:I mean, how loyal can you be to us if you're willing to turn against your own kind?
5667/0:You in love with the guy or something?  Huh.
5668/0:I just wanted a steady job, not a holy war.
5669/0:To prevent us from overpowering our masters by sheer numbers, we were created unable to reproduce.  That is why the Templar threat to us is so dire -- we are all that remains.  And that is why it is especially tragic that even you inflict your violent ways on our kind.
5670/0:I still don't like being spied on.
5671/0:...and now onto the rest of the Nassif clan.  Immediately.
5672/0:Ungh.  This door won't open.
5673/0:I'll just give this a push...
5674/0:I'll just give this a push...
5675/0:No way -- I'm not going into THAT!
5676/0:No way -- I'm not going into THAT!
5677/0:What's it do -- trip an alarm?
5678/0:Far from it.  We're encouraging relations between the enclaves, not complete mergers.  We want to keep competition dynamic and individuality vibrant. 
5679/0:Just watch what you're doing now.
5680/0:
5681/0:Hmph.  People today.
5681/1:Really?
5682/0:Hmph.  People today.
5682/1:Really?
5683/0:You have no reason to see Miss Sak.
5684/0:Get out of my face.
5684/1:I've got better things to do.
5685/0:The Templars can't possibly be paying enough taxes on their little project.  They're transporting Powered Assault Armor and in large numbers.
5686/0:
5686/1:
5687/0:Get out of my face.
5687/1:I've got better things to do.
5688/0:I am not amused.
5688/1:You must have something else to do right now.
5688/2:I'd appreciate it if you'd stop that.
5689/0:Positive.
5690/0:I am not amused.
5690/1:You must have something else to do right now.
5690/2:I'd appreciate it if you'd stop that.
5691/0:Please get away from me.
5691/1:Keep your hands to yourself.
5691/2:Pay more attention to where you're going.
5691/3:Hey!  You bumped me!
5691/4:I say!  Watch where you're going.
5691/5:Pardon me, but you stepped on my foot!
5692/0:Oh well.
5693/0:Please get away from me.
5693/1:Keep your hands to yourself.
5693/2:Pay more attention to where you're going.
5693/3:Beg pardon.
5693/4:Excuse me.
5693/5:Oh dear... we collided.
5694/0:Do you realize whom you're assaulting?
5694/1:I'm not afraid of you and your petty attacks.
5694/2:I will call security if you keep this up.
5695/0:I'm starting to enjoy myself.
5696/0:test.
5697/0:Do you realize whom you're assaulting?
5697/1:I'm not afraid of you and your petty attacks.
5697/2:I will call security if you keep this up.
5698/0:That's better.  The Leo Jankowski I met in Seattle doesn't stand around moping about his problems.
5699/0:They came in the night.  I couldn't see their faces.  Now Garai, my brother... Well, at least it was over quickly.  There's no such thing as police anymore -- just thugs with uniforms.
5700/0:Take it easy.
5701/0:I heard there was trouble at Tarsus today.
5702/0:My lawyer knows how to prosecute pushy fangirls.
5703/0:I understand.
5704/0:Sorry, I'm broke.
5705/0:A new face.  Interesting.  Introduce yourself.
5706/0:Grateful?  Miscommunication?  They were shooting at us!
5707/0:No thanks.
5708/0:JC Denton has a hold on your imagination, perhaps.  Talk to your friend Leo in front of the mosque.  See how much he likes enforced modification.  Do you really think ApostleCorp is any different than the sect of the Omar?
5709/0:I want to see Dr. Nassif.
5710/0:Finally -- it's about time you woke up.  C'mon on in.  We've got to talk about what's been going on around here.
5711/0:I'm plagued by spies -- even in here.
5712/0:Almost gotcha.
5713/0:I'm the reason Gob-zilla's dead.  I think you owe me.
5714/0:Almost gotcha.
5715/0:Just relax.  You look like you could use some down-time.
5716/0:Thank you for your compliance with these regulations.  You may enter.
5717/0:I don't have one.  How do I get one?
5718/0:How'd you know that I just trashed QueeQueg's?
5719/0:I'm sending in a bot.
5720/0:We deserve better treatment than this.
5721/0:I'm sending in a bot.
5722/0:Why Egypt?
5723/0:Please leave me to my work.
5724/0:I'm carrying too much.  I've got to drop something first.
5725/0:It's not polite to stare.
5725/1:I wish you wouldn't look at me like that.
5725/2:I don't really enjoy being studied like this.
5725/3:(clears throat) Yes?
5726/0:You better find somewhere else to loaf around.
5727/0:Well, fuel's burnin'.
5728/0:It's not polite to stare.
5728/1:I wish you wouldn't look at me like that.
5728/2:I don't really enjoy being studied like this.
5728/3:Are you looking at ME?
5728/4:Do you need something, dear?
5729/0:You're acting awfully strange...
5729/1:Enough with this nonsense.
5729/2:Stop goofing around and move along already.
5729/3:Excuse me, I don't believe you should be doing that...
5729/4:Ahem... that's not a good idea...
5729/5:I recommend that you find some other way to amuse yourself.
5730/0:You're acting awfully strange...
5730/1:Enough with this nonsense.
5730/2:Stop goofing around and move along already.
5730/3:What on earth do you think you're doing?
5730/4:I've never seen such a thing!
5730/5:Goodness -- what ever are you doing?
5731/0:Just get to the Statue in one piece.  The rest is simple.
5732/0:We have been trying to persuade Panzerwerks to stop polluting this region and restore to Nature what is rightfully hers.  
5733/0:No need to get drastic.
5733/1:Hey, hey, we're all friends here...
5733/2:Watch it!
5734/0:No need to get drastic.
5734/1:Hey, hey, we're all friends here...
5734/2:Watch it!
5735/0:You're trespassing.
5735/1:This area's restricted.
5735/2:I seriously doubt you're authorized to be here.
5736/0:You're trespassing.
5736/1:This area's restricted.
5736/2:I seriously doubt you're authorized to be here.
5737/0:
5738/0:Have some respect!
5738/1:Find a different way to amuse yourself.
5738/2:I don't appreciate this.
5739/0:Have some respect!
5739/1:Find a different way to amuse yourself.
5739/2:I don't appreciate this.
5740/0:
5741/0:Okay.  I'll be right behind you.
5742/0:Are you sure?
5743/0:Here you go.  [100 credits.]
5744/0:What about the situation in the Inclinator?
5745/0:I never imagined that all four of our facilities would be compromised at once.
5746/0:We've decided to adopt, Nicolette and I.  We're going to adopt the population of the entire planet.
5747/0:
5747/1:
5748/0:I'm calling for a bot.
5749/0:I'm calling for a bot.
5750/0:I do not think SSC is really qualified to deal with a situation like this. 
5751/0:If you're trying to enter, you're out of luck.  No admittance without an Arcology passcode.
5752/0:Some people think we're just focused on profit, but we've got regulations to protect the environment.  Regulations, not mystical chants like the Order.
5753/0:I'm not afraid of you.
5753/1:I can take care of you.
5754/0:You have no reason to hate us, Alex.
5755/0:I just got an update from Chief Morgan -- what were you thinking?  We needed that information fast, and now you've ruined our chances. You could've helped the WTO and they could've helped you, but now it's clear that you're only going to jeopardize our objectives.  My new orders are to neutralize you, like any other extremist operative.
5756/0:Wish I had more cash.  I'd bet more.  [500 credits.]
5757/0:Thanks.  There's sensors that will reactivate everything on your way out.  You're clear to go on in now.
5758/0:What do you mean -- I didn't do anything.
5759/0:... lost in Paris... too weak to fight the new breed...
5760/0:The Illuminati have weathered many upheavals.
5761/0:The Order reprogrammed our security system.  We're stuck here unless we can get past the beam-trigger. 
5762/0:You can't really compare two hot spots in Seattle to the obliteration of an entire city.  I don't think we're a target in the same way Chicago was.
5763/0:These arcology types want to be perfect and live forever, so they pour money into this stuff.  But this stuff's not people.  It's dead.  It's dead money and polycarbons.
5764/0:You aren't cleared to enter the landing bay, Alex.  Come back upstairs and report to my office at once.  My people are in the middle of a very important investigation.
5765/0:Do not spread corruption and disorder.  Acknowledge your responsibilities to your fellows and to the Earth.  Doing otherwise means you pollute the world with what Muslims have called fasad, or earthly corruption,  in following a path other than the Search.  Do not deny the call to Order that you feel in your spirit and you will help to eliminate fasad.
5766/0:We share your condemnation of the WTO, and we appreciate your dedication to nonviolent solutions when possible.
5767/0:I can't afford the ammo clips. [600]
5768/0:I'm not afraid of you.
5768/1:I can take care of you.
5769/0:Noo...
5769/1:Where's my mom?
5770/0:Noo...
5770/1:Where's my mom?
5771/0:(grunt)
5771/1:(grunt)
5772/0:(grunt)
5772/1:(grunt)
5773/0:It can be difficult to see that from the outside.
5774/0:Umph.
5774/1:(grunt)
5775/0:Umph.
5775/1:(grunt)
5776/0:People should trust Tarsus.  We are the best for a reason.
5777/0:And where are they getting this firepower and training?  Obviously they're organized.
5778/0:I really thought this summit would let us do something about terrorism.  Oh well.
5779/0:Whether it's a concert where people get a little out of hand or a lonely walk home late at night -- For the times when you need a little extra punch -- Horde Riot Control Products gives you the Stun Prod.
5780/0:Right...  Where Leila went to school.  She helped her cousin get on the same track -- to a decent life.  Now we are targets.
5781/0:And mine, too, apparently.
5782/0:For you? No charge.  I'm waiting to pick up a passenger, but for now I'm open and feeling generous.
5783/0:
5783/1:
5784/0:Excellent.  You've done much to bring peace to this neglected part of the city.
5785/0:It is merely another test along the path to true Order.
5786/0:What do the Templars want?  World domination?
5787/0:Got the signal, loud and clear.  Let me know when I should fly in.
5788/0:You seem pretty calm.  Considering what's been going on, I would expect most of the students to be a litte nervous.
5789/0:Maybe later.
5790/0:(gasp)
5791/0:(gasp)
5792/0:My aim sucks.
5792/1:I missed.
5793/0:My aim sucks.
5793/1:I missed.
5794/0:The unlock weapons scan is automatic.  I don't have to do anything.
5795/0:(grunt)  Gotcha!
5796/0:I always wonder, though, when did the arcology leadership know?  Did they tell us right away?
5797/0:The Hateful Ones must be stopped.
5798/0:Not the same as the captors.  We can sense it.  Can you free us?
5799/0:
5800/0:(grunt)  Gotcha!
5801/0:Better look again.  They did the same thing to me during summer recon.  I got a perfect score because I kept my cool.
5802/0:Very soon we will be connected. A great Advance will change what it means to be human, and there will be no further need to conceal information.  But that world is not yet here.
5803/0:The intellectual property has been secured and will be analyzed by our experts.  Well done.  We will have another mission for you as soon as you learn where Dr. Nassif went.  Look for clues in the biolab on the second floor.  Those nanomanipulators in the Minister of Culture's penthouse were headed for a scientist there -- probably an ApostleCorp sleeper agent.
5804/0:Simpson said Apostlecorp takes unsuspecting CHILDREN, runs tests on them and starts breaking their bodies down in elementary school, like they're just animals.  I've heard they've even killed people for spare body parts.
5805/0:When the time is right.  Right now the general populace simply isn't ready for this kind of information.  At this stage, we're only telling select individuals in the higher echelons of each organization.
5806/0:You will be gratified to hear that our test was successful.  Paul Denton has survived, and his biomod architecture has yielded a nearly perfect nanite predator.
5807/0:Okay, I'll get out without being seen.
5808/0:You must be a new tenant.  I don't recognize you.
5809/0:Shall we leave?
5810/0:Yes -- our researchers have been observing your training and living quarters.  Don't be alarmed.  Such precautions are standard procedure before giving trainees their corporate assignments.
5811/0:Let the Order into your heart and learn another way.  We were meant to believe, to aspire -- yes, aspire...
5812/0:Thanks.  I suppose this Summit meeting must be good for business.
5813/0:I'm just on watch.  Talk to the teacher if you need something.
5814/0:(groan)
5814/1:(grunt) Blast it!
5815/0:(moan)
5815/1:(moan) Oh, Lord...
5816/0:Hey-hey!  Not a scratch!
5817/0:Brother Lamar spoke to me when he entered the enclave.  He and his Seekers are sworn followers of Her Holiness.  They would raise their hands in battle only if provoked.
5818/0:Was that supposed to hurt, old boy?
5819/0:Come out -- I can't see you.
5819/1:Stop hiding.
5820/0:Was that supposed to hurt, my lady?
5821/0:Our condolences to the families and friends of all those lost in the Chicago incident.
5822/0:Come out -- I can't see you.
5822/1:Stop hiding.
5823/0:(gasp) (cough)
5824/0:(scream)
5825/0:Fraidy cat!
5825/1:Come back and fight!
5826/0:(groan) I can't see!
5827/0:My seekers and I are most loyal to the doctrines laid down by Her Holiness after the Collapse.  What we propose, very openly, is a greater purity of interpretation of these founding principles.
5828/0:Gotta be mobile to make a living in this trade.
5829/0:Fraidy cat!
5829/1:Come back and fight!
5830/0:Oh, balls!  Grenade!
5831/0:A trap!  Some sort of prox mine...
5832/0:Ha ha.  You missed me.
5833/0:Ha ha.  You missed me.
5834/0:This is WTO Security Chief Donna Morgan.  I thought you were told to report to the air terminal.  Very well.  Stroll around the Galleria, but be forewarned.  Terrorists reprogrammed the security systems to attack Upper Seattle residents and might still be in the area.  Some shoppers are pinned down in there, too.
5835/0:This city is lost.  Toxic air and a fanatic group enforcing a military state.
5836/0:No transaction possible.
5837/0:What's wrong with New Cairo?
5838/0:I think I'm going to make it.
5839/0:I never saw one credit from the very gob I DISCOVERED and helped to track down.
5840/0:Information not relevant.
5841/0:At least I put some money on 'Zilla.  Should be enough for me to buy a few chicks and start rebuilding my lineup.
5842/0:Someone must've taken it...
5843/0:How'd that get there?  Hm-hm... Tell-tale signs...
5844/0:Every time I look at a public terminal, we're one step closer to all-out war.
5845/0:Mmm?
5845/1:How peculiar...
5846/0:I'll ask Grandfather.
5847/0:Something vile, I'm certain.
5847/1:Hmmm.  I'm not often mistaken...  // tentative
5848/0:I just wanted to let you know that the man at the bar, Seattle's Minister of Culture, would like to invite you to his penthouse to talk about your sculptures.
5849/0:I daresay it happened again.
5849/1:Hmmm.  Now what?
5850/0:So you've been here two weeks.  Any advice?
5851/0:Where to?  Going rate minus twenty percent.  [400]
5852/0:I must be mistaken after all.
5852/1:Oh well.  No blame visits he who errs on the side of caution.
5853/0:Got away.  Astounding.  // sardonic
5853/1:I won't be caught napping a second time...
5854/0:So I'm going to be merged with Helios just like JC is?
5855/0:Please do something.  Tell the authorities or stop Archer yourself.  We can't.
5856/0:It looks like the phrenology team is going to make their deadline after all.  Get in touch with me so we can plan the next phase.
5857/0:Well, a fighter.  A fighter and a coward.
5857/1:Sure did cause a scene.  Well, back to business.
5858/0:
5859/0:Gone.  Well, I will have vengeance nonetheless.
5859/1:The murderous lout got away...  // seething
5860/0:Guess I'm the fool this time.
5860/1:The thief must be long gone.
5861/0:To date, the Church's leader has hidden behind a cloak of secrecy, appearing to her followers only as Her Holiness.  Furthermore, Fundamentalists such as Luminon Saman, champion a much stricter interpretation of Order doctrine.
5862/0:
5862/1:
5862/2:
5863/0:(moan)
5864/0:Just let us know.
5865/0:(grunt) Buggers.
5866/0:Uh!
5867/0:What do you mean?
5868/0:(gasp)
5869/0:I think I'm going to make it.
5870/0:Beauty.
5870/1:Ha!  // surprised at his success
5870/2:Had enough?
5870/3:Nice.
5871/0:Bad business, this one.
5871/1:I came through that all right, I guess.
5871/2:Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.   // supercilious
5872/0:It's not just logic, though.  I think I have the Gift.
5873/0:This is kinda scary.
5874/0:Cheerio, poor sod.
5875/0:I don't believe we've met.
5876/0:This is kinda scary.
5877/0:Off the mark a bit that time...
5877/1:Damn.
5877/2:Bollocks!
5878/0:Can't seem to aim today...
5878/1:By criminy I'm a rotten shot.
5879/0:I'm screwed.
5880/0:Got you by the short and curlies...
5880/1:Lovely spot you got yourself in.
5881/0:I'm screwed.
5882/0:Let's get this started.
5883/0:Let's get this started.
5884/0:An Order terrorist might have poisoned the water supply.  Please, I must check the pipes.
5885/0:There he is -- the head scientist.  That's what you call a soft target.  Take him out.  The Order will be displeased if you fail to achieve this objective.
5886/0:Thank you again.  Perhaps we will be okay.
5887/0:Later, dude
5888/0:My paladins, today you will be tested.  All guards will be on the highest state of alert.  We are no longer invisible, and our enemies are closing in.  Protect the compound and the materials stolen from Panzerwerks at all costs.  With them, we will clothe each Soldier of Purity in exoskeletal armor and assure swift victory.
5889/0:Defiler, you escape this time, but your day of reckoning will come.
5889/1:A minor inconvenience.  The time approaches when I will confront the fool.
5889/2:My pretty slips through my grasp...
5889/3:The defiler escaped...
5890/0:The jackal himself!  And I lost the scent...
5891/0:The jackal herself!  And I lost the scent...
5892/0:The moment arrives...
5892/1:Are you so foolish as to think you might catch me unprepared...?
5892/2:Yes.... nearer draws the enemy...
5893/0:I feel you trembling, my pretty imp...
5893/1:Why such shame?  Please.  Let my eyes be the judge...
5893/2:Cease these trifles!
5893/3:You dare provoke me?
5894/0:Indeed.  You fell right into my hands.
5894/1:Welcome, frail beast.
5895/0:Come before me!
5895/1:Errant fool!
5896/0:Looks like people from Tarsus are mixed up in that transaction.  I'd like to know why they're running equipment to Mako Ballistics -- and why a weapon called the Mag Rail has been commissioned by the Knights Templar..  Find a pilot and get to the Mako campus at once.
5897/0:By the chin of Baphomet, I will find you!
5897/1:Enough chicanery!
5897/2:Too late for hiding...
5898/0:Eddie wants to keep this quiet.
5899/0:Face your doom, child.
5900/0:What the--!
5900/1:No!
5901/0:That one song isn't so bad, you know... Hum-um-hummm-mm-mm-um.  But most of her stuff has too much attitude for a guy like me.
5902/0:Come on, scally.
5902/1:I know how to handle myself. // unconvincing
5903/0:Guess this is it, eh?
5903/1:One more...
5903/2:When I have to take care of business, I take care of business.
5904/0:(grunt)
5904/1:(grunt)
5904/2:(grunt)
5905/0:Panzerwerks -- It's not just a name, it's a commitment -- to security, to safety, and most of all, to the community.  
5906/0:... have to grub up some more credits...
5906/1:Steamin' evil world...
5906/2:More dirty business...
5906/3:Blast it all...
5906/4:... pure rubbish, if you ask me...
5907/0:(grrr)  // grumble
5907/1:(snort)
5907/2:(clears throat)
5907/3:(whistling)  // strained, nervous
5908/0:Not again.
5909/0:I say!
5909/1:That's real daft.
5910/0:Me neither but -- jeez.  That's pretty extreme.  I doubt there's any chance now that you'll be able to eavesdrop on the recruiting kiosk, which is what we need -- the specifics about the raid.
5911/0:Not again.
5912/0:Bloody watch your step.
5912/1:Tryin' to pick my pocket?  Eh?
5913/0:Right smart set of duds I got, eh?
5913/1:Keeping my eye on you, too, mate.
5913/2:Boo!
5913/3:I don't like you lurkin' about and not sayin' anything.
5914/0:(grunt) ...that really hurt...
5914/1:(grunt) ...I'm just a kid...
5915/0:See somethin' you like, honey?
5915/1:Can't keep your eyes off me, eh?
5916/0:Look out!
5917/0:(grunt) ...that really hurt...
5917/1:(grunt) ...I'm just a kid...
5918/0:Quit arsing around.
5918/1:That's askin' for trouble, mate.
5918/2:Oh that's just smashing brilliant.
5919/0:Stay sharp, kiddo.
5920/0:(grunt) ...feeling awfully dizzy...
5920/1:(grunt) ...wha?  huh?
5921/0:(grunt) ...feeling awfully dizzy...
5921/1:(grunt) ...wha?  huh?
5922/0:You're starting to make me nervous, lady.
5923/0:This has been another... ta-a-alk BULLET!
5924/0:This is a great place for people-watching.  I'm gathering material.
5925/0:
5925/1:
5925/2:
5925/3:
5926/0:I'll be right there.
5927/0:Good.  A test of my strength.
5928/0:By Purity, I will destroy you!
5929/0:Fool.
5930/0:At last, the great distorter...
5931/0:Your luck ends here!
5931/1:A worthy contest.
5932/0:Purity delayed is Purity defiled...
5933/0:You do jest...
5934/0:Yes, come closer...
5935/0:May the hand of Baphomet guide my aim...
5936/0:One clean shot remakes the world...
5937/0:Hi.  I'm NG Resonance.  What would you like to chat about?
5938/0:
5939/0:Knob off.  You aren't supposed to be here.
5940/0:We interrogated one of Captain Lamar's people.  She said that the scientists in this laboratory are the ones who smuggled Dr. Nassif and her colleagues out of the city.  See if you can find a clue to Dr. Nassif's whereabouts in the lab director's office.
5941/0:Easy now.
5941/1:You have a beef with me?  What for?
5941/2:Hey.... Whatever it is, I'm not the bloke who did it.  // nervous
5942/0:I don't go lookin' for fights, m'lad.
5943/0:I don't go lookin' for fights, m'lady.
5944/0:(grunt) I just want to take a nap.
5944/1:(grunt) It's getting kinda dark...
5945/0:Not ME!
5945/1:Watch it, nob.
5946/0:(grunt) I just want to take a nap.
5946/1:(grunt) It's getting kinda dark...
5947/0:Really!
5947/1:Stop that.
5947/2:See anybody laughin'?  Maybe it's not funny.
5948/0:Heard the beacon's been activated.  Good work.
5949/0:Don't get cheeky with me.
5949/1:Time for you to sod off, don't you think?
5950/0:(shrieking)
5950/1:I'm on FIRE!
5950/2:Water!!
5951/0:Enough goo-goo eyes.  You're making me nervous.
5951/1:Later, baby.  Later.
5952/0:(shrieking)
5952/1:I'm on FIRE!
5952/2:Water!!
5953/0:Spanking good show -- if you want to end up in the clink.
5953/1:That's really quite enough!
5953/2:You're a real case, aren't you?
5954/0:Baby's gone a little round the twist, it seems.
5955/0:I'll keep that in mind.
5956/0:(grunt) I don't feel so good.
5956/1:(grunt) I think something... poison...
5957/0:(grunt) I don't feel so good.
5957/1:(grunt) I think something... poison...
5958/0:(grunt) I can't see!
5958/1:(grunt) ...something in my eyes!
5959/0:
5960/0:I guess you're here to wipe us out.  Like JC Denton wiped out the people who ran HIS trials.  Well, we aren't as diabolical as MJ-12 was.  I hope you aren't planning to trigger another Collapse...
5961/0:You'd be calling attention to yourself.  That what you want?
5962/0:Depends on what you mean by "scrip'."
5963/0:Let the hunt begin...
5963/1:Now you're sorry -- yes, but it's too late.
5964/0:Belief needs no armaments!
5965/0:Are you hiding, my child?
5966/0:How I love to see the ill-formed scurry away at my feet...
5967/0:
5968/0:I have you on the run!
5968/1:I will not be denied...
5969/0:No one defies the Templars and lives!  No one!
5970/0:How feeble...
5970/1:Ha!  You missed me!
5970/2:Bad time to be making mistakes.
5971/0:I'm ready.
5972/0:I'm not impressed by your clumsy biomods.
5973/0:The latest in our ongoing coverage of the missing persons reports at the Tarsus Academy in New Cairo.  
5974/0:You're free to pass.
5975/0:
5976/0:The machine has sunk deep into your flesh, I see.  Is there a part left you still call 
5977/0:Buddy's gone a little round the twist, it seems.
5978/0:Bloody hell, that hurt!
5978/1:Don't do that again!  I mean it!
5979/0:Perfect.  The Regional Director will think that my shop had a hand in the decision.  Let  me give you a look at those weapon mods I mentioned.  I have an Ammo Scavenger, a Fragmentary Rounds Mod, and a Glass Destabilizer.  I got them off an Omar who was crucified at the end of the street.  Gruesome scene.  The work of Templars, I'm sure.
5980/0:There a contract out on me or something?
5980/1:Just do it, then!
5980/2:Is this some kind of joke?
5981/0:You better beat it.
5982/0:Stop it, and I mean bloody stop it.
5982/1:Quit, you bleedin' yob.
5982/2:That's it -- push your luck.
5983/0:It will be interesting to see whether the world powers will fund our re-organization, or whether they will decide that it's time to beef up their own forces.
5984/0:I've plum had it!
5984/1:I'm not warning you again.
5984/2:Enough of your faffing.  I mean it!
5984/3:Just try that again, Ace.
5985/0:Gave me a fright there...
5985/1:Hope you got that out of your system.
5985/2:Arse it up, why don'cha?  It's all the same to me.
5986/0:Not now!
5986/1:Hold on!
5987/0:I appreciate that.  Listen, I'm serious.  You didn't hear the explosions?  I saw a guard killed right in front of me on the apartment level.
5988/0:Ay up!
5988/1:'Ello.
5989/0:He was seen with a gang of local thugs linked to the Knights Templar.  He did a little moonlighting after the Tarsus raid by coordinating a prison-break.
5990/0:
5991/0:'Ello.
5991/1:Likewise, friend.
5992/0:There's nothing wrong with being human.  Apparently, you lost sight of that long ago.
5993/0:You sure?
5994/0:Out of order.
5995/0:I hope the chief okays a search of Flight Bay 24.  I just have a feeling about that shipment.
5996/0:In Cairo, maybe so.  I've been trying to reach Trier, Germany, our last hidden base, but all lines are down.  I found out that the leader of that cell is a man named Tracer Tong.  He's the only one who can contact JC.  If you insist on tracking down our leaders, you can hire a pilot at the Pequod's on Level 107 and go to Trier.
5997/0:Can I help you?
5998/0:Some people like to gamble.  Me?  I just like to win.
5999/0:I never thought I'd see the day when Saman would order us to let a freak pass, let alone trust one with an important mission.
6000/0:The coffee's destroyed.
6001/0:That's the only joke I can ever remember.
6002/0:
6003/0:I don't run things anymore.  Talk to the Director.
6004/0:If you really want to talk to students, you should try somewhere without teachers around.
6005/0:I don't have time for these trifles!
6005/1:This shouldn't take long.
6006/0:
6007/0:Purity is a law of Heaven.  Challenge me and you will burn in holy fire!
6007/1:Just another germ...
6008/0:
6009/0:I've faced worse trials...
6010/0:Enough!  I am Luminon Saman!  Are you INSANE?
6011/0:The machine is strong in this one...
6011/1:The frail human form is deceiving...
6012/0:A formidable enemy.
6012/1:Surprisingly resilient...
6013/0:Fair enough.  Please, don't let me interrupt your work.
6014/0:A machine-human like none I've ever encountered...
6015/0:I could use a few EMP grenades.  Give me those.  [200]
6016/0:(grunt)
6016/1:(grunt)
6017/0:(groan)
6017/1:(groan) Enough of this!
6018/0:(groan) I suppose you expected that to finish me off.
6018/1:(groan) This is far from over...
6019/0:I'll call the bank in the morning.
6020/0:Try your luck over there.
6021/0:The scab ran off that way, far as I know.
6022/0:Sorry.
6022/1:Wish I could help.
6023/0:Not me, fool!
6024/0:You tempt my patience...
6024/1:You there -- stop!  
6025/0:Germs!  More germs!  Keep away from me!
6025/1:Are you bumping into me on purpose?  Please stop.
6026/0:I will not suffer an inquisition from the likes of you...
6026/1:Keep your craven looks to yourself.
6026/2:I believe you're staring.
6027/0:You dare provoke me?
6028/0:You wouldn't harm a Luminon of the Order Church, would you?
6028/1:One scratch on me, and it's your life!
6029/0:Go this instant!
6029/1:Go!  Don't make me use force.
6030/0:We can't just walk away from this.
6031/0:Match 8!  Back by popular request -- Gob-zilla!  Today's unlucky challenger -- Snake-eyes!  Buy-in is the house minimum.  [100 credits.]  Odds are four-to-one against the Snake.
6032/0:We should leave.
6033/0:I'm Lin-May Chen, High Augur to Her Holiness.  We can't protect you in Upper Seattle.  You will have to come to our church, then we can talk more.
6034/0:A new program?
6035/0:I might be able to restore your security.
6036/0:This job doesn't pay all that good, but you see all kinds of people.
6037/0:
6038/0:Leila was the first of us "scabs" to go to the Tarsus Academy in the arcology.
6039/0:Cheerio!  I'm booked until after the summit, but maybe we'll fly again.  I'll be around.
6040/0:Certainly not.  I live here in Trier.  Seekers here don't care very much for this notion of a summit.
6041/0:I'm ready.
6042/0:(groan)
6043/0:(groan) Save me, Baphomet...
6044/0:We may differ from your kind, but we do not deserve this caging.  We are not beasts to be used for science.
6045/0:(groan) I cannot possibly fall to one of YOU...
6046/0:(gasp) (cough)
6047/0:(scream)
6048/0:(groan) I'm blind!
6049/0:Were you trying to hurt me?  (laughs)  How impolite.
6049/1:Didn't feel a thing.  Frustrating, isn't it?
6050/0:(moan)
6051/0:I changed my mind.
6052/0:(grunt)  Impossible!  (groan)
6053/0:(grunt)
6054/0:Obey me, fool.
6054/1:I have given you fair warning!
6055/0:Last warning.
6055/1:Defy me at your own peril!
6056/0:By the Skull of Sidon, I will bury you!
6057/0:It's a shame.
6058/0:Let's resign ourselves to each other's company, shall we?
6058/1:You make for an inconstant ally.
6058/2:Better now?  Or should I be on my guard?
6059/0:Not now, fool!
6060/0:That's more like it!
6061/0:No!  That's not what I meant to do...
6062/0:Hello.
6062/1:Good wishes, friend.
6063/0:My child...  // a priest blessing his flock
6063/1:Hello, my friend.
6063/2:Yes -- hello.
6064/0:That way.
6065/0:No idea, I'm afraid.
6066/0:Bosh!  Let's rip.
6067/0:They wanted me to infiltrate the flight bay and murder Paul Denton.  Can you believe it?  Me?  An assassin?  And I almost did it, too!
6068/0:Yeah?  Sounds like a fair trade.  13490.  Good luck.
6069/0:I have completed my research and have identifed subjects Abana Khodair, Eeva Nassif, and Jennifer McAllister as the greatest threats to Purity.  I am prepared to terminate the abominations as soon as I receive official orders.
6070/0:(gasp)
6071/0:Now I have you!
6071/1:Say goodbye...
6071/2:Die, wretch!
6072/0:I'm quite the marksman, you know.
6072/1:A kiss from Kundalini...
6073/0:I'll tear you limb from limb!
6073/1:I will bathe my hands in your blood!
6074/0:Lovely.
6074/1:Easy enough.
6075/0:
6076/0:For thee, Baphomet.
6076/1:Purity is served...
6077/0:Away to oblivion, defiler!
6077/1:(laugh) Just another germ.  The world has already forgotten you ever lived.
6078/0:Haven't seen YOU around here before.
6079/0:Damn your luck!
6079/1:(growl)
6079/2:You slithered out of that one!
6079/3:Curse my hand!
6080/0:I will destroy you myself!
6080/1:Pray to your demons, frail one.  Death is near.
6081/0:When did you turn into such a liberal?  If people end up working crappy jobs on a plantation, it's because they're lazy.  They're lucky Pequod's employs them at all.  
6082/0:How fragile a life is, don't you agree?
6083/0:The faithless are easy to manipulate politically, and remember, the faithless are the majority.  We should not forget de Tocqueville's insight.  If a man does not submit to faith, he will desire a firm, tyrranical shape for society.
6084/0:I would be just as angry if it were my paycheck on the line every time the Order stages a "protest".
6085/0:Wait!  Is someone listening?
6086/0:... SSC buys guns on the black market?
6087/0:He probably doesn't even understand our research.  At his level, I suppose it's just a commodity to be bartered away.
6088/0:I can't afford the new price.  [250 credits]
6089/0:So some of your people have been recruited by the Templars.
6090/0:Thanks.  I will instruct my people in Seattle to cooperate fully with your investigators.
6091/0:
6092/0:
6093/0:Just wait by the case.  I'll unlock the access panel from my office.
6094/0:Well, I've turned your heart just in time.  Now...  Wait!  Must be an overload... or a self-destruct sequence.  A blast door just sealed off the only exit.  You'll be trapped unless you can kill the power with the control box on the south wall -- or destroy the exposed conduits.  I guess the technician who worked here was a little paranoid about hackers.
6095/0:
6096/0:
6097/0:No wonder they fix prices at headquarters.  They have a worldwide monopoly.
6098/0:Tax evasion, I'm pretty sure.  That small-time cheat probably keeps his books in his office on the second floor.  Bring me hard evidence against VOX, and I'll hand over a generous Citizen's Bonus.  [500 credits.]  How's that?
6099/0:Ah yes, it appears Kurzcec has found us another customer.
6100/0:I will bury you, Seed of Proteus...
6100/1:They made your kind to be killers -- you have no claim among the living...
6100/2:Come.  Death will be your baptism.
6101/0:Yes, your spirit weakens...
6102/0:Perfect.  One more blow for Purity...
6103/0:It's scared.  The clever machine believes in death...
6103/1:No grave for you.  We grind modified bodies into dust to kill the invisible machines.
6104/0:You left Headmaster Archer alive -- an admirable show of restraint.  You should notify the SSC about him so that they can take care of the situation.  There is a security kiosk on this level outside the school.
6105/0:(grunt)
6105/1:(grunt)
6106/0:Oh!  (laugh)  A grenade...
6107/0:Bomb's away... (laugh)
6108/0:Think I'm going to walk straight into a prox mine...?  // incredulous
6109/0:You lost soul.  With the destruction of Denton's machine, the Templar plan to release a nanite predator into the atmosphere is finished.  Don't expect to leave the island alive.
6110/0:What's wrong with this door?!  // furious
6111/0:(grunt)
6112/0:We will provide civilization with only the best leadership.
6113/0:Sorry.
6114/0:Just a minute.  I'm not quite ready.
6115/0:I never said I'd fire you.  I just said that we're losing money over this and I may have to let someone go afterwards...   
6116/0:I like to travel.  Any mysteries you want solved in New Cairo?
6117/0:Primary objective:  Guard premises, admit only Alex D.
6118/0:EVERYONE wants to steal my paintings.  Especially the third-rate artists whose proposals I put straight into the recycling bin.
6119/0:What's this in my way?!  // furious
6120/0:Hmmm.  Not safe.
6121/0:I'll take the prox mines. [600]
6122/0:I give the orders...  
6122/1:chaos and more chaos...
6122/2:... faith in Purity -- nothing more is required...
6122/3:Away with these trepidations!
6123/0:(yawn)
6123/1:(cough)
6123/2:(clears throat)
6124/0:(grumble)
6125/0:Is that what you do?  Go from city to city looking for one person?
6126/0:We should be back to normal operations shortly.
6127/0:EVERYONE wants to steal my paintings.  Especially the third-rate artists whose proposals I put straight into the recycling bin.
6128/0:The Tarsus Academy on Level 107 will be accepting new applications starting next month.  The Arcology Chairman promises more city funding which means more opportunity for all.
6129/0:He's a very busy man, but always has time for parents, especially those such as yourself.  I can just tell your child must be a star student.
6130/0:You aren't so special anymore, Denton.  Maybe you remember Billie Adams.
6131/0:None of that.
6131/1:Oh?
6132/0:You got this coming.
6132/1:Nobody hits and just walks away.
6133/0:
6134/0:You dare touch a holy man?
6134/1:Keep your distance!
6135/0:You're disrupting my meditations.
6135/1:Leave me.
6136/0:People can't remember to keep that door closed.
6137/0:Really!  Enough of that.
6137/1:Peace, my child.  Peace.
6137/2:I wouldn't advise you do that.
6138/0:What's that?
6138/1:Hm.
6139/0:You better not be backing out.
6140/0:This is a weird school, using transgenics for class.
6141/0:People can't remember to leave that door open.
6142/0:Talk to Metro Man over there.
6143/0:Next time, try a key.  Sheesh.
6144/0:Oh yeah?  I heard something about that.
6145/0:I think I saw something.
6145/1:Wassat?  I can't see exactly...
6146/0:This is harassment.
6147/0:If you put it that way.  We don't want another Collapse.  What you can do for us is follow up on your discovery at the Minister of Culture's penthouse.  Check out the Mako lab north of town.  We know they've been doing illegal weapons research and that your former trainer, Dr. Nassif, has contacts there.  You'll need to hire a pilot and leave at once.
6148/0:Within our protective barrier is a cozy cafe atmosphere as sealed and secure as any WTO arcology.
6149/0:No thanks.
6150/0:Name and business, please.
6151/0:I think I'm one of her favorites.
6152/0:
6153/0:Disruption continues.
6153/1:Strange.  It just happened again.
6154/0:I heard something.
6154/1:That noise.
6155/0:I may have just seen something.
6155/1:Indeterminate visual data...
6156/0:It returns to my attention.
6156/1:My interest is sparked once more.
6157/0:Nothing to concern myself with.
6157/1:Returns to normal.
6158/0:The intruder seems to have fled.
6158/1:Trespasser is now gone.
6159/0:I can see that.
6159/1:Definitely saw something there.
6160/0:The perpetrator of violence has disappeared.
6160/1:Hm.  The area seems clear of violent suspects.
6161/0:The killer has departed.
6161/1:Threat of murder has passed.
6162/0:I'm not deaf.
6162/1:That noise...
6163/0:It appears the thief is gone.
6163/1:The burglary suspect has departed.
6164/0:This bears some investigation.
6164/1:I should take a closer look.
6165/0:I felt something there.
6165/1:What am I bumping into here?
6166/0:I'm ready.
6167/0:Stars?
6168/0:(grunt) Is someone messing with me?
6168/1:(groan) Great.  I've got some joker playing games.
6169/0:She was a liar and a fake.  And so are you.
6170/0:A concerned citizen.
6171/0:Hang on, I've got to make some room.
6172/0:Maybe you're right.  Dumier and his blackguards have had a free hand for far too long.
6173/0:No!
6173/1:What?!
6173/2:What's going on?!
6174/0:No!
6174/1:What?!
6174/2:What's going on?!
6175/0:You want it quick, you get in it.  Come on, y'all, you wanted a bonus?  There's your bonus right there.
6176/0:All I need you to do is finish off the Denton brothers.  The world doesn't need any new gods.
6177/0:No additional items for sale.
6178/0:I'm confident that I have nothing to fear from JC Denton.
6179/0:Citizens should be prepared for random searches while travelling Trier's streets.  Thank you for your cooperation.
6180/0:Hmmm... I guess Headmaster Archer can be pretty harsh.
6181/0:I'm heading up a strike team -- a military operation.  Mr. Dumier must have decided that I'm expendable.
6182/0:Here you go.  My mom said this map would get me in trouble.  Boy, was she wrong.
6183/0:You sure you locked up?
6184/0:He wants more money?  Where the hell are my weapons?
6185/0:It is known that the city is suffering from some sort of disintegrative explosion... nanotech is suspected.  An excessively high mortality rate is expected.  No known organization has yet taken responsibility for the attack.
6186/0:Damn!  Green Dragon was my second-best fighter...
6187/0:
6188/0:Hi.  I'm NG Resonance.  Hurry!  Come to my concert near the Pequod's coffeeshop!
6189/0:So much for their summit... heh heh
6190/0:A body!
6190/1:Someone's been attacked!
6191/0:A body!
6191/1:Someone's been attacked!
6192/0:A dead body!
6192/1:Someone's been killed!
6193/0:...a responsibility to share my research with the rest of the scientific community and humankind at large.
6194/0:A dead body!
6194/1:Someone's been killed!
6195/0:What is THAT?!
6195/1:I hope someone cleans that mess up...
6196/0:I think I understand NG, you know?  She's a lot like me.
6197/0:What is THAT?!
6197/1:I hope someone cleans that mess up...
6198/0:Go.  Time is short.
6199/0:It's a trick!
6199/1:Someone's messing with me.
6200/0:It's a trick!
6200/1:Someone's messing with me.
6201/0:Oh no!  Blood.  That's a bad sign.
6202/0:Your evidence?
6203/0:How stupid do you think we are?  Every day we hear the Order accuse Panzerwerks of poisoning the river.
6204/0:Oh no!  Blood.  That's a bad sign.
6205/0:A Templar-run facility in Flight Bay 24 on arcology Level 110 has a number of classified programs -- most importantly, a body-armor project for Templar Paladins.  Also, a counter-agent to the pollution that causes Plague 11 has been invented, though its deployment has been inexplicably delayed.
6206/0:Yeah, I'm working for the WTO.
6207/0:I prefer friendly ones, sweets, but I guess I'll take what I can get.  I'll meet you outside the tavern.
6208/0:You hurt all you encounter, our colony and JC.  You must be destroyed.
6209/0:Sorry.  No access to the Black Gate without the proper clearance.
6210/0:I understand.
6211/0:Good.  Helios is already configuring the new Acquinas hub.  Now come to the Statue.  I need a direct interface with your biomodifications in order to structure Helios properly.  To be the center of a civilization, an electronic mind must mirror the intelligences of the citizens.  We will be the models.
6212/0:Wonder how that blaze got started...
6213/0:Talk to Commander Maxwell, it's not up to me who can travel and who can't.
6214/0:Wonder how that blaze got started...
6215/0:Never seen 'Zilla fight?  You're in for a treat.
6216/0:Someone needs to work on their aim.
6217/0:Someone needs to work on their aim.
6218/0:Is someone throwing things?  
6219/0:It just seems too surreal-- that the WTO and Order were fictions all along.
6220/0:Is someone throwing things?  
6221/0:Perhaps you want a black-market biomod canister, which enables non-Piezochem functionality.  I'm also selling three gas grenades, which deliver a biotoxin irritant in gaseous form.  I've also got an ammo clip, which provides universal ammunition for all weapons.  As a preferred customer, you may purchase items at half-market price.
6222/0:Hm... Wonder where it is.
6223/0:I found out that the missing Tarsus children were just playing a prank.
6224/0:Hm... Wonder where it is.
6225/0:Who left this here?
6226/0:Who left this here?
6227/0:
6228/0:I don't have the people in Seattle to stop you, I suppose.  Disobey the WTO again, however, and you will regret it.
6229/0:Now I can settle up with the Omar.  They're my biggest client.
6230/0:I told you:  We can't trust Tarsus or the WTO.  You really should come to our church and hear what the Order has to say.  Her Holiness will open your eyes. May She watch over you.
6231/0:You're startin' to push your luck.
6232/0:A remarkable achievement.  You do not even comprehend today's significance for the future of this planet, or whose interests you may have served, but you have our gratitude.  A discount will be applied to all of your business transactions with our agents, anywhere in the world.
6233/0:What do YOU want?
6234/0:You're a pro, Alex.  You're inside and Mako doesn't know what hit 'em.
6235/0:When you have eliminated the threat and spoken to JC, go outside to the abandoned VersaLife base.  You will need to turn on the pilot beacon so that I can land safely and take you to your next destination.
6236/0:I have orders to let you pass, but I don't like it.
6237/0:What happened to it?
6238/0:What happened to it?
6239/0:Well that's totally wrecked now.
6240/0:What for?  I think I'd find more work in Europe.
6241/0:You should leave while you can.
6242/0:Tarsus Academy:  Preparing the next generation for the world.
6243/0:Well that's totally wrecked now.
6244/0:That sure is acting weird.
6245/0:Versalife established an outpost here and set us on the ice to test our reactions to extreme conditions.  We were the next generation of a project launched in Roswell.  We were to be unstoppable ground troops, unfazed by cold or radiation.  In other cases, our DNA was to be harvested to create biomodifications for humans, so that they could survive the aftermath of a nuclear war.
6246/0:That sure is acting weird.
6247/0:Why would this be shut down?
6248/0:Why would this be shut down?
6249/0:You sound like you know something I don't.
6250/0:That should be closed.
6251/0:Well done, Alex.  Paul will join me on Liberty Island.  I have constructed a machine that will populate the atmosphere with the particles that make up our biomod architecture.  I may need your help against a force of Templars that has intervened.  More when you arrive.  Contact your pilot with the Flight Bay 23 beacon.  Don't worry about Paul -- I will arrange for his extraction.
6252/0:That should be closed.
6253/0:We're waiting for reinforcements and our own mech detachment before we move in.  This is way more firepower than we're prepared to deal with, especially with our resources focused at HQ.  But if you can take care of a milbot on your own, be my guest.
6254/0:My parents warned me about becoming an artist.  Then they cut me off.
6255/0:I don't need you, Alex.  I can restore Aquinas myself.  I just sent my commandos into UNATCO to make sure you don't transmit the protocol data to the wrong place.
6256/0:I thought the students were being evacuated.
6257/0:Got it.
6258/0:Tourists are not welcome here.
6259/0:
6259/1:
6260/0:Why not get rid of nanotech and genetic engineering, the technologies that make people different from each other?
6261/0:I'm a corporal, and I'm sending you to guard the ramp.
6262/0:Gotta keep walking this same crappy beat.
6263/0:I'll keep my word.  A nice bounty for Mr. VIP cyborg.
6264/0:How'd that get closed?
6265/0:How'd that get closed?
6266/0:I found Her Holiness.  Turns out she was Nicolette DuClare -- an Illuminatus.
6267/0:Who turned this on?
6268/0:Who turned this on?
6269/0:Do me a favor.  Try to understand what this confilct is about before you attack anybody else.
6270/0:Splendid.  Here's your money.  I knew you were the type when you walked in the front door.
6271/0:It's off?  Weird.
6272/0:It's off?  Weird.
6273/0:I wanted you to see more evidence that the program is corrupt.  We weren't their proteges --  just their guinea pigs.  That's why I joined the Order.
6274/0:Local hops.  All you want for a day.  [750 credits.]
6275/0:Let's make this a quick one.
6275/1:Okay paladins, eyes open.
6276/0:Where'd this thing come from?
6277/0:This stuff at Tarsus today just proves my point -- The Order needs to be banned from WTO grounds.
6278/0:Where'd this thing come from?
6279/0:A world in their own image, perhaps, one that wouldn't include ApostleCorp.  They categorically oppose all biomod technologies.  We think they might have staged the Chicago attack merely to ensure that our laboratory was destroyed.
6280/0:You have been deceived, tired pilgrim.  I destroyed the entire city of Chicago only because the threat from ApostleCorp warranted such desperate tactics.  Come to the holocomm in Tent 04.  It's time you learned the truth about your past.
6281/0:The sicker you get, the harder it is not to believe.  You want to believe you can think the pain away...
6282/0:Hard to say.  Maybe an hour.
6283/0:The Mosque is a weapons-free zone.  To enter, you must submit to a deactivation procedure --  I'll transmit the encrypted safety-lock bytecodes to freeze all your weapons, in or on your person.  Upon your departure, sensors will reactivate everything you've got.
6284/0:Hey!  I live here!
6285/0:Good thing there's two of us.  We can watch each other's backs.
6286/0:Billie and I are from Old Chicago.  We had sector passes to go to the Tarsus school in the New Chicago enclave.  I guess all of that's gone now.  Billie and I -- we always planned to send money home once we got assigned.
6287/0:It's plain as day if you take two seconds to think about it
6288/0:See if you can come up with some money then.
6289/0:It's ridiculous that anyone still buys low-tech QueeQuechinos, when they could have bioenhanced drinks like ours.
6290/0:Back to downtown.
6291/0:Hopefully we'll get a bit more mileage out of you than we did from that Adams chick.
6292/0:I know what I want to do now.
6293/0:Hang in there!
6293/1:Don't be a hero!
6294/0:Hang in there!
6294/1:Don't be a hero!
6295/0:Don't worry -- I'll get him!
6296/0:Don't worry -- I'll get him!
6297/0:I really thought this summit would let us do something about terrorism.  Oh well.
6298/0:It's jammed.
6299/0:Don't worry -- I'll get her!
6300/0:Yes...
6301/0:It's jammed.
6302/0:Don't worry -- I'll get her!
6303/0:(grunt) Gotta move this...
6304/0:If you're gonna run, RUN!
6304/1:Keep your head!
6304/2:Wait!  I can't do this by myself!
6305/0:I heard that the summit has been delayed.
6306/0:(grunt) Gotta move this...
6307/0:If you're gonna run, RUN!
6307/1:Keep your head!
6307/2:Wait!  I can't do this by myself!
6308/0:What next?
6309/0:Yes.  Missionaries.
6310/0:Right now we're expanding production, so we're looking for new faces.  You might be the next Vice-manager in charge of servo-receptors or Armor Arc-Welder Technician 3.  Submit your application today.
6311/0:Whoa -- I'm not going in THERE.
6312/0:Fire in the hole!
6313/0:What's going on?  Why am I the one being questioned?  I just escaped from a raid on Tarsus.
6314/0:Whoa -- I'm not going in THERE.
6315/0:Fire in the hole!
6316/0:I give up.  You don't have a clue what to believe in, do you?  One extreme and then another.  When I kill you, what will you have died for?
6317/0:I think I cut him... see any blood?
6317/1:He's breathing.  Hear that?
6317/2:Run him down.
6318/0:You've done well so far.  Just don't let me down.
6319/0:She isn't finished.
6319/1:Run her down.
6319/2:She's breathing.  Hear that?
6320/0:What are your scientists going to do with Paul Denton?
6321/0:
6321/1:
6321/2:
6321/3:
6321/4:
6321/5:
6321/6:
6321/7:
6321/8:
6321/9:
6322/0:Almost gotcha...
6322/1:Steady... steady...
6323/0:
6324/0:You've already seen the lab, so I guess it won't hurt anything for you to install a few biomods.  You'll be needing them.
6325/0:Our sacred goal, the elevation of humankind, can only be accomplished in secrecy.
6326/0:The defense of the compound is in your hands.  If you can hold the facility, and if my mission is a success, we should be ready to begin our offensive against WTO enclaves by the end of the month.
6327/0:Perhaps you're right.  May She forgive my doubt.  I grew up in post-Collapse Hong Kong.  My parents were Max Chen and Maggie Chow, conspirators involved wirh MJ-12.  My worst fear is that I'll give my allegiance to a deceptive cause.  May Order prevail.
6328/0:I know the Order came here to have a peaceful summit, but they had to know that a riot was possible.
6329/0:Work with us, Alex.  If you show me I can trust you, I am prepared to privelege you like the son I never had.
6330/0:I'm Bud Puckett.  Remember me?
6331/0:They can do what they want, I guess.  I can't believe that Tarsus is a front -- after all those years of training.
6332/0:Here you go.  Name's Alex D.  [250 credits.]
6333/0:Saman has taken an interest in you.  He insisted that we let you live.
6334/0:No active weapons in the Greasel Pit. First I gotta transmit the safety-lock codes to freeze anything you're carrying.  Then I let you in.  Otherwise, take a hike.
6335/0:Why me?  Are you sure you've got the right person?
6336/0:You'd think someone would've seen this coming and warned us... maybe made a contingency plan....
6337/0:The workers?!  They just want a production bonus, but now they get nothing because the Seekers' sabotage has pushed them off schedule.
6338/0:Saman's a serious man.  In a year he'll be running the world.  To do that requires more than grunts like us.  He'll need infrastructure.  I think that's what this is all about.
6339/0:So I've sworn an oath to exterminate defilers of the race.
6340/0:The last century was ruled by progress and novelty for their own sake.  This one has a chance to be ruled by purpose.
6341/0:This'll shake him up.
6342/0:I don't have a problem with you being here.  Just be careful.
6343/0:This'll shake him up.
6344/0:This'll shake her up.
6345/0:I'm almost afraid to leave my house.  Those horrible pictures from Chicago -- did you see them?  And our own security breakdown here in Seattle with Tarsus and the Inclinator.
6346/0:This'll shake her up.
6347/0:Must've gotten sick.  Probably some rich guy, expects to be cured by "future technology."
6348/0:Grenade!
6348/1:It's gonna blow!
6349/0:
6350/0:Grenade!
6350/1:It's gonna blow!
6351/0:I'm sending in a bot.
6352/0:Huh.  An explosive.
6353/0:Thanks.  Now SSC will know to send in a rescue team. 
6354/0:Good luck.
6355/0:I'm sending in a bot.
6356/0:Huh.  An explosive.
6357/0:I'm calling for a bot.
6358/0:Don't trip the prox mine.
6359/0:I'm calling for a bot.
6360/0:Don't trip the prox mine.
6361/0:It was an accident.  Weapon malfunction.
6362/0:Okay, I'm Eeva.  And people SHOULD be worried.  We were poking around the Headmaster's office one day, and found this secret room.  From the looks of it, he's plotting something horrible for some of the students here.
6363/0:Where to?
6364/0:Welcome to the Order sanctuary for this city, Alex D.  We've been expecting you.
6365/0:test.
6366/0:Let me warn you, friend -- we consider the modified to be less than human.  Observe what your Second Soul of nanites has done to you -- and consider going to a clinic to be Purified.
6367/0:What can I say?  We all have our taste in coffee.
6368/0:We never hurt anyone, just the machines.
6369/0:Did the Templars use the portal?  How could they, unless one of the other trainees --
6370/0:I think I'll stay outside rather than catch any more heat for today's fiasco.
6371/0:I guess those Templars won't be completing their mission.
6372/0:Thank you, Chief Morgan.
6373/0:Thanks.
6374/0:Help!
6374/1:I need backup!
6375/0:You're listed as the investigator who opened a criminal probe into Tarsus Academy.
6376/0:Help!
6376/1:I need backup!
6377/0:Someone get him!
6378/0:Hurry up.  This could mean my job.
6379/0:A remarkable achievement.  You do not even comprehend today's significance for the future of this planet, but you have our gratitude.  A discount will be applied to all of your business transactions with our agents, anywhere in the world.
6380/0:Someone get him!
6381/0:You sure you don't want to be alone with the sculptor?
6382/0:Apartment?  Oh, that one.  Already leased.  Sorry.
6383/0:I didn't feel a thing.
6383/1:You're not even trying!
6384/0:Someone get her!
6385/0:I get the idea.
6386/0:I didn't feel a thing.
6386/1:You're not even trying!
6387/0:Someone get her!
6388/0:Do not think this means all is forgiven.  I just need the credits.
6389/0:(grunt)
6389/1:(grunt) I've been hit!
6389/2:(grunt) Help! I've been hurt!
6390/0:I'm tougher than I look.
6390/1:This is just my day job.
6390/2:How's it hangin'?
6391/0:(grunt) ... maybe I'm in over my head here...
6391/1:(grunt) ... not sure how much more I can take.
6392/0:I'd buy the door code off you, but I don't have the funds.  [250 credits.]
6393/0:(grunt) This is really starting to take it's toll.
6393/1:(grunt) I... haven't got much left.
6394/0:I can't find a job in the medina and I can't get a work-pass for the arcology.
6395/0:So it's haunted.  Nothing but death ever came out of that place.
6396/0:I'm on fire!
6396/1:It burns!
6397/0:Hey, Jack.  Listen up.  Wanna scrip' some REAL cash?  You look like the mercenary type.
6398/0:I'm on fire!
6398/1:It burns!
6399/0:Well, they only let me go as far as the storage closet, but for the right price I could give you the code to the front door.
6400/0:Living in the medina is not always easy, but the Order brings me much peace.
6401/0:We'll try to overlook your betrayal at the Mako facility if you help us find Dr. Nassif.  She comes from a poor family in the plague-stricken village outside the arcology walls.  You'll have to make your way to Level 108.  Billie is waiting for you in the mosque that separates the New Cairo arcology from the village.  She'll be coordinating the operation.
6402/0:I was bluffing, Alex.  You didn't need to go to so much trouble.  What kind of person do you think I am?
6403/0:Too bad I'm leaving this place just as the crud's getting vacuumed out of the air.
6404/0:Emerald Suites pays a premium bonus for catching crooks.
6405/0:I still don't like being spied on.
6406/0:You will not last long without protection.
6407/0:Let's rip.
6408/0:We were watching that facility ourselves.  Ever heard of an organization code-named ApostleCorp?
6409/0:One scratch on her, and someone's gonna pay.
6410/0:Give me a rain check?
6411/0:Whoa... that's not right...  MAD BOT!!!
6411/1:That bot's been hacked!
6412/0:You're not going to get away with that!
6412/1:Your turn, jackass.
6412/2:Murderer!  You're the reason they let us shoot people, you know.
6413/0:Modified and everything!  You LIKE killing, don't you? 
6414/0:You memorize the phrase "separation of powers" in school, but in the beginning no one was exactly sure how to pull it off.
6415/0:(moan) I don't feel so good.
6415/1:(moan) Oh no -- I think that was poison...
6416/0:I can't see!
6416/1:I've been blinded!
6417/0:Is this entire facility for studying us -- the trainees?  Was I under the microscope in Chicago, too?
6418/0:I can't see!
6418/1:I've been blinded!
6419/0:Oh God...
6419/1:Tell my family I love them.
6419/2:It's all going dark...
6420/0:We still do not know who is responsible, but the totality of the destruction leads many to wonder whether this may signal the beginning of yet another Collapse.
6421/0:Oh God...
6421/1:Tell my family I love them.
6421/2:It's all going dark...
6422/0:(moan)
6422/1:(groan)
6422/2:(grunt)
6423/0:(moan)
6423/1:(groan)
6423/2:(grunt)
6424/0:(grunt) Everything's spinning...
6424/1:(grunt) Slipping away...
6424/2:(grunt)
6425/0:If you have business here, speak with Miss Sak.  Otherwise, please depart.
6426/0:(grunt) Everything's spinning...
6426/1:(grunt) Slipping away...
6426/2:(grunt)
6427/0:And Mako Ballistics is reporting that terrorists have infiltrated their Redmond facility and have stolen the plans for a weapon prototype.
6428/0:(laugh)  Just kiddin', babe.
6429/0:Under my guidance, Helios has restructured itself to synthesize and redistribute information freely.  It will become the collective consciousness of the human race.
6430/0:He offered to meet with Order high-priestess Her Holiness for talks designed to ease misunderstanding between the two groups.
6431/0:No one has yet claimed responsibility for the attack on Chicago.  We don't know with any certainty whether it was an accident, an ideological strike against the WTO enclave there, or something else.  Fortunately, we were able to evacuate the trainees there.  They will be joining us at this location and you will be meeting them shortly.  We appreciate your patience during this stressful period.
6432/0:Your nanites are a feat of engineering and evolution.
6433/0:You don't want all the details in one dose -- trust me.  First pick up your map to the facility.  It's stored in a datacube inside the chest.  Then I'll unlock your door and tell you what I can about the disaster.
6434/0:Ah yes.  He told me you were coming.  The door code is 23489.
6435/0:Are their legs frozen or something?
6436/0:We should get moving.
6437/0:We will transact again.
6438/0:I don't believe it... my best fighter...  killed by a spoon-fed rookie.
6439/0:
6440/0:Don't fire until you see those purple eyes...
6441/0:Things sure have been crazy around here lately.
6442/0:No more excuses about your grandfather.  The plague is gone.  Look at the sky!
6443/0:... danger... the enemy... very close...
6444/0:Hi, there.
6445/0:Ask Dr. Nassif.  I'm just a trainee -- they moved me here a couple weeks ago.
6446/0:At least you're safe.  If I can do anything to make you feel more at home, let me know.
6447/0:Roger.
6447/1:10-4.
6447/2:You got it.
6448/0:Roger.
6448/1:10-4.
6448/2:You got it.
6449/0:(groan) ... my feet.
6449/1:... never ends...
6449/2:... lookin' good...
6449/3:I'd rather be reviewing the new regulations.
6449/4:When everyone wakes up and joins the WTO, there will be fewer patrols.
6449/5:Wonder who I ticked off to get this assignment.
6450/0:(groan) ... my feet.
6450/1:... never ends...
6450/2:... lookin' good...
6450/3:I'd rather be reviewing the new regulations.
6450/4:When everyone wakes up and joins the WTO, there will be fewer patrols.
6450/5:Wonder who I ticked off to get this assignment.
6450/6:Dad was right -- I made the cut.
6450/7:A ten-mile run -- no better way to relax.
6450/8:By now, I must be in line for a promotion...
6450/9:She'd be impressed if she knew I qualified as a marksman...
6450/10:Gotta keep awake.  Maybe some caffeine would help...
6450/11:Big guns and a cool uniform -- what else do I need? 
6450/12:Am I starting to get a beer gut?
6450/13:I have to cut back on the late night candy bars...
6450/14:They'll think twice before messing with me.
6451/0:He was quite the gentleman, actually.  I have everything I need.
6452/0:I said MOVE!
6453/0:Upon the arrival of the key, JC was to be awakened, to welcome the perfected genetic code.  Then he and Paul were to share it with the world. Now, there is much unexpected violence -- even you threaten our survival -- but we will proceed according to the original Plan. 
6454/0:I've heard stories about The Collapse.  They scared me.
6455/0:Where do you want to go?
6456/0:What you discovered could be more important.  We now know that we face a network of scientists called ApostleCorp.  It's hard to believe that they have agents inside the weapons lab.
6457/0:State your name and business.
6458/0:I do not expect to have my inventory replenished for a while, unfortunately.
6459/0:Thank goodness my daughter is safe, at least for now.  Because of you, she was able to escape the arcology just in time.
6460/0:I will notify my friend at the morgue.   Mmm, lovely.  The Omar are hungry for another sweet-meat surprise...
6461/0:Thanks.
6462/0:... cooped up all day...
6463/0:... cooped up all day...
6464/0:When we have you safe inside another Tarsus facility.  We can no longer protect ourselves in North America.
6465/0:It's freezing out here.
6465/1:... leave me out here to freeze to death.
6465/2:(shiver)  brrrr...
6466/0:It's freezing out here.
6466/1:... leave me out here to freeze to death.
6466/2:(shiver)  brrrr...
6467/0:... soaked to the bone...
6467/1:Shoulda brought a raincoat.
6468/0:Doesn't look that way to me.
6469/0:... soaked to the bone...
6469/1:Shoulda brought a raincoat.
6470/0:Nice day, at least. 
6471/0:Sid Black.  How'd you end up in Trier?
6472/0:Nice day, at least. 
6473/0:Nah -- they don't mind if you hang out in the chapel, as long as you don't fall asleep.  Man, did I find THAT out the hard way.
6474/0:(sigh)
6474/1:(singing)
6474/2:(yawn)
6474/3:(grumble)
6474/4:(cough)
6474/5:(sneeze)
6475/0:It would be unsafe for me to approach any closer to the Mako Ballistics campus.  You will have to bypass the facility's defenses on your own.
6476/0:The WTO's surveillance policies are spelled out in the Charter, in case you have any questions.  Please report your findings on Tarsus to the local SSC office, located on Level 108.  They're authorized to disburse a reward.
6477/0:(sigh)
6477/1:(singing)
6477/2:(yawn)
6477/3:(grumble)
6477/4:(cough)
6477/5:(sneeze)
6478/0:So you see yourself as a god?
6479/0:For the first time in decades, meteorologists are detecting a dissipation in Nanite Swell 11.  In the history of the fourteen nanite pollution clouds globally, no natural disintegration has ever been observed.  
6480/0:
6481/0:A shower, a new suit of clothes, and you can't tell the terrorists from the people who LIVE here.
6482/0:Ever think about a job in Inclinator Maintenance?  It's a growing field.
6483/0:Oh...
6484/0:To find a monster, you've got to be a monster, apparently.  We were too pure to track him down, but she sniffed him out immediately.
6485/0:Invalid password.
6486/0:(grunt) Watch it!
6486/1:(grunt) Hey, I'm one of you!
6487/0:(grunt) Watch it!
6487/1:(grunt) Hey, I'm one of you!
6488/0:Watch it.
6488/1:No funny business, now.
6489/0:Watch it.
6489/1:No funny business, now.
6489/2:Don't touch me.
6489/3:Watch it.
6489/4:Ow!  I'm not amused...
6490/0:Hey, guy, watch where you're going.
6491/0:Hey, guy, watch where you're going.
6492/0:What business did you have in the school?  You a parent?
6493/0:It's false advertising if the product doesn't exist, right?  I would very much like to see the file they have in the Evidence Room at the SSC Station.  The suit was dismissed, but they won't tell me why.  What I'd pay to know what's really going on...  [200 credits]
6494/0:Hey, lady, watch where you're going.
6495/0:Hey, lady, watch where you're going.
6496/0:Something wrong?
6496/1:What?!  // exasperated
6497/0:Something wrong?
6497/1:What?!  // exasperated
6497/2:You want something?
6497/3:Yeah?  What is it?
6497/4:What are YOU looking at?
6498/0:Today marks the one year anniversary of the Refinery Riots, protesting the incorporation of Seattle into the WTO.  Mourners held a candlelight vigil in remembrance of those killed in the chaos.
6499/0:
6500/0:Umph.  I can't see...
6500/1:Ow.  This burns...  
6501/0:Yeah?
6502/0:(grunt)
6502/1:(grunt)
6503/0:Damn it!  I'll stop you myself.
6504/0:(humming NG song like a dirge)
6504/1:At least I'm going out on top...
6504/2:They'll always remember me now.
6505/0:They cannot be so wicked as that.  No one chooses to live in the medina.
6506/0:Unggh.
6506/1:Oof.
6507/0:(gurgle)
6508/0:I can take care myself, scab.
6508/1:Don't you know who I am?  You're finished.
6509/0:(hums NG music)
6509/1:I think I need to try a new conditioner.
6509/2:I hate this lipstick.
6509/3:What was up with those shoes?
6510/0:Perhaps I can be of assistance later.
6511/0:That's my business.
6512/0:(grumble)
6512/1:(ahem)
6512/2:(cough)
6513/0:Not NOW!
6513/1:Can't talk...Kinda dangerous...
6514/0:Oops!
6514/1:Sorry!
6515/0:I deserve to be put back in the field, to tell the truth.  I proved today how little I understand the current tactical environment.
6516/0:The violence... never ends....
6517/0:You are certain of this?  Hm.  That would explain why the board's praise about the NG endorsement was so guarded.
6518/0:Give me the key to penthouse's back stairwell.
6519/0:I've got my eye on you.
6519/1:Take it easy over there.
6520/0:I'll take your word for it.
6521/0:I've got my eye on you.
6521/1:Take it easy over there.
6521/2:What's up with that?
6521/3:Bad idea.
6521/4:Excuse me.  That's a violation of the WTO charter.
6522/0:This is a WTO-policed area, mister.
6523/0:This is a WTO-policed area, mister.
6524/0:Open your eyes to the greed that surrounds us.  The pulsing traffic of numbers that shapes all power relations and makes us all into tools.  Please, friend, join our cause.  Work for Purity.  Defend the pure human being, who must be kept free from enhancement, modification, cyborg integration.
6525/0:This is a WTO-policed area, ma'am.
6526/0:This is a WTO-policed area, ma'am.
6527/0:You aren't supposed to be here.
6527/1:Quit snoopin' around.
6528/0:Sorry.  No access to the Black Gate without the proper clearance.
6529/0:You aren't supposed to be here.
6529/1:Quit snoopin' around.
6530/0:Excellent work.  That gray will surely be grateful for your bravery and kindness.
6531/0:Sorry.  No exceptions.  I can't let anyone past without the security clearance.
6532/0:Oh yeah?
6532/1:Section 040... threatening a police officer... That carries a pretty stiff sentence.
6533/0:Oh yeah?
6533/1:Section 040... threatening a police officer... That carries a pretty stiff sentence.
6534/0:First the WTO and Order sitting down for peace talks, and now the Templars taking over Cairo.  What a week.
6535/0:Yeah.  That way.
6535/1:Sure.  I'd look around over there.
6536/0:Nope.
6536/1:Sorry.
6537/0:Hey there.
6537/1:Hi.
6538/0:Hey there.
6538/1:Hi.
6539/0:I'm part of the chief's personal detachment.
6540/0:No thanks.
6540/1:Excuse me?
6541/0:Hey -- watch where you're walking.
6541/1:Stay out of my space.
6542/0:I told you before.  Protection.
6543/0:I don't think you're supposed to be here.
6543/1:This area's restricted, so you should probably move along.
6544/0:I'm all out of photos, or else I'd gladly give you one.
6544/1:My fans all gaze at me adoringly.
6545/0:You're acting kinda strange.
6545/1:I don't understand your behavior.
6546/0:Bet a hundred on Chicken-liver -- five-to-one odds, baby!
6547/0:Hey, I don't want any trouble.
6547/1:No need for violence.
6548/0:What's the status on the search for their leader?
6549/0:Thanks.
6550/0:Good talkin' to ya.
6551/0:Watch it, buddy.
6552/0:Watch it, buddy.
6553/0:Watch it, lady.
6554/0:I'll be waitin'.
6555/0:Watch it, lady.
6556/0:So the WTO wants you to steal the Mag Rail schematics.  Don't be fooled.  They will monopolize the technology for their own security forces.  The Order asks that you kill the scientist who developed the gun.  We will send Mako a message.  Such work breeds nothing but strife and suffering.
6557/0:Just keep it up...
6557/1:Hey, cut it out.
6558/0:Just keep it up...
6558/1:Hey, cut it out.
6559/0:Next time I shove you back.
6559/1:Hey, show some respect.  Jeez.
6560/0:Next time I shove you back.
6560/1:Hey, show some respect.  Jeez.
6560/2:QUIT SHOVIN'!
6560/3:Goin' for my weapon or somethin'?
6560/4:Try shoving me sometime when I'm off-duty...
6560/5:Hey, back off.
6561/0:Quit staring at me.
6561/1:I'm ordering you now.  Mind your own business.
6562/0:Quit staring at me.
6562/1:I'm ordering you now.  Mind your own business.
6562/2:Keep your funny looks to yourself.
6562/3:Are you lost or something?
6562/4:Stop gaping at me.
6563/0:Her office is across from mine, on the other side of the reception area.  You the woman with covert ops training?  You want to make my day?  Bring me the balance sheet for that dive nightclub.  VOX.  Down at the end of the block.
6564/0:
6565/0:Aw, jeez, he's doin' it again...
6566/0:Oh.  Really?
6567/0:I remember when I first heard about them -- the Order seemed all right.  Just a bunch of warm and fuzzy spiritual types.
6568/0:I might have given you a key to the gate in the courtyard, but if you'd rather fight your way through a greasel nest, I guess I can't stop you.
6569/0:Just checking up on my investment.
6570/0:I noticed that you've been doing some work for the WTO Chairman of New Cairo.
6571/0:Ouch.  That hurt.
6571/1:Ugh.  That is no way to treat a pop sensation.
6572/0:Please knock it off.
6572/1:I don't have time for this.
6573/0:Stop bumping into me.
6573/1:I'd prefer not to have physical contact with my fans.
6574/0:This area's off-limits.
6574/1:You need to move along.  You don't belong here.
6575/0:I've had it with the paparazzi watching my every move!
6575/1:You're really creeping me out with that glare.
6576/0:What kinda scab are you?
6576/1:You're not impressing me with this weird act.
6577/0:Nice.  With one Denton out of the picture, our work will be much easier.  My commandos have already secured a beachhead on the south shore of Liberty Island.  We're ready to back you up.  Contact your pilot with the Flight Bay 23 beacon.  So glad to have you with us, Alex.
6578/0:Pick on someone else.
6578/1:You'll never get away with this.  
6579/0:Ow!  Are you trying to get in the news?
6579/1:Do you want me to turn you in for assault?
6580/0:I love my fans, but I'm just about out of patience with you.
6580/1:I knew I should've hired more bodyguards...
6581/0:That's it!
6581/1:I've just about had it!
6582/0:For a pretty lady like you, the going rate minus twenty percent.  [400 credits.]
6583/0:We perform our duties without hesitation.
6584/0:Meditation also makes me a better shot.
6584/1:I have Her Holiness on my side.
6584/2:I am prepared to put an end to you.
6584/3:Your disruption will no longer be tolerated.
6584/4:You cannot win.
6584/5:Order will be served.
6585/0:Miss Withers gave me a call.  Thank you so much.  You did it!
6586/0:Meditation also makes me a better shot.
6586/1:I have Her Holiness on my side.
6586/2:I am prepared to put an end to you.
6586/3:Your disruption will no longer be tolerated.
6586/4:You cannot win.
6586/5:Order will be served.
6587/0:What?  You gonna ask me out or something?  Pwww.
6588/0:test.
6589/0:What?  You gonna ask me out or something?  Pwww.
6590/0:Yoo-hoo....  Am I invisible?
6590/1:No monkey-business now...
6591/0:Yoo-hoo....  Am I invisible?
6591/1:No monkey-business now...
6591/2:Cut it out -- that's an order.
6591/3:I'm obligated to report you for that.
6591/4:You'll stop that -- if you know what's good for you.
6592/0:Absolutely no visitors.  Go!
6592/1:I'm telling you to leave.
6593/0:Hey!  HEY!  I'm not going to sit here and -- Janice!  What's --
6594/0:Absolutely no visitors.  Go!
6594/1:I'm telling you to leave.
6595/0:You already broke the law just waving that thing at me.
6595/1:Don't tic me off.
6595/2:Put it down.  Easy.  If you're upset, maybe you should look into getting some counseling.
6596/0:Alex, the grays are no threat to you -- they are allied with JC.  He approached you in peace, in order to warn you of the situation there.  Nothing can be done now.  Just focus on gaining access to JC's sanctuary and reviving him.
6597/0:You already broke the law just waving that thing at me.
6597/1:Don't tic me off.
6597/2:Put it down.  Easy.  If you're upset, maybe you should look into getting some counseling.
6598/0:Thanks.  I'm glad I didn't have to deal with it.  I hope the director is paying you a fair wage, but in case she isn't, you might want to check out the repair bot storage closet if you haven't already.  The code's 13490.  Grab whatever you need.  You earned it.
6599/0:Oh yeah, beggar?  Do it!
6600/0:Oh yeah, beggar?  Do it!
6601/0:I charge almost double compared to QueeQueg's coffee in Lower Seattle.  Why?  Terrorism.  Taxes.  Rent....
6602/0:It isn't often that a man finds a cause worth dying for.
6603/0:Too late.  The WTO already has the schematic.  Besides, we wanted the scientist DEAD.
6604/0:I'm from the Tarsus program.  Dr. Nassif would want me to be taken back into custody.
6605/0:No problem.  You all right?
6606/0:You must be Mathers.  Your supervisor sent me to find you. 
6607/0:My mind is already working.  I think I see an opportunity, in fact.  The Pequod's manager had a black-market operation.  I could cover it up and tell management I was merely "protecting the reputation of the coffee industry."
6608/0:I'll take the master code for the apartments. [500]
6609/0:At least we're making progress.
6610/0:You have your orders.  Proceed.
6611/0:We have to get out of here.
6612/0:At least I don't feel guilty drinking Queequeg's coffee.
6613/0:Let's talk about you.
6614/0:Of my own money?
6615/0:The Order pulls one of their stunts, and what happens to the average Panzerwerks tech?  Lower pay, lower bonus, and NO job security.
6616/0:Looks like I'm going to be working overtime.
6617/0:
6618/0:Good luck, bud.
6619/0:Balance, my friend.  In these times, we need balance.
6620/0:I'm not blaming you personally...
6621/0:There are rumors about the Order -- that they are growing more extreme, like a cult.
6622/0:What needs to be done?
6623/0:
6624/0:Next we will find out that the Order and WTO are branches of the same organization.
6625/0:Er... So I guess you've heard about Eeva and Jennifer?
6626/0:Sorry, old boy.  I can't do much until I get my wings back.
6627/0:Is the procedure dangerous?
6628/0:Where will you pick me up?
6629/0:Here you go.  Name's Alex D.  [500 credits.]
6630/0:After the decimation of Chicago, the obscure motives of Her Holiness and the Order are only part of what worries security experts.  Go under the veil of the Order and you find that perhaps Disorder is a better word for this so-called unified world faith.
6631/0:To activate the Gate, you will need to turn on a backup generator on the top floor and then upload the Sequencing Module from the Gate Control Room.
6632/0:I could come right out and tell you, but how much fun would that be?
6633/0:The Hateful Ones threaten all that we have worked and waited for.
6634/0:What now?
6635/0:Oh yeah, then why don't you drink one?
6636/0:This has been another... ta-a-alk BULLET!
6637/0:Let's see... minus ten percent.  Here you go.
6638/0:
6639/0:They're going to regret treating me like they have here.
6640/0:Don't worry about me.  I'll find a way out.
6641/0:I'm glad I don't have to worry about transgenics on the loose around here anymore.
6642/0:(grunt) I can't see!
6642/1:(grunt) ...something in my eyes!
6643/0:Quite an uninhibited young fellow, aren't you?
6644/0:Gotcha.
6645/0:No more tomorrows for the scientists at the old base.
6646/0:Gotcha.
6647/0:The hazardous materials are yet to be contained, yet an unidentified woman did reactivate the Inclinator and travel through the spill. Her motives remain unknown.
6648/0:You're dead.
6649/0:As you wish.  How fortunate that we found each other.  We've both lost someone -- but now, with each other's help, maybe our luck will change.
6650/0:You're dead.
6651/0:Oh no!  You hurt my friend.
6652/0:Oh no!  You hurt my friend.
6653/0:We humans, though... we are very good at creating the supreme race, one tiny piece at a time.
6654/0:Nothing you can give me will help Paul now.  I've joined the Illuminati cause and Paul is dead.
6655/0:The survival of ApostleCorp -- and JC's hope for society -- depend on what you do in Antarctica.
6656/0:Wait here.  I'll be right back.
6657/0:Bet they aren't expecting to see Leo Jankowski.
6658/0:
6659/0:
6660/0:Vitakka... vitakka... vitakka....
6661/0:There he is -- the head scientist.  That's what you call a soft target.  Take him out.  The Order will be displeased if you fail to achieve this objective.
6662/0:Thank you again.  Perhaps we will be okay.
6663/0:That's it!  Cut the mike.  Someone.... cut the --
6664/0:You played a pretty low trick on the world, taking advantage of the Collapse to seize power, distracting people with a phony conflict between business and religion.
6665/0:Sorry.  I don't have any credits to spare.
6666/0:You killed my friend.
6666/1:(crying)
6667/0:You killed my friend.
6667/1:(crying)
6668/0:After the decimation of Chicago, the obscure motives of Her Holiness and the Order are only part of what worries security experts.  Go under the veil of the Order and you find that perhaps Disorder is a better word for this so-called unified world faith.
6669/0:That part was easy, but they're worried about a counterattack.  I asked around.  This whole operation is just to put a buffer zone around the frozen body.
6670/0:Good shot.
6671/0:...I think they were kicked out.  They disappeared right after the last biochem exam.  Maybe they were expelled for cheating?  That would explain why they were getting such high grades... 
6672/0:No more talking.
6673/0:Good shot.
6674/0:Good work.  We're safe.
6675/0:Good work.  We're safe.
6676/0:What is it?
6677/0:So de Tocqueville noted that an all-knowing mind -- the mind of God, as he conceived it -- would have no need for general ideas.  It would understand every individual in detail and at a glance.  Incomplete applications of law or justice would be impossible for such a mind.
6678/0:Tarsus has been lying to us.  But I have friends planning a rescue -- this code yellow is probably a sign they're on the move.
6679/0:If you ask me, I think they oughta make a clean sweep of the city.  Order fanatics oughta be shot on sight.
6680/0:Billie's been working for the Templars all along.  She single-handedly brought down ApostleCorp... and helped destroy her home city.
6681/0:At least it's interesting down here at this hour.  I'm sure they're all in bed in Upper Seattle. 
6682/0:I think I'm one of her favorites.
6683/0:This assignment stinks.  Since when did the SSC start hiring itself out as muscle for crooks?
6684/0:You're leaving me?!
6685/0:You're leaving me?!
6686/0:I checked out the VIP area.  No big deal.  Just a bunch of suits.
6687/0:It's not too late to avoid another Collapse.  Transmit the Aquinas specification to the WTO orbiting science platform, Ophelia.  Most of humanity wants to rebuild, Alex.  Ignore them, and what are you fighting for?  Not freedom.  Not democracy.  Then WHAT?
6688/0:Help me!
6689/0:Help me!
6690/0:That's one thing about the WTO -- justice is swift.
6691/0:Sure.
6692/0:There's another Apostlecorp lab near the Black Gate, with the usual facilities, plus one major difference -- a teleportation gate that can take you to JC Denton.  
6693/0:You will appreciate our merchandise.  You may purchase now or earn a discount by providing a service to the Omar.
6694/0:Out of my way.
6695/0:Yes -- this is the Cairo branch of your old alma-mater, curiously geared toward younger children rather than covert security.  There might be some clues about ApostleCorp inside, but the doors won't open unless you have a Visitation Pass.  Start with the Nassif greenhouse and Dr. Nassif's crooked uncle, who runs it.
6696/0:State your business.
6697/0:Poor girl.  This was her first fight.
6698/0:JC and Paul Denton never escaped their original programming.  They instead succeeded only in making copies of themselves.  Without realizing it, they work to build the precise society envisioned by the Illuminati -- and its defunct offshoot, MJ-12.  A population configured for transparency, integration, control... Follow me?
6699/0:Sure.
6700/0:Those scientists at Tarsus Academy are part of an obscure group called ApostleCorp.  They have a cell at Mako, which would concern the Templars because Mako is their main supplier of weapons.
6701/0:Ssh.  It's a secret.  We'll talk later.
6702/0:A lotta misery in this world.  Doesn't take a philosopher to see that.
6703/0:Since when does an ancient secret society set up a recruiting booth in the mall?
6704/0:It probably sounds like a lot of high-minded bullshit to an outsider.  My thoughts exactly when JC started speaking in tongues after the merger.  But the logic is compelling if you give it time.
6705/0:Ssh.  It's a secret.  We'll talk later.
6706/0:(NG Resonance song)
6707/0:(NG Resonance song)
6708/0:
6708/1:
6708/2:
6708/3:
6708/4:
6708/5:
6709/0:Too dangerous to talk!
6710/0:Too dangerous to talk!
6711/0:Girl, you're gettin' kinda clingy.
6712/0:Your fate seated among the illuminated ones beckons.
6713/0:Alex, the grays are no threat to you -- they are allied with JC.  Your focus should be gaining access to JC's sanctuary and reviving him.  You might want to talk to that gray for more details.
6714/0:When I said to get a pilot, I didn't mean steal one from the WTO!  You've put me in a bind, Alex.  It's critical that I try to recruit you to our cause, but to be honest I would like nothing more right now than for one of my troopers to put a bullet in the back of your head.
6715/0:Why don't you take care of it?
6716/0:Go ahead.  Take it.
6717/0:QueeQueg's.  A taste of class.
6718/0:Blah blah blah
6719/0:Well, I've turned your heart just in time.  Now go to the Statue and step into JC Denton's machine so that the ducts will be primed with your nanite-capsid architecture.  My scientists will do the rest.
6720/0:And your people...?
6721/0:
6721/1:
6721/2:
6721/3:
6722/0:Oops!
6722/1:Sorry!
6723/0:Oops!
6723/1:Sorry!
6724/0:Trouble in the Inclinator, but I heard they got that straightened out.
6725/0:I can take care of myself.  But why isn't SSC just getting rid of it?
6726/0:It is foolish to pass up this opportunity, but that's your choice.
6727/0:(sneeze)
6727/1:(cough)
6727/2:(giggle)
6728/0:(sneeze)
6728/1:(cough)
6728/2:(giggle)
6729/0:Plague 11 is history.  Now people are running TO the medina.
6730/0:At least we've got breathers now.  I hope they're enough to protect my children.
6731/0:Look -- a mouse!
6732/0:Look -- a mouse!
6733/0:Probably sounds paranoid... but I hope I can still have children.
6734/0:Rumor is that the craft was circling the city and not responding to WTO queries.
6735/0:You ma'am, you look like a discriminating person.  Someone who knows innovation when she sees it.
6736/0:I think you got you money's worth.  Now stab out and keep your mouth shut.
6737/0:You better not be feeding me a line.
6738/0:You said you had a map of the Templar compound.
6739/0:I don't have enough money to pay you.  [500 credits]
6740/0:Address the flaws in human nature.  Make all beings truly equal in both body and mind.  If you start with minds that are lucid, knowledgable, and emotionally sound, the needs of government change dramatically.
6741/0:What?!  Really?
6742/0:Clear the hallways!  Return to your stations!
6743/0:Risk reassessment:  minimal.
6744/0:How do you mean?
6745/0:Nice kitty.
6746/0:Nice kitty.
6747/0:I'm here to see a doctor and nobody else.  Don't bother me about my beliefs.
6748/0:Huh?
6748/1:Eh?
6748/2:Hello?
6749/0:Look!  A bird.
6750/0:The raid is going to happen any minute.
6751/0:Chill out.  We're just passin' through.
6752/0:Look!  A bird.
6753/0:Look out!  A bomb!
6754/0:Look out!  A bomb!
6755/0:I'll find a way out of this place.  Just give me time.
6756/0:Do you have time for a brief survey?
6757/0:Oh, sure.  In the evening we're usually free to move about the city.  This building is at the edge of Upper Seattle.  You'll be amazed at what a nice enclave the WTO has built.
6758/0:Have you seen anything weird?
6759/0:Well done, Alex.  Paul will join me on Liberty Island.  I have constructed a machine that will populate the atmosphere with the particles that make up our biomod architecture.  I may need your help against a force of Templars that has intervened.  More when you arrive.  Contact your pilot with the Flight Bay 23 beacon.  Don't worry about Paul -- I will arrange for his extraction.
6760/0:He was crushed, of course.  I got written up for ineffective attention to duty.
6761/0:Certainly the WTO, as well as the Order --
6762/0:I'm talkin' about PERSONAL SPACE, yo.
6763/0:I've been shot at before -- I didn't like it.
6764/0:Sounds like a good way to become a target.
6765/0:Who's the foxy lady?
6766/0:Sorry.  No exceptions.  I can't let anyone past without the security clearance.
6767/0:Yes...
6768/0:I'll be right here.
6769/0:You left Headmaster Archer alive -- an admirable show of restraint.  You should notify the SSC about him so that they can take care of the situation.  There is a security kiosk on this level outside the school.
6770/0:And the gate has only brought us destruction -- the Hateful Ones threaten, capture, and murder us.   We can neither fulfill our duties to JC, nor can we get to his habitat to awaken him.
6771/0:I'm just waiting for Mr. Dumier to give the order.
6772/0:Not really.  That so-called dating service ripped me off.
6773/0:Power itself is not evil, only the people who misuse it.
6774/0:The experiments were started by JC Denton and his brother, Paul.  They wanted to develop a biomod architecture that they could distribute to everyone on the planet.
6775/0:You will not last long without protection.
6776/0:This is a secured campus.  I wouldn't go poking my nose into people's windows.
6777/0:Well done.  Amid great evil, your heart has remained pure.
6778/0:Have you seen anything weird?
6779/0:Femi!  Come down -- it's a beautiful day for a walk.
6780/0:Yes.  Something over there.
6780/1:Yeah.  I think it was over that way.
6781/0:We want to bring humanity into the light.
6782/0:Yes.  Something over there.
6782/1:Yeah.  I think it was over that way.
6783/0:Don't worry -- your children are about to inherit your breathers.
6784/0:Nope.
6784/1:Haven't seen anything.
6785/0:Nope.
6785/1:Haven't seen anything.
6786/0:Hello!
6786/1:Hi!
6787/0:Hello!
6787/1:Hi!
6788/0:Sure.
6789/0:WTO security would like to know the same thing.  They lack evidence for a search warrant.
6790/0:I'll feel better about siding with you once you've been purified.
6791/0:Yea-ah... Green Dragon.  I put my money on sewer-gobs every time.  They're meaner.  How much you wanna bet?
6792/0:Don't be naive.  Go to the Order headquarters in the old Hartford Turbine warehouse in Lower Seattle.  It will all become clear to you.
6793/0:I always knew Archer was a jerk, but I had no idea he was psychotic too.
6794/0:There's no way to predict what will happen now.
6795/0:Curiosity compounded by recurrence.
6795/1:Hm.  Noting repetition of disturbance.
6796/0:Has High Augur Chen met your new friend?
6797/0:That sounds peculiar.
6797/1:This noise invites investigation.
6798/0:Visual data incomplete.  Possible anomaly detected.
6798/1:Suspicious partial sighting.
6799/0:Violation in progress.
6799/1:I detect a significant anomaly.
6800/0:I'll resolve this.
6800/1:Must eliminate source of disturbance.
6801/0:What?!
6801/1:Eh?!
6802/0:Wonderful.  You're lucky I haven't left yet.
6803/0:It's a deal.  Here's your money. [200]
6804/0:Possible sighting.
6804/1:Visual anomaly witnessed.
6805/0:Visual contact.
6805/1:Visible.
6806/0:I guess I made a mistake.  I thought Tarsus put out a different sort of product.  Here's your money, bandito.
6807/0:Audible.
6807/1:Sound registered.
6808/0:Felt something.
6808/1:Tactile-physical aberration.
6809/0:Already there, Chicago.
6810/0:Tomorrow night, same time, same place.  There's always new meat in the Pit.
6811/0:Hello!
6811/1:Hi!
6812/0:Yeah?  I must be dead, then.  I'm up to my eyeballs in biomods.
6813/0:Hello!
6813/1:Hi!
6814/0:You said it wasn't gonna work, too.  Then you said it was gonna get us jobs.  You've said EVERYTHING ten times over.  You call that predicting the future?
6815/0:Boo.
6815/1:Yuck.
6815/2:Go away.
6816/0:A man with black hair?  Glasses?
6817/0:Boo.
6817/1:Yuck.
6817/2:Go away.
6818/0:
6819/0:
6820/0:You hit me.
6820/1:That's not nice.
6821/0:I thought you wanted to be a corporate heavy.
6822/0:We're seeing some aberrant behaviors in the target locking mechanism in Project Serpentine.  It looks like there might be something off with the halonics.  Take a look and let me know what you find.
6823/0:Only a brave or stupid man walks here alone.
6824/0:Originally we'd planned for holding the summit here, the most secure location.  So much for that plan...
6825/0:You hit me.
6825/1:That's not nice.
6826/0:You're one of my favorite fans, Alex.  I'm ready to listen any time you have something on your mind.
6827/0:
6828/0:First install your biomods, then I'll open the door.  The upgrades will improve your survivability now that we can't protect you.
6829/0:As long as I'm on the other side of the ocean when that happens.
6830/0:Match 7!  Gobs are in the chute!  Buy-in is the house minimum.  [100 credits.]  Odds are one-to-one.
6831/0:
6832/0:(grunt) Injury.
6832/1:(grunt) 
6833/0:Silence is coming.
6834/0:Not yet.
6835/0:It's official -- no NG Resonance concert.
6836/0:WHAT?!
6836/1:Beyond parameters!
6837/0:Merely a ruse.
6837/1:Clever stratagem.
6838/0:Something has disturbed the fauna.
6838/1:Hm.  That animal seems distressed.
6839/0:That should not be open.
6839/1:Status change: should be closed.
6840/0:Status change: should be open.
6840/1:That was not closed.
6841/0:I would love to be your chamber-boy.
6842/0:
6843/0:That should not be on.
6843/1:This has been turned on.
6844/0:This has been shut off.
6844/1:That should not be off.
6845/0:Destruction.  Suspicious.
6845/1:This has been destroyed -- inquiry imminent.
6846/0:Stop doing this to me, Ani!  Oh!  (sobs)
6847/0:Should find the cause of this damage...
6847/1:Hm.  It's been damaged.
6848/0:
6849/0:At least we don't have to worry about Plague 11.  It's going to be such a relief to get outside.
6850/0:Ouch.
6850/1:Ow.
6851/0:How does a groundskeeper know about a classified prototype?
6852/0:Ouch.
6852/1:Ow.
6853/0:
6854/0:
6855/0:I don't want to play a staring game with you.
6855/1:Stop looking at me.
6856/0:I don't want to play a staring game with you.
6856/1:Stop looking at me.
6857/0:This guy, said he was a Knight Templar, he gave me some literature.  It said that the greasel tech was gonna be for humans.  Lizard soldiers who could survive gas attacks, that kinda thing.
6858/0:You're silly.
6858/1:You're acting kinda funny.
6859/0:You're silly.
6859/1:You're acting kinda funny.
6860/0:They don't pay much attentioin to you if you stay out of their way.  They were after the leadership.
6861/0:You're scaring me.
6861/1:I don't like that.
6862/0:Yeah, you're right.  This getup looks like a frogsuit.  Either I take up scuba diving, or I find an implant surgeon who can remove it.
6863/0:Let's see how many I can get with a prox mine.
6864/0:YES, we're hiring.  Mako is always looking for the best talent; etc.; etc.  They'll give you an application at the front desk.
6865/0:The Harvester will discuss.  Okay?
6866/0:I know what you mean.  I got the same routine too.
6867/0:Wait here.
6868/0:Social machinery is no less harmful to the human organism than biomodification, cybernetics, nanite plagues, and the other modern evils rightfully denounced by Luminon Saman.
6869/0:
6870/0:Hm.  Malfunction.
6870/1:There must be an error.
6871/0:I guess you're right about THAT.
6872/0:This has been disabled.
6872/1:Noting powered down status.
6873/0:That's not supposed to be here.
6873/1:That's out of place.
6874/0:It's missing...
6874/1:I don't know where it went.
6875/0:An admirable gesture regarding my brother.  I will be waiting for you in the Statue.
6876/0:Object moving...
6876/1:Movement -- that's suspicious.
6877/0:This area should be illuminated.
6877/1:It's not supposed to be dark.
6878/0:This area isn't supposed to be lighted.
6878/1:Someone turned that light on.
6879/0:Someone has opened this door.
6880/0:You may enter.
6881/0:That door was open.
6882/0:So -- which will it be?
6883/0:It appears that there has been combat.
6883/1:Hm.  Evidence of a conflict.
6884/0:No....!  NO!  The Templars are damaging the Helios core!  Satisfied, Alex?  I'm mortal like you again.  Helios won't be able to save me this time, but I don't plan to be the one who needs saving.
6885/0:
6886/0:
6887/0:You're scaring me.
6887/1:I don't like that.
6888/0:That's what happens when people can't find work.  They have too much time to sit around and start believing who-KNOWS-what.
6889/0:This has been today's 'WTO Did You Know?'  Check back tomorrow for more fascinating facts.
6890/0:Very interesting.
6890/1:Hmmm, what could it mean?
6890/2:... could imply a threat...
6891/0:I don't think you're supposed to be here.
6891/1:You're going to get in trouble for being here.
6892/0:Bizarre.
6892/1:It can't be...
6893/0:I don't think you're supposed to be here.
6893/1:You're going to get in trouble for being here.
6894/0:So you really are serious about this -- leaving all your work at Tarsus behind so you can join this church.  How do you know we can trust THEM?  They attacked the apartments and put us in danger.
6895/0:We are working to protect the Earth.  We have no interest in materials or money.
6896/0:A glimpse of something.  But what?
6896/1:Hm, should I trust my eyes...?
6897/0:Sorry, plum cake.  I can't do much until I get my wings back.
6898/0:Ah... Right in front of me...
6898/1:You dare come before me?
6899/0:'Nuff!
6899/1:Stop it!
6900/0:This is what we've been reduced to?!
6901/0:'Nuff!
6901/1:Stop it!
6902/0:Get away from me.
6902/1:I'm going to tell.
6903/0:Get away from me.
6903/1:I'm going to tell.
6904/0:(sigh) Too many trials...
6905/0:That's quite a claim.
6906/0:Guess I haven't scored any points with Dr. Nassif.
6907/0:Hello there, I've got an appointment...
6908/0:I've seen others fall for his pretty deceptions.  They ended up doing unspeakably ugly things. 
6909/0:Maybe later.
6910/0:A lot of people say they're seekers, but they just go along with the Order Church because it's so in-your-face all the time.
6911/0:Fire -- rarely a good sign.
6912/0:Yes... this way... come...
6913/0:This smoke...
6914/0:Blood -- that's noteworthy.
6914/1:Evidence: blood -- registered.
6915/0:There is something about that shadow...
6915/1:Hm.  In the shadows...
6916/0:...and the beast lost the battle, apparently.
6916/1:Hm.  Carcass.
6917/0:I'm not kidding about an attack.  I saw a guard die in an explosion.
6918/0:A body.
6918/1:Casualty report.
6919/0:Inert organic.
6919/1:Unconscious body.
6920/0:A corpse.
6920/1:Another dead body.
6921/0:Sounds...
6921/1:Yes, I'm hearing something...
6922/0:Yes, I felt something...
6923/0:(grunt) An attack...
6923/1:(grunt) An enemy... but where?
6924/0:A shadow...
6925/0:The other key is already here.  It is time to awaken JC, but we fear she is here to prevent it and to harm him.  You must stop her and you must revive him.
6926/0:Can't fool me...
6927/0:Hm, signs of fighting...
6928/0:Mmmmm....
6928/1:Strange...
6929/0:Possibly a disturbance, yes...
6929/1:What could it be?
6930/0:Another sign of peril...
6930/1:Mmmm, yes... Surely I can't be mistaken this time.
6931/0:Military power will never vanish.  What we hope -- and Her Holiness once agreed with me -- is that a global police force would end territorial wars and be just that -- police, like the seekers in the medina.
6932/0:Order be praised -- you have a strong will after all.  Those crooks have been trying to run us out of town.  Now take care of Sak so that she can't hire replacements.
6933/0:The Regional Director has been disappointed in my profits since the intensification of Nanite Swell 11.  I lose the shop if I can't find a way to impress him.
6934/0:...making tomorrow look like yesterday...
6935/0:I was mistaken.
6935/1:Perhaps it was nothing.
6936/0:Her Holiness can burn in Hell.  Human Purity used to be her motto.  Now she waters it down for enclave types who don't belong in the Church to begin with.
6937/0:Maybe the Order will finally stay out of our way.
6938/0:
6939/0:You better talk to someone.  Exoskeletal armor can break bones if it doesn't fit right.
6940/0:A BONUS?  You expect me to walk into a chemical spill for a few extra credits?
6941/0:The Templars have been airlifting troops into the arcology.  This is a foreign invasion, pure and simple.
6942/0:Know anything about the WTO guards at the bar?
6943/0:
6944/0:
6945/0:I killed the security chief, just as you asked.
6946/0:Politicians existed only because determining the will of the people was a tedious and time-consuming process.  One vote every couple of years was the most input any government asked of its people.
6947/0:Engaging in combat.
6947/1:You will regret this.
6948/0:Re-engaging enemy.
6948/1:I will finish you this time.
6949/0:I'm sorry, the Inclinator is closed until we can get this toxic spill cleaned up.
6950/0:Draw your weapon, though it won't help you much.
6950/1:My advantage.
6951/0:Another obstacle in your Search, young Seeker -- as the director told you, the inclinator, which is the only way to reach Lower Seattle and our church, has been shut down because of a toxic spill.  No one there seems equal to the task, but I'm sure you can find a way to continue on this path toward Order.
6952/0:Targetting enemy...
6952/1:Almost... in my sights...
6953/0:I'm sending in a bot.
6953/1:It looks like time for some mech support.
6954/0:The Order is an intolerant cult.  They hate multinational corporations and the private security forces that protect them.
6955/0:I hope you find what you are seeking.
6956/0:I'm summoning a bot.
6956/1:I'll call for a bot.
6957/0:Call for military mech support.
6957/1:Military bot needed.
6958/0:Calling for med bot.
6958/1:Med bot assistance required.
6959/0:Good choice, friend.
6960/0:Well, the coward will be coming back -- I'm certain of that.
6960/1:Nothing.  How could I have lost the trail...?
6961/0:Much anger in this one...  I have a feeling this isn't over.
6962/0:The murderer is dissatisfied...  I must prepare for an additional catastrophe.
6963/0:Alliance:  Illuminati.  We are pleased you have chosen the Light.
6964/0:Thievery is not the intruder's interest.  An assault is coming -- and soon.
6965/0:I have a black-market biomod canister, which enables non-Piezochem functionality.  I am also selling three energy cells for powering your biomodified systems.  Or you might want two EMP grenades, for disrupting electronic devices, such as surveillance equipment.  As a preferred customer, you may purchase items at half-market price.
6966/0:No new news on the fifteen global Nanite Swells.  Except for a significant shift in Swell 9 five years ago due to some el nino activity, no change or disintegration has ever been observed in them.  
6967/0:That was Alex...
6968/0:You some sort of WTO special agent?
6969/0:Gone.  I wish I could read his heart...
6970/0:Gone.  I wish I could read her heart...
6971/0:You'd better go.  Chairman Dumier will wonder what we've been talking about for so long.
6972/0:I should investigate...
6972/1:Yes, I will see about this...
6972/2:What could it be?
6973/0:A whole gang snuck into Upper Seattle today -- and I'm not talking about seekers.
6974/0:Something -- yes, something...
6974/1:I'm not usually mistaken...
6974/2:So hazardous here...
6975/0:You!
6975/1:Danger!
6975/2:No!
6976/0:Quit hangin' around.  Someone's gonna see us.
6977/0:This is a bad time to be harassing strangers.  We just had a terrorist attack, you know.
6978/0:This is not the solution I was looking for.  
6979/0:Oh...  Yeah...  Somehow my daughter, Sandy, got away from me.  She's probably just looking at another one of the exhibits... a naturally scientific and curious mind -- I think she may make it into Tarsus next year...  Anyway, as I was saying, it's probably nothing but I am a bit worried.  
6980/0:Read the pit, now.  Use your head!
6981/0:Yes.  Missionaries.
6982/0:Calling for repair bot.
6982/1:Repair bot assistance required.
6983/0:I apologize.
6983/1:Error.
6984/0:Opponent hiding.
6984/1:Target obscured.
6985/0:Coward.
6985/1:Enemy taking flight.
6986/0:Poor aim.  
6986/1:You won't last long.
6987/0:We don't have time for niceties.  Dr. Todd is waiting for you in the flight bay.  Do as he asks.  As long as you cooperate, my paladins will hold their fire.  I will have additional instructions for you when you reach Liberty Island.
6988/0:The target has biomods.
6988/1:Engaging modified enemy.
6989/0:(grunt) You'll have to try harder than that.
6989/1:(grunt) That was adequate.
6990/0:(grunt) You've got my attention now.
6990/1:(grunt) I'm going to remember this.
6991/0:(grunt) Self-destruct implant charging...
6991/1:(grunt) Grim injuries.
6992/0:(grunt) Poison detected.
6992/1:(grunt) Toxin suspected....  mmmph.
6993/0:You will die...
6993/1:Face me.
6993/2:How is this happening?
6994/0:What?!
6994/1:(gasp)
6995/0:So be it.
6995/1:This will be a simple matter.
6996/0:Don't interfere.
6996/1:Yes, in an instant your fate will be decided.
6997/0:I overheard the assassins talking.  Yes -- they plan to kill your entire family.  You better stay put until they're gone.
6998/0:I don't know where she is, but she better show up soon.  The facility here is being raided by the Templars.  So far we're holding our own, but I don't know how much longer that will last.  This may be my last transmission...
6999/0:
6999/1:
7000/0:You won't escape again...
7000/1:This one is deranged...
7000/2:Your time has run out!
7001/0:Let me think about it.
7002/0:Defend yourself if you can.
7003/0:In range, yes...
7003/1:A clear shot...
7004/0:Sure, you expect this sort of thing in Cleveland, but not in Seattle.
7005/0:
7006/0:The biotech team will be meeting in one hour.  Remember to bring your rebreathers.
7007/0:I will find you.
7007/1:Very close -- yes, I'm certain.
7008/0:I guess they figured nobody would go looking for laboratories under an old Roman fortification.
7009/0:Saw monsters dropping out of the attic in that alcove!
7010/0:The battle turns...
7010/1:Change your mind?
7011/0:Well, yes -- in a manner of speaking.  MJ-12 was a splinter of the Illuminati, so anything that hurt them benefitted the remaining families.  But I wasn't an Illuminatus at the time.
7012/0:We are about to show this guy what happens when you push Panzerwerks too far....  Keep walking.
7013/0:(cough cough)  It's okay, Mom.  I'll get better.
7014/0:Go down to the landing pad.  I'll send word to Sid to meet you at the jet.
7015/0:Alex D.  The information you provided our agent was incorrect.  The Omar trader in the medina has been assassinated.  Your future business with the Omar will proceed on much less favorable terms.
7016/0:(grunt) It appears that I am on fire.
7016/1:(grunt) Hm.  I am...flammable.
7017/0:(grunt) Visuals disrupted.
7017/1:(grunt) I cannot see.
7018/0:I'm staying here until I'm sure I can make it to the medina without getting shot.
7019/0:
7020/0:Nothing suffered.
7020/1:Ineffectual blow.
7021/0:Lookin' for a sure thing?  She's right under the grate there.  Check out the scales on that girl!  That's Green Dragon, a new gob fresh from the sewer.  Mean as nails.
7022/0:
7023/0:Explosive has been deployed.
7023/1:Look out -- grenade thrown.
7024/0:Threat detected -- grenade.
7024/1:Grenade sighted.
7025/0:Well, apparently they can get you inside an arcology facility where there's proof.  Personally, I'm not going to waste my time saving the planet until we figure out where Dr. Nassif is hiding.
7026/0:(grunt)
7026/1:(grunt)
7027/0:I've failed...
7027/1:Oh... the end...
7027/2:It's all winding down...
7028/0:(grunt)
7028/1:Mmmmph.
7029/0:(gasp)
7030/0:I just work the booth.
7031/0:Connection.
7031/1:Attack successful.
7032/0:Forgotten how to use a weapon?
7032/1:Close...  // relief
7033/0:Isn't it awful?  Can you believe the Mechanics Union -- or whoever it was -- thinks they can kill a world leader and get away with it?
7034/0:Your biomods are nothing compared to mine!
7034/1:Yes, use your powers.  You will need them...
7035/0:I've got to prepare for NG's arrival.
7036/0:(grunt)
7036/1:(grunt)
7037/0:(groan)
7037/1:(groan) It can't be...
7038/0:(moan)
7038/1:(moan) Helios!  Can you hear me...?
7039/0:Thanks, miss.
7040/0:(groan) Fool!  You cut your own throat...
7041/0:
7042/0:I hope they re-open the school.  Mom says it is my insurance against being poor.
7043/0:(gasp) (cough)
7043/1:(gasp) (cough)
7044/0:(scream)
7044/1:(scream)
7045/0:(groan) My eyes!
7046/0:Yes... an unmarked suite, southeast corner of the arcology.  I think there is an ATM out front.
7047/0:(groan)
7048/0:This town'll be talkin' about Gob-zilla for decades.  She's set every record in the book.
7049/0:If I had the money, I'd pay your WTO dues in exchange for that key.  [300 credits]
7050/0:Use the keypad.  I'm just here to deal with the troublemakers.
7051/0:I think these Templars are itchin' for a war.
7052/0:This is some coincidence.  Either there's a contract on my head --
7053/0:I might have given you a key to the gate in the courtyard, but if you'd rather fight your way through a greasel nest, I guess I can't stop you.
7054/0:Yes, my Seeker.  Her Holiness is with us.
7055/0:No thanks.  I've seen all I need to see.
7056/0:There have been no indications yet what their next move may be.  Experts anticipate drastic measures, based on what we've learned so far.
7057/0:What were you doing in there?
7058/0:Talk about the VIP club to no one, and we will always be here for your convenience.
7059/0:Shot successful.
7059/1:Just got to keep you in my sights.
7060/0:Miss.
7060/1:I can't connect.
7060/2:Adjusting aim...
7061/0:I'm surprised you were such an easy kill.
7061/1:I wonder why you didn't put up a fight.
7062/0:Even though Archer was stopped, they have managed to take over most of Cairo and now we're trapped here.
7063/0:This is too easy.
7063/1:(sigh)  I'm not even trying.
7064/0:You better not rip me off.
7065/0:You're a fool for engaging me.
7065/1:You are doomed.
7065/2:Not very good at this, are you?
7066/0:Target will be neutralized soon.
7066/1:You have but little time left.
7067/0:This battle will soon end, in my favor.
7067/1:Triumph is near.
7068/0:You failed us at the critical time, Alex.  All our efforts to explain our doctrines to you have been wasted.  Do you understand the consequences of your actions?  The Church can be slow to act, but, trust me -- you don't want Her Holiness as an enemy.
7069/0:Do you know anything about Flight Bay 24?
7070/0:You are an intriguing challenge.
7070/1:Curious.  This is an even match.
7071/0:This is going poorly.
7071/1:Hope deserts me.
7072/0:'Evening.
7073/0:
7074/0:(groan)
7075/0:Uh!
7076/0:Here's the data I uncovered.  Looks like the owner has some undeclared sources of income.
7077/0:I was just trying to make it safe to work at Panzerwerks again.
7078/0:(gasp)
7079/0:
7079/1:
7080/0:A futile attempt...
7080/1:You can't hurt ME!
7081/0:Got it.
7082/0:Yes.
7082/1:Good, good...
7083/0:NOW what do you say...?
7083/1:We all choose our fate.
7083/2:A pity I have to destroy you.
7084/0:Notice that I have excellent marksmanship.
7084/1:Ah, good shot.  Want another?  // self-congratulatory
7085/0:I wouldn't ask too many questions if I was you.
7086/0:Get away from me!
7086/1:(growl)
7087/0:There were an awful lot of strange files in Nassif's office -- All this stuff about test subjects and observation -- I can't imagine what that has to do with Tarsus.  You should see if you have more luck poking around.
7088/0:I suppose you're entitled to your opinion.
7089/0:Justice is done.
7089/1:Now for more important matters...
7090/0:Still so far away from the ideal after all these years.
7090/1:A terrible loss.  What can I do to convince them?
7091/0:You don't wear it.  It replaces your frontal lobes.
7092/0:The hazardous materials are yet to be contained, yet an unidentified woman did reactivate the Inclinator and travel through the spill. Her motives remain unknown.
7093/0:Order will prevail.  It always does, whether the cause is mystical or merely secular.
7094/0:How precious.  Why couldn't you waltz into my life sooner?
7095/0:Me?  I just want Creation back.  God's Creation.  The birds, the squirrels... Not some Order hokum about mental states.  Not Feudal Knights slaying lizards in the sewers.  I want the EARTH back.
7096/0:Never cower from the Truth.
7097/0:I found Her Holiness.  Turns out she's Nicolette DuClare -- an Illuminatus.
7098/0:Well, they will.  The whole point of an enclave is to be self-sufficient.  Once they're established, they'll crash a helicopter into the Inclinator and blame it on a drunk smuggler.
7099/0:Uh... I didn't.  You destroyed their coffee?
7100/0:(grunt)
7100/1:(grunt)
7101/0:The entrance to the mosque is on this level.  You'll notice that the village has been decimated by a disease called Plague 11 thanks to WTO indifference to nanite pollution.  Dr. Nassif comes from a poor family in the area.  If you and Billie help the locals, maybe they will put you on her trail.
7102/0:He was gonna take me with him this time...
7103/0:Assistance required!
7103/1:Backup requested!
7104/0:Certainly.
7104/1:Immediately.
7104/2:Yes.  I'm on the way.
7105/0:My character is not called Dumier, but, well, yes -- he was a freedom fighter in Europe before the Collapse.  He had great ideals and now finds himself beholden to crude realities.
7106/0:Illumination imminent.
7106/1:Glory.  Secret.
7106/2:They'll never know...
7106/3:...working for the true masters...
7107/0:
7108/0:(growl)
7108/1:(grumble)
7108/2:(mutter)
7108/3:(hums)
7109/0:(gasp)
7110/0:Poor choice.
7110/1:Cease and desist.
7111/0:I am not permitted to discuss my research.
7112/0:(gasp)
7113/0:You've misjudged your path.  Please correct.
7113/1:Do not touch me.
7114/0:Hold still!
7114/1:I can't hit!
7115/0:Cease staring at me.
7115/1:I take mild offense at your glare. 
7116/0:Hold still!
7116/1:I can't hit!
7117/0:You actions make little sense.
7117/1:Peculiar behavior.  Please depart.
7118/0:I can't connect!
7118/1:I'm just getting warmed up.
7119/0:I can't connect!
7119/1:I'm just getting warmed up.
7120/0:(growl)  // frustrated
7120/1:Slipped through my fingers...
7120/2:Impossible!  I'm not connecting...
7121/0:Argh!  My aim is awful!
7121/1:That was a warning shot.
7122/0:An easy matter.
7122/1:I can't stand these petty annoyances.
7123/0:You think you know something.  Fine.  But if you had any idea who I really work for, you wouldn't touch a hair on my head.
7124/0:Argh!  My aim is awful!
7124/1:That was a warning shot.
7125/0:You dare oppose me?
7125/1:You chose poorly, Alex.
7125/2:Look at me!  You don't stand a chance...
7125/3:If you kill me, you only delay the inevitable.
7125/4:Death is meaningless to me... including yours.
7126/0:(grunt)
7126/1:(grunt)
7126/2:(grunt)
7127/0:This won't take long...
7127/1:It always pains me to watch a life come to its end.
7128/0:So this is how it ends?  Okay.  I'm ready, but I don't think you are.  You may have dealt with SSC or even armored Templars before, but you've never taken on a true equal -- or a friend.  But I guess you're just as crazy as the rest of them, another threat to be neutralized.  It's over, Alex.
7129/0:But don't the locals depend on the factory for jobs?
7130/0:(grunt)
7130/1:(grunt)
7130/2:(grunt)
7131/0:Not just the sound barrier.  He can see us.
7132/0:Your power is nothing compared to mine.
7132/1:Any regrets, brave specimen?
7133/0:Just a temporary annoyance...
7133/1:A pity I must destroy so many things in order to create something new.
7134/0:This is the main control room where you will install the Sequencing Module once the power is restored.
7135/0:I could use your help with the Illuminati commandos guarding the south dock.
7136/0:This may be the first serious challenge I will have to face.
7136/1:Not another delay... I don't have time for this!
7137/0:I can't fail NOW.  No...
7137/1:This can't end in a mindless brawl.
7138/0:(grunt)
7138/1:(grunt)
7138/2:(grunt)
7139/0:Yes, yes...
7139/1:What is it, Helios...?
7139/2:Hear me, Helios...
7139/3:So many contingencies...
7139/4:Inevitable -- yes, it's inevitable...
7139/5:... abstraction of mind and matter, yes...
7139/6:More data, I need more...
7140/0:I'm tired of standing around.  Let's do this.
7141/0:I'll take the black market biomod. [500]
7142/0:They say you can't beat a nanotech virus.  Supposedly, it'll evolve a resistant strain, then the cloud will come back.
7143/0:Any tips?  You must know the floorplan by heart.
7144/0:We're just here to make sure the crowd doesn't get too rowdy.
7145/0:What are you doing down here?
7146/0:What were you doing in there?
7147/0:This area is restricted.  Please vacate.
7147/1:You are not permitted access here.
7148/0:Very funny.
7148/1:You must not realize the foolishness of your gesture.
7149/0:Physical affront noted.  Depart.  
7149/1:You would do well to leave before I reconsider your offense.
7150/0:Your judgment appears impaired.
7150/1:You continue to ignore my directives.  There will be consequences.
7151/0:(laughing) Yeah... get a good look at those creatures yet?  Jesus.  Born in a lab and then living out here like savages, JC Denton the only human being within a thousand miles.  I wonder if he really merged his brain with an AI.
7152/0:You infringe on me physically once more.  
7152/1:You will incite my wrath with this jostling.
7153/0:You should not continue to stare.
7153/1:Your gaze has been noted.  
7154/0:Come out, you coward.
7154/1:Enough of this hiding.
7155/0:Your nonsense with me can lead to no good.
7155/1:My patience with this bizarre behavior can only stretch so far.
7156/0:I wish I had enough credits for the multitools. [200]
7157/0:Come out, you coward.
7157/1:Enough of this hiding.
7158/0:I cannot be clearer:  You are not permitted here.
7158/1:I will remove you myself if I must.
7159/0:Coward!
7159/1:Good thing you bailed.
7160/0:I assure you - you are not prepared for my answer to this threat.
7160/1:Depart with your foolish threats, or suffer greatly.
7161/0:You said you had a map of the Templar compound.
7162/0:Coward!
7162/1:Good thing you bailed.
7163/0:Additional damages noted.  Continuing these actions is dangerous.
7163/1:Your imposition is minor, but my retaliation will be great...
7164/0:You're quite the diplomat.
7165/0:Ha!  You missed!
7165/1:Pretty poor aim there, sport.
7166/0:
7167/0:Ha!  You missed!
7167/1:Pretty poor aim there, sport.
7168/0:I hope none of my deliveries are delayed.
7169/0:I have to live under curfew because a bunch of treehuggers will not leave the bot factory alone.
7170/0:Okay, maybe I can do this...
7171/0:
7172/0:Okay, maybe I can do this...
7173/0:We'll make it.
7174/0:We'll make it.
7175/0:YES, we're hiring.  Mako is always looking for the best talent; etc.; etc.  They'll give you an application at the front desk.
7176/0:Still unresolved.  Our people have the area closed to pedestrians.
7177/0:Get out!
7178/0:Panzerwerks finally reached their breaking point.
7179/0:I don't take it back, if that's what you mean.
7180/0:How do I know you won't change your tune once you have the technology?
7181/0:And the plague lasted for years.
7182/0:
7183/0:Shall we conduct business, or shall we wait until you examine the mutant?
7184/0:
7185/0:Tell you what.  I'll give you Mr. Levine's usual hitman bounty plus fifty percent to go back to that facade of a nightclub and murder the VIP he's so keen on protecting.  [450 credits]
7186/0:The WTO promised peace through trade, of course.  I should've known when the first thing the nanoformers put up was a wall.
7187/0:JC Denton has a hold on your imagination, perhaps.  Talk to your friend Leo in front of the mosque.  See how much he likes enforced modification.  Do you really think ApostleCorp is any different than the sect of the Omar?
7188/0:We were out shopping and needed a break.  There weren't a lot of options.
7189/0:You may pass.
7190/0:This is too close.  Gotta tip the scales.
7191/0:This is too close.  Gotta tip the scales.
7192/0:(laugh)  About three hours behind, if my clock is right.  I now know where the teleporter takes its passengers.  My people are closing in on JC's sanctuary this very second.
7193/0:I think we can still pull this off.
7194/0:I think we can still pull this off.
7195/0:Oh God!  It's a lost cause...
7196/0:Oh God!  It's a lost cause...
7197/0:No wonder they fix prices at headquarters.  They have a worldwide monopoly.
7198/0:Why us?!  How did this happen?!
7199/0:I don't know why the plumbing for the arcology is so important, but this IS a restricted area.
7200/0:Why us?!  How did this happen?!
7201/0:Kirkpatrick?  I've never --
7202/0:I'm going to take care of this, once and for all.
7202/1:You're gonna be sorry you messed with me.
7203/0:I'm going to take care of this, once and for all.
7203/1:You're gonna be sorry you messed with me.
7204/0:I can't believe my mother agreed to that...
7205/0:
7206/0:Open your eyes!  The Order is a designer religion, calculated to attract the largest number of believers.
7207/0:That is how I think Chairman Dumier must feel.  He could deregulate nanotech construction, and Symmetriad Corporation could fill the planet with New Cairo pyramids in about three years.
7208/0:
7209/0:You will appreciate our merchandise.  You may purchase now at market value, or redress an earlier affront to the Omar by performing a service for us.  This would earn you a discount.
7210/0:
7211/0:I can't take on any more gear right now.  Hold on.
7212/0:Knowing my luck, the Templars will attack five minutes before the evacuation.
7213/0:What's your rate?
7214/0:The leader of the Cairo facility... captured by the Templars.
7215/0:Good work.  Power is restored and the beacon is ready to be activated.  Just turn it on and your pilot will be able to land.
7216/0:
7217/0:You had your chance.
7217/1:I tried to let you escape.
7218/0:You had your chance.
7218/1:I tried to let you escape.
7219/0:You sure made a mistake, starting something with me.
7219/1:I mean to finish this.
7220/0:You sure made a mistake, starting something with me.
7220/1:I mean to finish this.
7221/0:You're not gonna get away.
7221/1:Starting this was your last mistake.
7222/0:I can't stand those transgenics.  I can make it worth your while if you take care of it for me.
7223/0:You're not gonna get away.
7223/1:Starting this was your last mistake.
7224/0:You're nothing we can't handle.
7224/1:We'll mop up the floor with you.
7225/0:You're nothing we can't handle.
7225/1:We'll mop up the floor with you.
7226/0:How do you like that?
7226/1:See?  I can take care of myself.
7227/0:How do you like that?
7227/1:See?  I can take care of myself.
7228/0:The only safe way to deal with such dangerous power in such an unstable individual is to destroy him.  It's the only way.
7229/0:This is a Code Yellow health advisory.
7230/0:I'm looking for somebody.  That's all you need to know.
7231/0:Yeah, good for me and good for you, too -- if you come around ready to bet next time I get a shot at the title.
7232/0:WTO Chairman Dumier is irredeemable.  He has led too many down the path of greed and disorder.
7233/0:Chairman Dumier, the leader of your opposition, has taken a special interest in your safety.
7234/0:Sorry, I don't have that kind of money.
7235/0:Piece of cake.
7236/0:I'll give up my life before I let someone paw through our data.
7237/0:I hope I'm not too late!
7238/0:Perhaps this is the end of our troubles.
7239/0:Thanks.  That's very thoughtful.
7240/0:Market disruption. The genius of the ApostleCorp product is that it restructures any host's DNA to tolerate biomodification, whereas the standard infusions work for only one in twenty patients.  ApostleCorp could go commercial and devastate biomod prices.
7241/0:Afraid I'm trolling for bigger fish, Buck.
7242/0:I don't think so.
7243/0:The Omar.  Hmph.  They show up out of nowhere.  Now they are in a hurry to turn into something even stranger.
7244/0:Earlier today, WTO Director Chad Dumier proposed a summit meeting between his organization and Order officials in response to the rioting in Trier, Germany.
7245/0:I am preparing to meet you in Flight Bay 23, but the pilot beacon seems to be offline.  You will need to activate it before I can land.
7246/0:Yeah, good for me and good for you, too -- if you've got any money to bet.
7247/0:I'm starting to enjoy myself.
7248/0:This gig is working out.
7249/0:You know the deal.  For a reasonable sum of money, it's just like you have the pass.
7250/0:He's toast.
7250/1:Got him!
7251/0:He's toast.
7251/1:Got him!
7252/0:She's toast.
7252/1:Got her!
7253/0:She's toast.
7253/1:Got her!
7254/0:Anything I want.  Anything.  The best mods are black-market.  Attack drones.  Bot domination.  This will add value when I go back to the corporate market.
7255/0:My God...
7255/1:You're not that great after all, eh?
7255/2:Why did you drive me to this?!
7256/0:My God...
7256/1:You're not that great after all, eh?
7256/2:Why did you drive me to this?!
7257/0:You never see the seekers getting sick, do you?  I wonder if they invented the plague to drive people to desperation.
7258/0:They can be defeated.  We just have to have faith, Alex.
7259/0:Go away.  Take the intruders with you.
7260/0:Whatever your security concerns, you can make it with Mako.
7261/0:"Meet other outgoing, particulate-infected singles."  (bitter laugh)
7262/0:We share your condemnation of the WTO, and we appreciate your dedication to nonviolent solutions when possible.
7263/0:Make your decision.
7264/0:I'll stay airborne until you're ready to be picked up.
7265/0:I'm the one who has to face the music, especially given the Chicago situation...
7266/0:
7267/0:We were having a discussion.  Leave us be.
7268/0:I guess so.
7269/0:All clear.
7269/1:No problem here.
7270/0:Sir?
7271/0:Ma'am?
7272/0:It is not yet clear whether the substances being transported were mislabeled, prohibited, or simply mishandled by the Inclinator crew.
7273/0:You KNOW?  But -- he told me not to tell you.  What's going on?
7274/0:She's all yours.
7275/0:Somebody help me!
7276/0:Somebody help me!
7277/0:Here I come.
7277/1:I'm on it.
7278/0:Here I come.
7278/1:I'm on it.
7279/0:Then your ear bends to the Worldly-Wiseman, to continue the archaic analogy.  The smallest breeze carries you off Nature's straight and narrow path, which is ever eroded by the human lust for transcendence.
7280/0:It sounds like the missionaries to the enclaves will get to live there.  My family would like that.
7281/0:JC sleeps.  Unsafe.
7282/0:Sure you don't want me to mark the guards on your map?
7283/0:I'm sure you'll put your purchase to good use.  heh heh
7284/0:Oh yeah, you ugly witch?  Do it!
7285/0:Oh yeah, you ugly witch?  Do it!
7286/0:Enough!
7286/1:You are required by law to comply with my orders.
7287/0:
7288/0:Enough!
7288/1:You are required by law to comply with my orders.
7289/0:I've got a Fragmentary Round weapon mod -- snap this on and your shot will explode on impact.  I've also got two ammo clips -- always useful.  Finally I've got three EMP grenades to use on those pesky bots and such.
7290/0:Awaiting funds transfer...
7291/0:Nevermind... I'll tell you later when it's safe.
7292/0:Jerk.
7293/0:Nevermind... I'll tell you later when it's safe.
7294/0:Jerk.
7295/0:I'm kinda hungry.
7295/1:I need to get more sleep.
7295/2:Like I never heard THAT ONE before...
7295/3:Always tellin' me to iron my shirt...
7295/4:Should've washed my hands.
7295/5:Wish doctors weren't so damn expensive.
7295/6:That's the LAST TIME they pass ME over for a raise.
7295/7:Always havin' to pack my lunch.
7295/8:Should never have dropped out of the SSC.
7295/9:Wish everyone would just get off my back.
7295/10:I'll just get a new one... someday.
7295/11:My kids must think I'm a big joke.
7296/0:Crazy chick.
7297/0:Your actions in Antarctica prove you're honorable and you keep your word.  I've realized that we've known each other too long to let others order us to assassinate each other.  I'm supposed to keep this area secure, and I intend to take down anyone else who comes by, but you're free to go, Alex.
7298/0:I'm kinda hungry.
7298/1:I need to get more sleep.
7299/0:Crazy chick.
7300/0:According to my map, there should be an airport 22 kilometers northeast of central Cairo.  Instead, that seems to be the site of a landfill.
7301/0:Not now!
7301/1:Too dangerous!
7302/0:I am authorized to use force.
7302/1:You don't want to see me when I get mad.
7302/2:You better back down.
7303/0:At last -- the moment is at hand.  Step into the device and let us exorcise that second soul of nanites.  You shall be reborn -- and so shall humanity.
7304/0:Not now!
7305/0:I am authorized to use force.
7305/1:You don't want to see me when I get mad.
7305/2:You better back down.
7306/0:This better be good.
7307/0:Sorry!
7307/1:I didn't mean to do that!
7308/0:(yawn)
7308/1:(cough)
7308/2:(ahem)
7308/3:(sneeze)
7309/0:You shoulda seen the first match.  There was blood and acid slime hangin' from the rafters...
7310/0:I looked around the school.  Your daughter had a close call, but she's fine.  The new headmaster is working for the Templars -- some sort of plot to murder the most talented students and their families.
7311/0:Are the paladins ready?
7312/0:
7313/0:We're here to make sure you keep your mouth shut about Lt. Archer's project.
7314/0:I just hope Jamila and Jennifer are safe.
7315/0:I've already tracked Dr. Nassif to Cairo.
7316/0:Nothing in Lower Seattle worth the trip, if you ask me.
7317/0:Poor girl.  This was her first fight.
7318/0:You were a little out of line there.
7318/1:I want you to take it easy.
7319/0:You were a little out of line there.
7319/1:I want you to take it easy.
7320/0:Just hold on!
7320/1:Sorry -- we have a situation here.
7321/0:Just hold on!
7321/1:Sorry -- we have a situation here.
7322/0:Damn rats...
7323/0:I can't open it!
7324/0:Damn rats...
7325/0:I can't open it!
7326/0:We have intel that a terrorist group may be planning a major attack on this facility, so we're relocating two trainees to Seattle.  Please make the necessary preparations. I'll be sending along their dossiers soon.
7327/0:Vegetation losses have exceeded acceptable ranges.
7328/0:Here, kitty, kitty...
7329/0:Oh great, I'm penned in.
7330/0:Here, kitty, kitty...
7331/0:Oh great, I'm penned in.
7332/0:Well, you're the one who wanted to be such a badass.
7333/0:I grew up in the enclave -- I guess I'm just terrified of unprotected neighborhoods.
7334/0:No loitering.  Move along now.
7335/0:Queequeg's coffeehops.  Bright, clean... your sanctuary from life's worries.  
7336/0:Flying rats.
7337/0:(grunt)
7337/1:(grunt) Comin' through...
7338/0:Damn it, Alex -- the WTO needs her alive for questioning!
7339/0:Flying rats.
7340/0:(grunt)
7340/1:(grunt) Comin' through...
7341/0:Never mess around with the boss's son, or else you end up with an assignment like this.
7342/0:Stay true, young Pliable.  Now go to the Statue and step into JC Denton's machine so that the ducts will be primed with your nanite-capsid architecture.  My scientists will do the rest.
7343/0:Silly birds.
7344/0:An excellent choice.
7345/0:Silly birds.
7346/0:They may never know how we have shaped the world for them.
7347/0:Fire in the hole!
7348/0:Fire in the hole!
7349/0:You mean the guys with the bug eyes and gray skin? Ugh.
7350/0:I will be waiting for you here at Liberty Island.  JC Denton seems to be constructing some sort of Statue -- a tribute to Machinery, it appears.  We choose Liberty, Alex, which is the preservation of humanity not just from legal machinery but from all forms of machinery.
7351/0:Of course.  Alex.  Sorry, they say the brain-freeze snaps off a few dendrites.  So, it's time.  Your biomod architecture -- it's universal?  That's what reversed my coma?
7352/0:Full payment is necessary before the exchange.
7353/0:Glad the director found someone to clean up the spill.
7354/0:Yeah.  Anything I should know?
7355/0:
7356/0:I always wonder, though, when did the arcology leadership know?  Did they tell us right away?
7357/0:Heck yeah.  I've got the keys and codes for every door in this place.  They all dismiss me as Lower Seattle trash, but I see more than they would like.  Someday it's going to pay off.
7358/0:That and much more.  We're now ready to transform the human race.  It became clear to me after the defeat of MJ-12 that the old answers to tyranny are inadequate.  I needed the Helios merger in order to contemplate the problem effectively.
7359/0:The epicenter of the Chicago event was on the street in front of our building.  We were the target.  I'm sure of that.
7360/0:Too late.  The WTO already has the schematic.  You should have acted more quickly.
7361/0:Everything satisfactory, miss?  I am the owner.
7362/0:The Director has got to be having a fit right now.
7363/0:
7364/0:Unless somebody tells them.
7365/0:Which side?  Order or WTO?
7366/0:Just get me to the Rauchstadt.  And try not to draw too much attention .
7367/0:Whoa!  Not safe.   // stopping suddenly near radiation
7367/1:Too risky.  Better keep clear of it.
7368/0:Whoa!  Not safe.   // stopping suddenly near radiation
7368/1:Too risky.  Better keep clear of it.
7369/0:Eyes forward, pal.
7370/0:Eyes forward, hun.
7371/0:I follow you so far.
7372/0:Look out!  Stingball!
7373/0:I'll go find another unit.
7373/1:We need more officers.
7374/0:That's the word from command.  Alex is their little brother, I guess.  Just as dangerous, though, if not more so.
7375/0:Look out!  Stingball!
7376/0:I'll go find another unit.
7376/1:We need more officers.
7377/0:Human society is now so destructive that organic life itself is an endangered species.
7378/0:Whoa -- a trap!
7379/0:I'm outta here!
7379/1:U-u-u-uh!  // panic
7379/2:Sorry -- I can't hold the position!
7380/0:I don't have enough money to pay you.  [500 credits]
7381/0:Whoa -- a trap!
7382/0:I'm outta here!
7382/1:U-u-u-uh!  // panic
7382/2:Sorry -- I can't hold the position!
7382/3:Gotta... take cover...
7382/4:This is too intense!
7382/5:I can't handle it...!
7382/6:Time to pull out...
7383/0:We've got to get out of here.  
7384/0:Somebody jumped me -- you seen anyone suspicious?
7384/1:Anybody come through here?  I'm looking to settle a score.
7385/0:Talk.
7386/0:You have your orders.
7387/0:Somebody jumped me -- you seen anyone suspicious?
7387/1:Anybody come through here?  I'm looking to settle a score.
7388/0:Talk.
7389/0:Thanks.  What are you going to do?
7390/0:It doesn't involve chatting with young women.
7391/0:I've gotta find the gob that attacked me -- any ideas?
7392/0:I've gotta find the gob that attacked me -- any ideas?
7393/0:What do you think that's all about?
7394/0:What do you think that's all about?
7395/0:So I guess you've gone rogue on us.  It's not too late to show some loyalty to the WTO.  We want you to destroy the Nassif family's greenhouse, which is in the northwest corner of the south medina.  The experimental greenhouse, a violation of WTO regulations, should lead us to Dr. Nassif. 
7396/0:
7396/1:
7396/2:
7396/3:
7396/4:
7397/0:We've just received a report of a fatality in the Galleria.  Your rescue mission was a failure.  You'll be held responsible for putting those people at risk and failing to get them both to safety.
7398/0:I'll take my chances.
7399/0:SSC can have a chopper here pretty quickly.  We just can't get word to HQ without a pilot beacon.
7400/0:
7400/1:
7400/2:
7400/3:
7401/0:So you've been here two weeks.  Any advice?
7402/0:That's right.  We're supposed to be standing guard.  Got a problem with that?
7403/0:Take me to the Mako Ballistics facility north of the city.  [400]
7404/0:You've been very helpful already.  My computer analyzed the transceiver in your temporal bone and found some interesting data files. 
7405/0:The Omar are an application of anagenetic evolution to rapid environmental change.  In solving the problem of survival on a planet disrupted by wars and self-replicating hazards, we have solved other problems.  The specimen you examined was a similar attempt to solve these problems.
7406/0:Just got out of a firefight.  Did someone come this way?
7407/0:Just got out of a firefight.  Did someone come this way?
7408/0:Welcome to the Order sanctuary for this city, Alex D.  We've been expecting you.
7409/0:We're tracking an armed suspect.  See anything?
7410/0:Sssh.  Someone might hear us.  Maybe you should go.
7411/0:We're tracking an armed suspect.  See anything?
7412/0:Even when her job took her to America, Leila never turned her back on the medina.
7413/0:I heard a strange noise.  What about you?
7414/0:Did a man come through here -- armed, in a hurry...?
7415/0:I heard a strange noise.  What about you?
7416/0:Did a man come through here -- armed, in a hurry...?
7417/0:Bud!  It's been three days.  How was your date?
7418/0:In the bull's eye today, WTO Security Chief Donna Morgan.
7419/0:A grave mistake, then.  Their children are waking up.  You, too.  You don't want to live in an engineered society, whether it's stratified like a Masonic pyramid or subsumed by the Denton-Helios panopticon.
7420/0:You see something?
7421/0:Did a woman come through here -- armed, in a hurry...?
7422/0:You see something?
7423/0:Did a woman come through here -- armed, in a hurry...?
7424/0:You see that?  I know I just did.
7425/0:What can you tell me?
7426/0:You see that?  I know I just did.
7427/0:What can you tell me?
7428/0:Know what the story is with this?
7429/0:Know what the story is with this?
7430/0:You see who wrecked this?
7431/0:You see who wrecked this?
7432/0:In time, humankind will understand and thank us.
7433/0:Where JC and Paul failed their intended purposes, you will soon succeed.
7434/0:I've got a black-market biomod canister, enables non-Piezochem functionality.  If you choose this item, we will direct you to a drop site for it after you have paid. Or you could take three scrambler grenades, which produce viral electronic transmission that affects bots, and temporarily switches their alliances.  And I've also got five multitools, used to bypass security devices, like keypads, cameras, and turrets, and to pick electronic locks.  As a preferred customer, you may purchase items at half-market price.
7435/0:I guess you're not a disciple of the Order.
7436/0:I'm too loaded down.  Hold on.
7437/0:Dedicated in life and death.
7438/0:Then be sure you talk to Chief Morgan as soon as you can.  She's in Europe right now, but she'll address you from the holocomm in her office.  Go up the stairs, hang a right, and look for the management wing on your left.
7439/0:Thanks for the information.  We need more responsible citizens like you.
7440/0:See anyone come through here?
7440/1:Some beggar's been lurking about.  Seen anything?
7441/0:I had a run-in with the Templars in the apartment building across from the mosque.  Maybe I scared them off.
7442/0:See anyone come through here?
7442/1:Some beggar's been lurking about.  Seen anything?
7443/0:Hmmm.  What do you think?
7444/0:Hmmm.  What do you think?
7445/0:What's THAT?
7446/0:What's THAT?
7447/0:Thanks for nothin'!
7448/0:Any idea what I've been seeing?
7449/0:They'll have to replace the entire inventory.  You won't have to worry about retaliation from the manager, either.  He's out of commission.
7450/0:Any idea what I've been seeing?
7451/0:You hear anything?
7452/0:The service you performed for the Omar is appreciated.  Mr. O'Rourke, the smuggler in Emerald Suites apartment 2226, was a danger to the sect.
7453/0:You hear anything?
7454/0:I think I could use someone like you in the novel I'm writing, a polished gem of a man broken loose from his fitting in society, half jewel, half stone.
7455/0:There's nothing back here for you, unless you're maintenance or custodial.
7456/0:I believe we're through.
7457/0:The guard was dead.  I'm sure of it.
7458/0:D-zero-three.
7459/0:In arcologies, you mean.  We present our message where it will do the most good -- in the enclaves of scientists, businessmen, engineers -- the blind minions of Thanatos.
7460/0:
7461/0:You may as well head out.  The club will be closing for a while.
7462/0:You watch these people in their homes?
7463/0:Alex Denton.  How does it feel to share such an infamous name?  Don't be deluded by the AI's ingenuity.  Your brother, JC, has long since been devoured by the Helios core, and if you revive Paul you will be reviving a sworn terrorist.  There is a better way.  More when you reach Cairo.
7464/0:The nanite cloud developed so gradually that we got used to it.  We got used to people dying, too.
7465/0:Didn't you get the message when I rescued Paul?  If I bring the system up, it won't be for the Templars.
7466/0:Billie, what are you talking about?  Do you know something?
7467/0:We want to return to our kind.  No more pain and experiments.
7468/0:You destroy my hydroponics equipment, and now you want to look after my daughter?  What?  You expect me to give you my parental code to the school so you can check up on her?  Hmph!
7469/0:Know where that shadow came from?
7470/0:Hold on a sec -- I'm carrying too much.
7471/0:Know where that shadow came from?
7472/0:Has someone been moving things around?
7473/0:Has someone been moving things around?
7474/0:Would you like to be?
7475/0:I'll make sure someone pays for the damage.  Can you tell me anything?
7475/1:What do you think?  Vandals?
7476/0:I have orders to let you pass, but I don't like it.
7477/0:I'll make sure someone pays for the damage.  Can you tell me anything?
7477/1:What do you think?  Vandals?
7478/0:This wasn't an accident, was it?
7478/1:Someone's gonna pay for this.  What can you tell me about the perpetrator?
7479/0:This wasn't an accident, was it?
7479/1:Someone's gonna pay for this.  What can you tell me about the perpetrator?
7480/0:I need someone to take me to the Rauchstadt neighborhood.
7481/0:Did someone tamper with it?  What's going on?
7481/1:Section 666... hacking a secure device.  See anything?
7482/0:Did someone tamper with it?  What's going on?
7482/1:Section 666... hacking a secure device.  See anything?
7483/0:We've got a chance to make it now.
7484/0:We've got to act fast.  Our destiny awaits.
7485/0:I'm just doing my job here.  Talk to someone at HQ.
7486/0:Is there a problem here?
7487/0:Excellent.  You've done much to bring peace to this neglected part of the city.
7488/0:Perhaps you fear that you will inadvertently do the bidding of the Illuminati.  Have patience.  Nothing will be the same once you have revived JC Denton.  Welcome to Antarctica, JC's sanctuary for twenty years.
7489/0:He has been working undercover at the school, with designs on a number of the top students.  Apparently he had orders to murder these children.  Fortunately, his plan was uncovered in time.
7490/0:I'm sure that Max was at Panzerwerks when the riot started.  He's never late for work.
7491/0:
7492/0:It's probably the beer.  Sure you can fly?
7493/0:Perhaps this means nothing to you, but Leila is a hero around here.  She is the one who funded the greenhouse.
7494/0:Saman understands that the human body is no machine.
7495/0:
7496/0:Could've been EMP'ed.  What do you think?
7497/0:Could've been EMP'ed.  What do you think?
7498/0:Where did that come from?
7498/1:Is someone throwing things?
7499/0:Where did that come from?
7499/1:Is someone throwing things?
7500/0:Who's got sticky fingers?
7501/0:I went up to see what was going on, and all the guards were just standing around.  I mean, really.
7502/0:Who's got sticky fingers?
7503/0:Sure, make a run at the Statue.  [500]
7504/0:This plague is all I've ever known, and I get sick so easily.
7505/0:See who turned that on?
7506/0:Admittance is by password only.
7507/0:See who turned that on?
7508/0:Sorry, you're on your own.
7509/0:See who turned that off?
7510/0:
7511/0:See who turned that off?
7512/0:You should've been here an hour ago.  They let me fire one.
7513/0:I thought we had a deal, then I see Gob-zilla comin' down the chute.  If you wanted more money, you should've said so.
7514/0:Now get to work.
7515/0:I'm afraid the school keeps its industry contracts classified, even from us.
7516/0:How many of your thoughts do you think were given to you as suggestions during your long sleep in Antarctica?
7517/0:Just fight, you dog!
7518/0:Do not spread corruption and disorder.  Acknowledge your responsibilities to your fellows and to the Earth.  Doing otherwise means you pollute the world with what Muslims have called fasad, or earthly corruption,  in following a path other than the Search.  Do not deny the call to Order that you feel in your spirit and you will help to eliminate fasad.
7519/0:They better not hurt that woman.  Mark my words.
7520/0:Yep.  Some of the best new tech.  Probably even some stuff you don't have yet.  Then again, maybe YOU don't need it.
7521/0:No society is without this conflict.  Our intention is to develop both principles and then integrate them into an open, secular society.
7522/0:I already picked up my gear.
7523/0:I'm sorry, but access is restricted.  Thank you for your interest.
7524/0:You sound like you know something I don't.
7525/0:Great, that was our only lead.  Go back and see if you can find any other clues the Omar might have left behind.  I understand your frustration though -- I don't want to waste my time saving the world until we figure out where Dr. Nassif is hiding.
7526/0:Who opened that?
7526/1:Looks like someone was poking their nose in where it doesn't belong.  See anything?
7527/0:Who opened that?
7527/1:Looks like someone was poking their nose in where it doesn't belong.  See anything?
7528/0:See who closed it?
7529/0:See who closed it?
7530/0:You must prepare -- we can offer you special resources.
7531/0:Who opened this door?
7532/0:Who opened this door?
7533/0:Yes, at last, the old hierarchies will finally be restored.
7534/0:I thought that door was supposed to be open.
7535/0:Gob-zilla's gonna eat that other gob for dinner.
7536/0:I thought that door was supposed to be open.
7537/0:The kidnapped gray -- is he safe and healthy now?
7538/0:Nothing.  But that is probably part of the admissions process -- you have to be clever enough to discover that it exists.  Right now, I need to get back to my studying.  I have only put in twelve hours today.
7539/0:
7539/1:
7539/2:
7539/3:
7540/0:Someone blew up the door!
7541/0:No....!  NO!  The Omar are destroying the Helios core!  Satisfied, Alex?  I'm mortal like you again.  Helios won't be able to save me this time, but I don't plan to be the one who needs saving.  You want to plunge the world into chaos...?  Come and take it from me.  I have reclaimed the Statue of Liberty for all of humanity.
7542/0:Someone blew up the door!
7543/0:My daughter is always sick.
7544/0:Surely the Illuminati can deal with a few crackpots.
7545/0:I was just curious about the summit.  Sorry to interrupt.
7546/0:Nevermind.  I don't want to go in.
7547/0:Security must be pretty nonexistent around here.  Is there a lot of crime?
7548/0:Closer to home now.
7549/0:What's that? //innocently
7549/1:Hello? //innocently
7550/0:Is someone there? //innocently
7550/1:What's going on? //innocently
7551/0:I think I saw something.
7551/1:That didn't look quite right.
7552/0:What was that sound?
7552/1:I think I heard something.
7553/0:I'm beginning to get suspicious.
7553/1:Again?  I wonder what's going on...
7554/0:I told you to check in with Billie first.  Apartment 454.  She will give you the elevator code.
7555/0:That's weird. //innocently
7555/1:I don't get it. //innocently
7556/0:I'm bouncing around in here like a sack of potatoes.
7557/0:What do you think they're planning?
7558/0:Who turned on that light?
7559/0:Who turned on that light?
7560/0:This is WTO Security Chief Donna Morgan.  Your were instructed to report to the air terminal.  Very well.   You can make yourself useful at the Inclinator instead.  There's been a toxic spill which has shut down operations.  The hazard flush system or a nanoformer bot that could clean up the mess, but the maintenance team is blocked from using either.  For more details, talk to the facility director in her office.
7561/0:Do you know who turned off the light?
7562/0:Do you know who turned off the light?
7563/0:Was that a person who caused that?
7564/0:You don't have to worry about Leo Jankowski.
7565/0:I think I'm going to ask for my old assignment back -- Hell's Kitchen.
7566/0:Was that a person who caused that?
7567/0:It's a little late for a seminar on my biomod architecture.
7568/0:Who riled up the birds?
7569/0:Who riled up the birds?
7570/0:
7571/0:Who spooked the rats?
7572/0:Who spooked the rats?
7573/0:Let's rip.
7574/0:What can you tell me about this place?
7575/0:Shall we conduct business?
7576/0:The guards are just SSC grunts.  They have pretty jumpy fingers where strangers are concerned.
7577/0:I can't imagine what that was... //innocently
7577/1:I wonder what that might be... //innocently
7578/0:What?! //distressed
7578/1:Who?! //distressed
7579/0:I don't like this. //a bit shaky
7579/1:This doesn't look good. //a bit shaky
7580/0:Oh my! //shocked
7580/1:Oh no! //shocked
7581/0:I guess it's nothing to worry about. //trying to reassure herself
7581/1:Well, I won't bother myself about it. //trying to reassure herself
7582/0:I told you:  We can't trust Tarsus or the WTO.  You really should come to our church and hear what the Order has to say.  Her Holiness will open your eyes. May She watch over you.
7583/0:Looks like that trespasser fled.
7584/0:I guess the thief took whatever was wanted and took off.
7585/0:Thanks again for taking care of that mess.
7586/0:Is there a problem here?
7587/0:Looks like the thug moved on.
7588/0:Phew!  I think I'm safe from that killer now. 
7589/0:I think I saw something.
7589/1:Did I see something?
7590/0:Order be praised.
7591/0:I need you to stay right here.
7592/0:They caught us with our guard down.  It won't happen again.
7593/0:Detox initiated.
7594/0:Who spooked the cat?
7595/0:Who spooked the cat?
7596/0:Thanks.
7597/0:Hey, someone set a fire.  Know who it was?
7598/0:He applied for a grant, you see.  I'm the one who handles that sort of thing for Upper Seattle.
7599/0:Hey, someone set a fire.  Know who it was?
7600/0:I've finished my search of Cairo.  I'm ready for the next destination.
7601/0:You can't stop the Templars.  There are too many of us.
7602/0:What's causing that smoke?
7603/0:What's causing that smoke?
7604/0:That sounds like it's from Mark Finley, Seattle's Minister of Culture.  Now why would he be talking to Nassif about hiding a shipment?   Is Tarsus involved in some sort of smuggling operation?
7605/0:Did you manage to hook up with Sandy?
7606/0:Any idea who left the trail of blood?
7607/0:The leaders have all fallen.  Now destroy JC Dentons's machine and we are free.  The future is waiting for you, Alex.
7608/0:Any idea who left the trail of blood?
7609/0:Huh?
7609/1:Eh?
7609/2:Hello?
7610/0:Snake-eyes all the way.
7611/0:Her office is across from mine, on the other side of the reception area.  You the guy with covert ops training?  You want to make my day?  Bring me the balance sheet for that dive nightclub.  VOX.  Down at the end of the block.
7612/0:I know I saw something.
7612/1:Did I see something?
7613/0:I think I heard something.
7613/1:Did I hear something?
7614/0:What is it?
7615/0:I just bumped into something.
7615/1:I felt something...
7616/0:
7617/0:Ouch!  That hurt! //like a petulant child
7617/1:(yelp) That's not very nice! //like a petulant child
7618/0:Venning!  I demand an answer about this problem with the fuel cells and the haptic receptors.  We've been in production for three months -- and now this??  You assured us you'd fully tested the design and had no problems.  Now we're going to lose two weeks fixing this mess.  I'm holding you personally accountable.  
7619/0:What the -- ?! //overwhelmed
7619/1:What on earth?! //overwhelmed
7620/0:Unconscious?! //panicky
7620/1:Out cold?! //panicky
7621/0:Dead?! //panicky
7621/1:Oh the horror! //panicky
7622/0:I got myself into this mess... I can face up to it.
7623/0:Poor thing!  So scared!
7623/1:Wonder why the poor thing's so upset...
7624/0:It's been damaged!
7624/1:How did this get wrecked?
7625/0:It's been destroyed!
7625/1:How did this get wrecked?
7626/0:I don't think so.  Just get me there.
7627/0:Now I just need to find this Sid Black.
7628/0:JC Denton is already there, in a manner of speaking.  He will be preparing the systems necessary for the Great Advance while we are in Cairo.
7629/0:High Augur Chen said you were in charge of handling the epidemic.
7630/0:I'll do it!  They think they can trick me into serving their illegal scheme.  The answer is no, my friend.  The answer is no.
7631/0:Dossier uploaded.  Will shoot on sight.
7632/0:Your daughter's now a Tarsus girl.  Check with the authorities before letting her move into the arcology, though.  There's been some trouble in the city.
7633/0:I'm just a bouncer.
7634/0:I think you should move to Cairo.  You could live in the medina near us.
7635/0:Great work.  The JC-Helios AI has already integrated the Aquinas protocol.
7636/0:It's disabled.  That's strange.
7636/1:I don't think this is supposed to be shut down.
7637/0:I don't think it's supposed to do that.
7637/1:Looks like a malfunction to me.
7638/0:Always "drop my birds on the curb," eh?  You can't beat the life in New Cairo.  I even had cash this time when I ran into a certain creditor of mine in the elevator.
7639/0:Give me the black market biomods. [850]
7640/0:It's on? //unsure
7640/1:I thought this was off. //unsure
7641/0:It's off? //unsure
7641/1:I thought this was on? //unsure
7642/0:Here's a key to the gate in the courtyard.  Like I said, the facility is on the north side of the city.
7643/0:It's open? //unsure
7643/1:I thought this was closed. //unsure
7644/0:Let's go.
7645/0:I took this job because it was supposed to be safe and predictable.  Maybe I was better off working for SSC.
7646/0:I make sure no one tries to sneak in.
7647/0:It's closed? //unsure
7647/1:I thought this was open. //unsure
7648/0:Is someone throwing things? //confused
7648/1:How did that happen? //confused
7649/0:I'm on Dr. Nassif's tail.  The program we came out of -- ApostleCorp -- it's based here in Cairo.
7650/0:Where did it go? //confused 
7650/1:It's missing? //confused 
7651/0:
7652/0:You've come this far -- I think it's time to finish this thing.
7653/0:Depends on if it gets me a raise.
7654/0:How did that get there? //confused 
7654/1:That's not where it should be... //confused 
7655/0:Oh no!  Looks like there's been a battle here.
7656/0:I distrust your motives.
7657/0:What makes you think that?  Why wouldn't she just leave?
7658/0:If you want to avoid confrontations in the hall, you could crawl through a vent shaft I found earlier.  It connects Klara's and Leo's apartments.  Enter the apartment on your immediate left to get to it.
7659/0:To prepare, we urge arcology residents to complete their business in the medina in the next several days in order to minimize the time they will need to spend in Old Cairo.
7660/0:The new face of hate.  They call themselves the Knights Templar and claim to be descended from Hugues de Payns and the Temple of Solomon.
7661/0:Can the housing units be repaired?
7662/0:As the time for the first ever WTO-Order summit draws near, Vera Maxwell, the Executive Commander of the SSC, runs through final preparations and strategies.
7663/0:Tax evasion, I'm pretty sure.  That small-time cheat probably keeps his books in his office on the second floor.  Bring me hard evidence against VOX, and I'll hand over a generous Citizen's Bonus.  [500 credits.]  How's that?
7664/0:The fumes hit me pretty bad.
7665/0:
7666/0:We both wanted to be artists.  I admire the way she stuck to her guns and made it big.
7667/0:Preparing internally for the battle.  Diagnostics...complete.
7668/0:Oh I see, it was just a trick.
7668/1:You can't fool me for long.
7669/0:I'll keep that in mind.
7670/0:(sigh) Ready as I'll ever be... //nervous
7670/1:I don't really want to have to do this... //nervous
7671/0:Not again... //nervous
7671/1:Once was enough... //nervous
7672/0:What are you trying to pull?  Where's your gun? //rattled
7672/1:Where's your weapon? //rattled
7673/0:Ugh.
7673/1:Unnf.
7674/0:It is hard to put up with this sometimes.
7675/0:Gotcha.
7675/1:Hey, it worked! //as if surprised
7676/0:Gotcha.
7676/1:Hey, it worked! //as if surprised
7677/0:It's over.  //with distaste
7677/1:That's finished.  //with distaste
7678/0:Survival of the fittest.  That's how the world works.
7679/0:Insolent fool.
7679/1:What a waste.
7679/2:You had to throw it all away...
7679/3:We'd had such high hopes for you...
7680/0:
7681/0:Missed!
7681/1:Oh no -- I missed!
7682/0:They'll always need us for their dirty work.  Like my brother Danny.  He cleans the bots that clean the floors up there.  How would he get to work without the Inclinator?
7683/0:Huh?
7683/1:Eh?
7683/2:Oh?
7684/0:Dr. Nassif, please report to A-17.
7685/0:
7686/0:
7687/0:Sounds like an interesting man.
7688/0:My business plan didn't have a column for "acts of terror."  Kind of messes with the Pequachino price point.
7689/0:
7690/0:
7691/0:The Order seeks peace, but can respond to violence if need be.
7692/0:Your presence is no longer required.
7693/0:Every subject has a different reaction when he or she learns the truth.
7694/0:All by yourself?
7695/0:You took care of him?  Well, you probably just saved someone's life.  He was ordered to self-destruct when he found the enemy.  This would have destroyed both of them and helped the Illuminati seize some sort of device that's supposed to make them all-powerful.
7696/0:That hurt.
7696/1:You're going to go to hell.
7697/0:That hurt.
7697/1:You're going to go to hell.
7698/0:Well, maybe you can manage to take out that machine before we freeze to death.  I don't want to find out what the hell kind of world JC Denton was gonna give us.
7699/0:Yeah?
7700/0:All structures and life within the range of the weapon appear to be reduced to cinders.  It is not known if any evacuation procedures were successful.
7701/0:Better clear out.  Pit's about to close.
7702/0:My mom said you shouldn't stare at people.
7702/1:You're looking at me awfully funny.
7703/0:He's escaping!
7703/1:He's getting away!
7704/0:My mom said you shouldn't stare at people.
7704/1:You're looking at me awfully funny.
7705/0:She's escaping!
7705/1:She's getting away!
7706/0:Phew!
7706/1:Good!
7707/0:Stop being so silly.
7707/1:(giggles)
7708/0:Come out here! //unsure
7708/1:I can't get a clear shot.
7709/0:Time again for a.... ta-a-alk BULLET!
7710/0:Stop being so silly.
7710/1:(giggles)
7711/0:(grunt) I've been hit! //panicky
7711/1:(grunt) I've been wounded! //panicky
7712/0:(groan)
7712/1:(groan)
7713/0:(groan)
7713/1:(groan) ...too much...
7714/0:(moan) I think... it's... poison...
7714/1:Oomph...
7715/0:(yells)
7715/1:Nooooo!
7716/0:I'm just here to make sure the crowd doesn't get too rowdy.
7717/0:You shouldn't be calling me Karl.
7718/0:(moan) Can't... see... //panicky
7718/1:(shriek) I'm blind! //panicky
7719/0:I think you should move to Cairo.  You could live in the medina near us.
7720/0:I do not believe she got kicked out -- We would have all heard about that by now.  It must be something else...  Maybe she is hiding...
7721/0:That was a joke.  Seekers can make jokes, can't they?
7722/0:You better get indoors.
7723/0:It's a universal faith.  You don't have to be religious to agree with the basic philosophy behind it.
7724/0:Totally.  Right now it's like every city's been divided up by gangs.
7725/0:All that, and then no real conflict in getting the pilot to land. 
7726/0:Thanks for taking care of the Mosque for us.
7727/0:I think you're not nice.
7727/1:You're dangerous.
7728/0:I think you're not nice.
7728/1:You're dangerous.
7729/0:You'd better get out of here before you get caught.
7729/1:You're really not supposed to be here.
7730/0:I'll take that from you later.  I can't carry anything else right now.  ApostleCorp must be a pretty serious threat to be a concern to the Director of the WTO.
7731/0:You'd better get out of here before you get caught.
7731/1:You're really not supposed to be here.
7732/0:(groan)
7732/1:(groan)
7733/0:Thanks again for taking care of that mess.
7734/0:Knock it off!
7734/1:STOP IT!
7735/0:Ugh.
7735/1:Umph.
7736/0:Knock it off!
7736/1:STOP IT!
7737/0:(gasp)
7738/0:Scum!
7738/1:Plebe!
7738/2:Peon!
7739/0:GO AWAY!  NOW!
7739/1:Waah!
7740/0:This is real power. 
7740/1:You don't know who or what you're dealing with.
7741/0:Hear that?  She called Red a "punk..."
7742/0:Our time will come... soon.
7742/1:The storm is gathering force.
7742/2:Soon... we will strike.
7742/3:Ah... Excellent... //mr. burns
7743/0:You could become a very powerful woman, Alex.  With biomodification technology properly regulated, you would be the forerunner of a new elite.
7744/0:(yawn)
7744/1:(cough)
7744/2:(sniff)
7744/3:(sneeze)
7745/0:Not now!
7745/1:I can't --
7746/0:
7746/1:
7746/2:
7746/3:
7747/0:Oops!
7747/1:Oh no... I'm sorry.
7748/0:Yeah?
7749/0:Of course I know about the Collapse.  If I fail to find the passenger I'm looking for, I'll be available to take you to another destination.  If so we'll leave from this landing pad.
7750/0:They really make 'em fight to the death.  Wow.
7751/0:Naw, man... Lay off that scrip'.  I'm just sellin' passes.
7752/0:Jason!
7753/0:Let me finish my run.
7754/0:Go on about your business.
7755/0:
7756/0:I'm in the middle of working on my lesson plans right now.
7757/0:I tried to get corporate headquarters interested.  What do you think happened?
7758/0:They're dealing with ordinary people, slowly infecting them with the worst kind of biomods -- black market.  As if you can really make a distinction...
7759/0:Calling someone a fanatic --
7760/0:I think you might be lost.  If you're looking for the coffeeshop, go back the way you came and go to level 107.
7761/0:I'm glad I got assigned here, and not Old Cairo, dealing with the rabble.
7762/0:GO AWAY!  NOW!
7762/1:Waah!
7763/0:I'm glad you stopped.
7763/1:Phew.  
7764/0:I'm glad you stopped.
7764/1:Phew.  
7765/0:Yes.  Over that way.
7765/1:I think something's going on over there.
7766/0:Sounds like you're having second thoughts.
7767/0:Nothing notable.
7767/1:I haven't noticed a thing.
7768/0:Lies!  I tell you -- the Church is the work of cynical conspirators.
7769/0:Hello.
7769/1:Hi there.
7770/0:Hello.
7770/1:Hi there.
7771/0:I'm going for help.
7772/0:Excuse me.
7772/1:Yes?
7773/0:I'm going for help.
7774/0:Please watch where you're going.
7774/1:Please be more careful.
7775/0:Good to see the info made a difference.  Now let's see if tracking you down myself was worth the effort.
7776/0:This is a restricted area.
7776/1:This zone is off-limits.
7777/0:Ummm... Hello? 
7777/1:Please stop staring.
7778/0:Maybe you should go lie down.
7778/1:Perhaps you should take a nap.
7779/0:Hey!  Put that away!
7779/1:Get away from me!
7780/0:Please show yourself the way out.
7781/0:Universal biomodification.  Doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, does it?  Hardly a political ideal.  Don't be fooled by JC Denton's rhetoric.  He is the mouthpiece for an AI construct, just like an Omar, just like your old classmate Leo.
7782/0:Yeah, I wouldn't have to pull so much volume if I had a branch in Lower Seattle.  What's it to you?
7783/0:I hope you can, Alex.  I sincerely hope you can.
7784/0:When will they learn?  The human organism should not be tampered with.
7785/0:test.
7786/0:
7787/0:I'm talkin' about PERSONAL SPACE, yo.
7788/0:
7788/1:
7788/2:
7788/3:
7788/4:
7789/0:I'm going to run for it.
7790/0:I'm going to run for it.
7791/0:And you've found that the Templars are a sane and reasonable employer?
7792/0:Oh my goodness!
7792/1:Heavens!
7793/0:Hey!  Watch where you're aiming.
7793/1:What do you think you're doing?
7794/0:This is a Code Yellow health advisory.
7795/0:Did I just see something?
7795/1:I saw that.  Is someone there?
7796/0:Please stop!
7796/1:I am not amused!
7797/0:Take me to Trier, Germany.
7798/0:Come back later tonight.  Tina's bringin' in the champ -- Gob-zilla.  It's gonna be Gob-zilla versus Snake-eyes.  4-to-1 odds.  Bet on Snake-eyes, you might just quadruple your money.
7799/0:You aren't scared of anything, are you?
7799/1:I hope you weren't trying to sneak up on me...
7800/0:Cut that out!
7800/1:Really!
7801/0:Huh.  All right.  Guess one good turn deserves another.  Here you go.
7802/0:Well, I've turned your heart just in time.  Now make sure that both Dentons have been killed, then step into JC Denton's machine inside the Statue so that the ducts will be primed with your nanite-capsid architecture.  My scientists will do the rest.
7803/0:When he came to us, he made the earth move according to whim.  He sculpted a habitat for himself, near to our colony on the ice.
7804/0:Hm.  A mysterious racket.
7804/1:Don't need cochlear implants to hear THAT...
7805/0:This area is restricted!
7805/1:You are trespassing!
7806/0:Aaa!  Hm, ran into something...
7807/0:Really, I find this behavior irritating.
7807/1:Stop looking at me!
7808/0:(grunt) Better hope I don't find you...
7808/1:Ow!  Real fair!  Where are you?
7809/0:Please take your antics elsewhere.
7809/1:I am not impressed.
7810/0:Stop it!
7810/1:Get that away from me!
7811/0:Quarterly gymnasium equipment requests are due at the end of the month.  Be sure to submit the proper forms or else we will not be able to fulfill your requisitions until next quarter.
7812/0:What is wrong with you?
7812/1:Are you out of your mind?
7813/0:How dare you!
7813/1:I've had just about enough of your insolence.
7814/0:What's the WTO's stake in ApostleCorp?
7815/0:Let me finish my run.
7816/0:
7817/0:You'll regret this!
7817/1:That's it! // infuriated
7818/0:Every time I look at a public terminal, we're one step closer to all-out war.
7819/0:
7820/0:
7821/0:Have you ever considered what is unique about post-Collapse society?  Hmmm?  Trans-territoriality.  Most political entities coexist on a global scale.  The WTO has its enclaves, we have our settlements and churches.
7822/0:So you're serious -- leaving all your work at Tarsus behind so you can join this church.  How do you know we can trust THEM?  They attacked the apartments and put us in danger.
7823/0:You don't want all the details in one dose -- trust me.  Why don't you come downstairs to meet the other trainees.  Refer to the map you found of the facility.  Billie Adams you know from Chicago.  Check in with her in Apartment 454 on your way down.
7824/0:Another one lost!  We owe these creatures more than this...
7825/0:I still don't have any money.
7826/0:I don't know how much longer I can stand breathing the air out here in the medina.
7827/0:Hurry up.  I get bored just sittin' like this.
7828/0:I know about your bag of tricks.
7828/1:I'm not falling for THAT.
7829/0:Think you can hide behind a smokescreen, huh?
7830/0:Must be a diversion...
7831/0:Oh my! Blood...
7832/0:Most of us DON'T reside inside the well-guarded walls of an enclave.  Most of us would be surprised to see a uniformed officer on our street, outside our business, on our way to the market.
7833/0:SSC can put me in jail, but we are the majority.  If the authorities won't solve this problem, the people of Trier will.
7834/0:Hm, a shadow...
7835/0:(coughs)  Pretty thick today, isn't it?
7836/0:A fire!  Well...
7837/0:Citizens, we have been accused of over-engineering our economy.  Well, this is the legacy we inherited from JC Denton.  JC Denton... the solitary criminal mind that precipitated the Great Collapse and showed us just how fragile the old system was.  "But how?" you ask.  "Just a rumor," you say.  No.  My investigators have uncovered proof underground at Area 51 that he was NOT working for the United Nations and in fact that there never WAS a global terror network.  He acted alone.  Even the recent Chicago disaster pales in comparison to his crimes.  Trust the WTO's cautious policies.  They protect civilization from madness itself.
7838/0:Thanks for your cooperation.  C'mon in.
7839/0:Gee -- is that smoke?  
7840/0:Must've been some fighting...
7841/0:There is nothing more for you to do here.
7842/0:They don't pay much attentioin to you if you stay out of their way.  They were after the leadership.
7843/0:My heavens!  A dead creature...
7844/0:Yep.  Some of the best new tech.  Probably even some stuff you don't have yet.  Then again, maybe YOU don't need it.
7845/0:Unlocking your sabr can also help you achieve greater Order.  As the Muslims before you who revered this attribute, you must be steadfast and you must be patient.  Sometimes the Search will be difficult.  Obstacles within yourself and people who do not understand may stand in your way.  Self-discipline and faith will keep you on the path.
7846/0:My friend here just hasn't been exposed to good coffee.  It won't take long to change her mind.
7847/0:Please deposit credits.
7848/0:There's nothing back here for you, unless you're maintenance or custodial.
7849/0:
7850/0:The Order is an intolerant cult.  They hate multinational corporations and the private security forces that protect them.
7851/0:You had better take another look at the main chamber.  You were just teleported almost a half a mile.  I'm not surprised, though.  I was able to construct the Black Gate teleporter only with instructions from Helios.
7852/0:Stop the hate.  Report all Templar activity -- before it's too late for YOUR community.
7853/0:Yeah?
7854/0:Find the Aquinas specification, upload it to our scientists, then neutralize J.C. Denton and destroy his machine.  The world doesn't need any new gods.
7855/0:So you're on the WTO payroll now, huh?
7856/0:Wonder what startled it...
7857/0:My, my... signs of violence...
7857/1:Someone around here threw a tantrum.
7858/0:Our work is invisible, but just.  Humankind is well-served.
7859/0:It's completely destroyed!
7859/1:Wow, someone really did a number on this thing.
7860/0:At least the SSC is coming to bail us out.
7861/0:At last, Order has triumphed.
7862/0:Looks like a malfunction.
7863/0:Someone must've disabled it.
7864/0:
7865/0:Wait a minute -- that wasn't on.
7866/0:I guess that's a fair price.  Here you go.  [750]
7867/0:Don't worry about me -- I can take care of myself.
7868/0:Hey, someone turned it off...
7869/0:The light's on... well...
7870/0:Impressive work, taking down that bot.
7871/0:Gee, someone turned the light off.
7872/0:Tarsus Tracking Report 1242 -- Klara Sparks.  Subject eliminated in Cairo.  She'd allied herself with the WTO, who'd placed her high in the ranks, owing to her abilities.  Intel suggests that Dumier had recognized her special attributes as well, and seemed to be treating her as a special protege, but apparently even that was not enough to protect her from righteous termination.
7873/0:My, my -- someone left it open...
7874/0:I think I could use someone like you in the novel I'm writing, a polished gem of a woman broken loose from her fitting in society, half jewel, half stone.
7875/0:If you're asking about the Inclinator, I DON'T KNOW.  Some sort of toxic spill.  We're on it.
7876/0:I paid your fine to Sophia Sak.  You're free to pick up your jet from the landing pad.
7877/0:This is what you've signed on for -- bloody mercenary work for the Templars?   I thought you were better than that, Billie.
7878/0:Come on, I'll be back-- you know this is home to me, Cindy. 
7879/0:Whatever.  Just find my daughter!
7880/0:I'm ready.  Let's go.
7881/0:Number 22, Heron's Loft, right?
7882/0:Just some things I scavenged from a couple of thugs a while back.  You with the raiding party or something?  I guess you've been pretty good about avoiding my people so far.  I'm selling some if this stuff, if you're interested.
7883/0:No exchange possible.
7884/0:It's too bad it had to end that way.
7885/0:(sigh)
7885/1:(grrr)
7885/2:(clears throat)
7886/0:Naw, man... Lay off that scrip'.  I'm just sellin' passes.
7887/0:Please...
7887/1:Don't do that.
7888/0:Oh God...  He's really dead, isn't he?
7889/0:I don't wish to be bumped.
7889/1:Careful.
7889/2:Don't touch me.
7890/0:What do you see?  A piece of yourself, perhaps?
7890/1:Soon you and everyone else will be like me.
7890/2:It's not so strange to have my form of awareness.  Trust me...
7891/0:Please deport yourself with honor, my seeker.
7891/1:That isn't advisable behavior.
7891/2:Stop.  Calm your erratic heart.
7892/0:Someone must've closed it.
7893/0:Stop.  No further.
7893/1:Turn back.
7894/0:Knocked out... I wonder what's going on...
7895/0:My seeker, I don't understand.
7895/1:You can't seriously be threatening me.
7895/2:I.... hope I wasn't wrong about you.
7896/0:A body!  Oh no!
7897/0:I hope it doesn't come to that, but, yes, I am tired of paying for their crimes.  Every time they mess with the plant, it comes out of my paycheck.
7898/0:Careful.
7898/1:What was the meaning of THAT?
7898/2:Yes -- I feel pain.  Just like everyone else.  Satisfied?
7899/0:(gasp)  It can't be.  Oh my God...
7900/0:That's quite enough.
7900/1:Don't aggravate me.  Not now.
7901/0:Quit!  Hey, who's doing that?
7902/0:You shouldn't bring politics into it.  It's a job, not a calling.
7903/0:Enough ogling.  Leave me be.
7903/1:It's time for you to go on about your business.
7903/2:You stare and stare.  I begin to question your intentions.
7904/0:Gee, did someone take it?
7905/0:Someone needs to learn to cover their tracks...
7906/0:Oh?
7906/1:Well!  What was that?
7907/0:Hm.  I wonder.
7907/1:Better stay alert...
7907/2:Okay... // suspicious
7908/0:Making weapons for a bunch of Renaissance-fair types wasn't my first choice of profession -- but jobs are pretty scarce these days.
7909/0:Maybe I spoke too soon.
7909/1:Hm.  More curious activity.
7910/0:The counter-agent sounds like something that would interest the villagers.  How do I get into this facility?
7911/0:I believe we're through.
7912/0:Please get to your destination.  Your child may be in class or in the lab.
7913/0:I'm the Templar Grand Master.
7914/0:One unidentified helicopter brings everything to a screeching halt?  Are you kidding?  Just shoot it down and move on.
7915/0:No money.  I'd have to go on foot.  With thermal vision, they'd pick me out on the desert plain like a pilot beacon.
7916/0:Are you trying to provoke me?
7916/1:Fool!  With my power, I could shatter you into dust!
7917/0:I've got my eye on you.
7918/0:Huh?
7918/1:Eh?
7918/2:Hello?
7919/0:Listen to your conscience, Alex.  Is this what you want?
7919/1:The seeker hesitates.  But why?
7920/0:Go!
7921/0:This is your first warning.
7921/1:Don't think I won't turn on you, Alex.  I will proceed alone if necessary.
7921/2:Obey me, seeker!
7921/3:I won't allow myself to be nettled.
7922/0:I've cleared out the Mosque, so it's safe for you to leave.
7923/0:Cease this instant!
7923/1:Obey!
7923/2:I'm out of patience.
7924/0:Huh.  Guess I'm on the wrong track.
7924/1:Oh well.
7925/0:Stay with me, Alex.  We need each other.
7925/1:Starighten up.  I can't ally myself with a loose cannon.
7926/0:Very well.  It was nothing.
7926/1:Had myself worried there...
7927/0:Not now!
7927/1:Let me deal with this first.
7928/0:Rotten luck.
7928/1:Darn.
7929/0:Yes -- this is the Cairo branch of your old alma-mater, curiously geared toward younger children rather than covert security.  There should be some clues about ApostleCorp inside.  You should make a thorough search of the premises.
7930/0:Not what I intended...
7930/1:Something must be wrong -- I'm making mistakes.
7931/0:That looked like Alex...
7931/1:Wonder what Alex is up to...
7932/0:Greetings.
7933/0:Unconscionable behavior!  I won't stand for it.
7934/0:What's the WTO's stake in ApostleCorp?
7935/0:And Mako Ballistics is reporting that terrorists have infiltrated their Redmond facility and have stolen the plans for a weapon prototype.  The chief engineer was killed in the attack.
7936/0:Hello.
7936/1:Greetings, seeker.
7937/0:Guess the murderer took off.
7938/0:Yes...?
7938/1:Somebody there?
7938/2:Well!  I'll just take a look, then.
7939/0:It's rough, but we can't give in.
7940/0:One step at a time...
7940/1:Hm.  No luck so far...
7940/2:Let's see...
7941/0:I've got some elite commandos down there skirmishing with paladins.  They've been instructed not to harm you.
7942/0:Really!
7942/1:How dare you!  You're gonna answer for this!
7942/2:Aha!
7943/0:You're caught!  Hear me?
7943/1:I've had it with your games!
7944/0:I need to calm down.
7945/0:I heard that some of the striking workers broke into a meeting and kidnapped Her Holiness -- can you believe it?
7946/0:Or "private negotiations."
7947/0:Sid Black.  Harrier pilot.  Best flyer in the Western Hemisphere.  I drop my birds on the curb.  Spread it around.  I'm looking for another contract to get out of this town.
7948/0:You're done here.
7949/0:I feel like such a fool in this costume.
7950/0:Guess I'll find my pilot and consider your request.
7951/0:Your efforts have succeeded.
7952/0:Our protection is our own responsibility, and that's why Mako Ballistics offers handheld weapons to suit any household budget or security threat.
7953/0:You have a point there.
7954/0:Let me finish my run.
7955/0:I guess so.
7956/0:Nothing to see here.  Move along.
7957/0:Over there, my friend...
7958/0:Oh?  Bribes for what?
7959/0:He's right over there.  Just tap him on the shoulder and ask him to step outside.
7960/0:I do not have that knowledge.
7961/0:I'll take it from here, thanks.
7962/0:Nobodies.  I'm surrounded by nobodies.
7963/0:Wooo!
7963/1:Sheeesh!
7964/0:Well!  A fight.
7964/1:Shall we talk it over?  Ha, just a little humor...
7964/2:You forced my hand...
7965/0:Yes.  It's a simple repair.  I just seem to have left Trier without any multitools.
7966/0:A real shame, Alex.
7967/0:There's nothing wrong with being human.  Apparently, you lost sight of that long ago.
7968/0:
7969/0:A fight to the death, is it?
7969/1:Not again...
7970/0:Is it really worth it?  Just give up...
7971/0:May as well take the advantage...
7972/0:Sure, make a run at the Statue.  [2000]
7973/0:It has been a long wait, but well worth it.
7974/0:Oooo, sneaky...
7974/1:Come out, come out...
7975/0:Why did you turn against JC?
7976/0:Today's forecast calls for a medium airborne nanite debris level.
7977/0:So I just keep working here, like nothing happened?
7978/0:What's the passenger's name?
7979/0:
7980/0:I don't have time for more riddles.
7981/0:
7982/0:(moan) Was that... poison?!
7983/0:(moan) Was that... poison?!
7984/0:(moan) Was that... poison?!
7985/0:I've been shot at before -- I didn't like it.
7986/0:(moan) Was that... poison?!
7987/0:
7988/0:(moan) Was that... poison?!
7989/0:
7990/0:(moan) Was that... poison?!
7991/0:Scared of little old me?
7991/1:Change your mind?
7992/0:
7992/1:
7992/2:
7992/3:
7992/4:
7992/5:
7993/0:(moan) Was that... poison?!
7994/0:You know me, Alex.  I finish what I start!
7995/0:(moan) Was that... poison?!
7996/0:Critical mistake, I'm afraid.
7996/1:Want a piece of me?
7996/2:Missed me...
7997/0:I can't see!
7998/0:Oh no!
7998/1:Oops.  Oh, heavens...
7999/0:I can't see!
8000/0:(grunt)
8000/1:(grunt)
8001/0:I took a peek at the club's records.
8002/0:(grunt) Mean shot, Alex.
8003/0:Identification:  Subject Alex Denton.
8004/0:(groan)
8004/1:(groan) Not good...
8005/0:Here -- take the silencer.  It's not doing me any good.
8006/0:(moan)
8007/0:Mr. O'Rourke will see you.
8008/0:But --
8009/0:(moan) How'd they do this to us, Alex?
8010/0:(gasp) (cough)
8010/1:(gasp) Shoot, poison...
8011/0:Well, when I suggested that my people conduct their own search he brushed me off.  This is quite a turnaround.  I hope he's right about you.
8012/0:No business can prosper without protection against crime.
8013/0:I'm ready to pay well, if the pilot's worth it.
8014/0:I guess that's a fair price.  Here you go.  [750]
8015/0:What for?
8016/0:
8017/0:Just let me know if you hear any news about you-know-what.
8018/0:Yes -- our researchers have been observing your training and living quarters.  Don't be alarmed.  Such precautions are standard procedure before giving trainees their corporate assignments.
8019/0:I'm glad I got assigned here, and not Old Cairo, dealing with the rabble.
8020/0:
8021/0:I'll take the silencer. [600]
8022/0:I'm sorry.  They don't pay me to interface with the public.
8023/0:
8024/0:I wonder what's taking security so long...?
8025/0:Some scientists.  It was more like a raid.
8026/0:I can't see!
8027/0:Maybe I am.
8028/0:I can't see!
8029/0:I cannot see!
8030/0:Not just the sound barrier.  She can see us.
8031/0:Don't think I won't put up a fight!
8032/0:I can't see!
8033/0:Man, you think you know someone, then they start making a little money.
8034/0:I can't see!
8035/0:Maybe you should look for an alternate route.  This room might have a ceiling vent or something.
8036/0:I can't see!
8037/0:I can't see!
8038/0:I can't see!
8039/0:I doubt it.  They'd have made an announcement.
8040/0:
8041/0:I can't see!
8042/0:I can't see!
8043/0:
8044/0:I hope you rot in hell.
8045/0:The WTO and Order have long been at odds.  Why the sudden flare-up in Trier?
8046/0:The children are in danger.
8047/0:You support the new economy epitomized by Pequod's regulated, health-inspected coffee plantations, which have brought jobs and fair pay to tens of thousands.
8048/0:No one knew that name.  By the 2050's, communications protocols had become successively more comprehensive and classified, until there was only one Protocol, synonymous with all economic activity yet managed by a very small group of people.
8049/0:Friend.
8050/0:Pretty thick today, isn't it?
8051/0:Trust me.  You and I must be the best Tarsus has to offer right now.
8052/0:You're well aware that some coffee chains use polymerized flavor additives, freeze-dried beans, even coffee proteins that have been synthesized by bacteria.
8053/0:Alex, if you're trying to get to Lower Seattle, you're stuck. That toxic spill needs to be cleaned up before the Inclinator can be reactivated.  No one there seems equal to the task.  The WTO would certainly appreciate it if you could help out.
8054/0:
8055/0:So this is the end of Apostlecorp?
8056/0:These scientists will be made quiet permanently.  They will end once we are free.
8057/0:Maybe I can help out.  I'm on my way to the arcology.
8058/0:Thank you.  You've put my mind at ease.
8059/0:
8060/0:You saved us!  What a couple of days.  First I see my daughter Mina saved from the plague by a miracle, now this.
8061/0:Thanks.
8062/0:Is that all you've got?
8063/0:People lash out when their struggles overwhelm them.  I am not angry at those who have libelled and slandered my office.  I feel compassion for the pain they must feel -- that we all feel -- in dealing with Plague-11.  But we must stand together and not let the tragedy divide us in our times of need.
8064/0:Is that all you've got?
8065/0:She has the same occipital implants as you do.  Interesting.
8066/0:Go down to the landing pad.  I'll send word to Sid to meet you at the jet.
8067/0:Is that all you've got?
8068/0:Is that all you've got?
8069/0:Is that all you have got?
8070/0:I'm glad we found an agreeable solution.
8071/0:Is that all you've got?
8072/0:Is that all you've got?
8073/0:Is that all you've got?
8074/0:Is that all you've got?
8075/0:
8075/1:
8076/0:Is that all you've got?
8077/0:I just spot faces.  They didn't tell me what you did.
8078/0:
8079/0:Don't let yourself become a pawn, Alex.  You can make up your own mind.
8080/0:The victims were the parents of Leila Nassif.  This was a deliberate assassination carried out by paramilitaries.
8081/0:You're trespassing.  Leave.
8082/0:We've got a dangerous prisoner in custody.
8083/0:My paladins, today you will be tested.  All guards will be on the highest state of alert.  We are no longer invisible, and our enemies are closing in.  Protect the compound and the materials stolen from Panzerwerks at all costs.  With them, we will clothe each Soldier of Purity in exoskeletal armor and assure swift victory.
8084/0:Yes?  Do you have the password?
8085/0:Seek the way, my friend.
8086/0:Is that all you've got?
8087/0:Is that all you've got?
8088/0:You've been treated fairly.  In the post-Collapse world, every stable organization is a secret society.  To be visible is to be a target.  Don't blame ApostleCorp for a system we didn't create.
8089/0:Nooo....
8089/1:It's over...
8090/0:That's the main entrance.  You either have to get your hands on the door code or blast your way in with some kind of explosive.
8091/0:Nooo....
8091/1:It's over...
8092/0:Nooo....
8092/1:It's over...
8093/0:Nooo....
8093/1:It's over...
8094/0:Is that all you have got?
8094/1:Nooo....
8095/0:Nooo....
8095/1:It's over...
8096/0:Nooo....
8096/1:It's over...
8097/0:Nooo....
8097/1:It's over...
8098/0:You killed him?
8099/0:Read the pit, now.  Use your head!
8100/0:I wish EVERYONE could be that civilized when they get mugged. 
8101/0:Sounds easy enough.  Do you want to follow me through?
8102/0:How?  The facility's being locked down and evacuated.
8103/0:They'll probably make a bundle, too.  So that's why they dropped out of sight?
8104/0:The leaders have all fallen.  Now destroy JC Dentons's machine and we are free.
8105/0:
8106/0:Very well.  Alex, may I give you some advice?
8107/0:Okay, I'll shut up.  I'm sure you have your own worries.
8108/0:Leave me alone!
8109/0:People didn't know what was happening -- the system just started to open fire.
8110/0:Nooo....
8110/1:It's over...
8111/0:Nooo....
8111/1:It's over...
8112/0:Nooo....
8112/1:It's over...
8113/0:Nooo....
8113/1:It's over...

8114/1:
8115/0:(moan)
8115/1:(groan)
8115/2:(grunt)
8116/0:Not at all.  We are humankind's servants not their puppeteers.  We knew that human society could not respond to a single voice, so we engineered these organizations.  With these fronts, we can optimally lead civilization toward a bright future.
8117/0:(moan)
8117/1:(groan)
8117/2:(grunt)
8118/0:Instruction set decoded.   Integrating unfamiliar components.  Yes, continue.  Four others.
8119/0:JC is waiting.  He needs to establish an Aquinas hub and transmit your profile.  How can I help?
8120/0:(moan)
8120/1:(groan)
8120/2:(grunt)
8121/0:A well-designed psychological tool.
8122/0:(moan)

8122/2:(grunt)
8123/0:(moan)
8123/1:(groan)
8123/2:(grunt)
8124/0:I will notify the SSC.  They will want to investigate the apartment.
8125/0:(moan)
8125/1:(groan)
8125/2:(grunt)
8126/0:Thanks, I'll take the Glass Destabilizer.
8127/0:Well!  Someone new in the medina.  Don't worry about catching the plague at my little coffee stand.  We are a high-priority zone for the bots, and we sterilize our equipment with infrasound.
8128/0:Well, I'd make it worth a certain someone's while, that's for sure.  [300 credits]  Why do you ask?  Know anything about government databases?
8129/0:Sure you don't want to reconsider?  You could become a very powerful man, Alex.  With biomodification technology properly regulated, you would be the forerunner of a new elite.
8130/0:When did you turn into such a liberal?  If people end up working crappy jobs on a plantation, it's because they're lazy.  They're lucky Pequod's employs them at all.  
8131/0:Yeah, it's great.  I'm a walking tank.
8132/0:I don't know how much more I can take.  I just received word that my cousin Eeva was murdered. It probably was a result of Templar plot at the Cairo Tarsus where she was a student.
8133/0:
8134/0:I can't wait to see what the Regional Office has to say.  They told me it was impossible for us to go head-to-head with Pequod's.
8135/0:Who are YOU?
8136/0:Glad I could help.
8137/0:
8138/0:Just taking a break.
8139/0:We will follow this breaking news story and bring you new developments to you as they happen.

8143/2:(grunt)
8144/0:(moan)
8144/1:(groan)
8144/2:(grunt)
8145/0:So, as the leaders of two of the world's most influential and powerful organizations prepare to make history, they will not need to worry about security concerns.
8146/0:Thank you, sir.  Move along now.
8147/0:(moan)
8147/1:(groan)
8147/2:(grunt)
8148/0:The Omar are an application of anagenetic evolution to rapid environmental change.  In solving the problem of survival on a planet disrupted by wars and self-replicating hazards, we have solved other problems.  The specimen you examined was a similar attempt to solve these problems.
8149/0:(moan)
8149/1:(groan)
8149/2:(grunt)
8150/0:Nonsense.
8151/0:Oomph.
8151/1:(grunt)
8152/0:Here is a line from the Salesman's Handbook: "Promise them the world but always dangle it just out of reach."
8153/0:Oomph.
8153/1:(grunt)
8154/0:Oomph.
8154/1:(grunt)
8155/0:Oomph.
8155/1:(grunt)
8156/0:SSC was not prepared to deal with this...
8157/0:Your life is out of balance, too focused on objects and acquisition.  Shed the fear and greed that drives you.  Reconnect with the inner order that you have denied for so long.
8158/0:Sure.
8159/0:Actually, I already talked to Miss Withers.
8160/0:Sure.
8161/0:Know how this got busted?
8162/0:Know how this got busted?
8163/0:What about the rest of the weapons?
8164/0:You see what caused that malfunction?
8165/0:You see what caused that malfunction?
8166/0:(grunt)
8166/1:Oomph...
8167/0:Know why this is disabled?
8168/0:Oomph.
8168/1:(grunt)
8169/0:Know why this is disabled?
8170/0:Oomph.
8170/1:(grunt)
8171/0:Why's this on?
8172/0:Oomph.
8172/1:(grunt)
8173/0:Why's this on?
8174/0:Oomph.
8174/1:(grunt)
8175/0:Why's this off?
8176/0:Oomph.
8176/1:(grunt)
8177/0:Why's this off?
8178/0:Match 8!  Bad news -- the champ's been cooked in her own crib.  Gob-zilla is no more!  But house rules will provide.  Reigning trainer gets a free substitution.  Four-to-one odds stand.  Buy-in is the house minimum.  [100 credits.]
8179/0:Oomph.
8179/1:(grunt)
8180/0:Oomph.
8180/1:(grunt)
8181/0:Pleasure doing business with you.
8182/0:(gasp)
8183/0:(gasp)
8184/0:We have tried to spread our word quietly, but too many have fallen under the spell of this corrupt technology.  Since when is strength more important than aspiration?  Since when is the mind more important that the pursuit of wisdom?  Hear us, citizens!  In times to come, you will thank us for our bravery.
8185/0:More uptown feebs every day...
8186/0:
8187/0:And you're going to help the learning process by killing me?
8188/0:Chief Morgan?  You wanted to see me?
8189/0:Ha ha.
8190/0:Yes.  My enemies seek to establish States, but they forget to heed Plato's good advice -- do not fail to convince the children that the gods are incapable of lying.  But the children's eyes are open.  Are you ready to exorcise the second souls of modified humans, young Knight?
8191/0:Very good.  I will allow the jet to leave.  Why do you need a pilot?
8192/0:Perhaps it was necessary, perhaps in the end our kind will be saved another way.
8193/0:The air's full of toxic nanite debris, decades-old fallout from the Collapse, they say. They keep dragging in more villagers -- a pretty pitiful sight.
8194/0:Check around over there.
8194/1:I think something's going on over there.
8195/0:Check around over there.
8195/1:I think something's going on over there.
8196/0:I think I saw something over there.
8196/1:Looked like something was going on there.
8197/0:I think I saw something over there.
8197/1:Looked like something was going on there.
8198/0:(gasp)
8199/0:I saw some chick over there.
8200/0:(gasp)
8201/0:I saw some chick over there.
8202/0:(gasp)
8203/0:I saw some guy over there.
8204/0:(gasp)

8210/0:(gasp)
8211/0:Hey, Red, what're we gonna do about this lady?
8212/0:Mina, huh?  I saw her name in the school's recruitment database.  I moved her to the "accepted" category.
8213/0:(gasp)
8214/0:(gasp)
8215/0:To activate the Gate, you will need to turn on a backup generator on the top floor and then upload the Sequencing Module from the Gate Control Room.
8216/0:That bot is pretty scary.  I have never seen one shoot at people before...
8217/0:(gasp)
8218/0:Move!  Get out of there -- gas!
8219/0:Today's armor is one-size-fits-all.  You're just a unit of force in a big military machine.
8220/0:How do I get there?
8221/0:
8222/0:
8223/0:People are edgy because a few students are missing.  I am not all that worried because I know Jennifer is too smart to let anything really terrible happen.
8224/0:Well, I'm sorry, but if you're looking for someone to --
8225/0:The average citizen in a society of billions is never free, whether because of tyranny or simply because of the contrast between his small size and the size of the government.
8226/0:I'll take that as a slap in the face.  Don't be a fool, Alex.  Do you really think that the Dentons will have any use for you once their technology is imposed on humanity?  It will be a nanite plague worse than the one in Cairo, and you will be responsible.
8227/0:Guy hit me... then headed over there.
8227/1:I was attacked by this guy -- then he took off.

8229/1:I was attacked by this guy -- then he took off.
8230/0:A lady hit me... then headed over there.
8231/0:The bots are fine.  It's cracked processors in the housing units that have prevented me from bringing them on-line.  JC warned me that the eutactic nature of the Statue reconstruction would require him to drop the temperature, but this is quite extraordinary.
8232/0:A lady hit me... then headed over there.
8233/0:I can't hit!
8233/1:Can't believe I missed!
8234/0:I felt something.  Maybe check over there.
8235/0:I can't hit!
8235/1:Can't believe I missed!
8236/0:I felt something.  Maybe check over there.
8237/0:I can't hit!
8237/1:Can't believe I missed!
8238/0:Nothing unusual here.
8238/1:No, sorry.
8238/2:Dunno.
8239/0:
8240/0:I can't hit!
8240/1:Can't believe I missed!
8241/0:Nothing unusual here.
8241/1:No, sorry.
8241/2:Dunno.
8242/0:Oh -- you the guy with covert ops training?  You want to make my day?  Bring me the balance sheet for that dive nightclub.  VOX.  Down at the end of the block.
8243/0:I cannot hit!
8243/1:I cannot believe I missed!
8244/0:Hi. 
8244/1:Sup.
8244/2:Hey.
8244/3:Yo.
8245/0:
8246/0:I can't hit!

8250/1:Can't believe I missed!
8251/0:I can't hit!
8251/1:Can't believe I missed!
8252/0:I saw another special ops type, but she's assigned to Luminon Saman.  I'd like to know what that's all about.
8253/0:Young enemy, thy name is Pliable.  How quickly you kindle a faith in a brother you never knew.
8254/0:As you wish.  How fortunate that we found each other.  We've both lost someone -- but now, with each other's help, maybe our luck will change.
8255/0:
8256/0:I have good days and bad days.
8257/0:I have a good memory.
8258/0:Lordy, this place is for real.
8259/0:You said it wasn't gonna work, too.  Then you said it was gonna get us jobs.  You've said EVERYTHING ten times over.  You call that predicting the future?
8260/0:My main character, he's going to be extremely powerful but conflicted.
8261/0:Hi.
8261/1:Sup.
8261/2:Hey.
8261/3:Yo.
8262/0:Hi.
8262/1:Sup.
8262/2:Hey.
8262/3:Yo.
8263/0:You trying to make a quick buck or something?
8264/0:Two words -- gob fights.  I'm not kidding.  Every night at the Greasel Pit, on the other side of the Inclinator tunnel.
8265/0:Can I borrow a few credits?
8265/1:Wanna hear about my weekend?
8266/0:The brief claims that the Arcology Chairman suppressed research that could have cured the plague, and that you can testify accordingly.
8267/0:
8268/0:Can I borrow a few credits?
8268/1:Wanna hear about my weekend?
8269/0:I can't hit!
8269/1:Can't believe I missed!
8270/0:Nope.
8270/1:Sorry.
8271/0:I can't hit!
8271/1:Can't believe I missed!
8272/0:Nope.
8272/1:Sorry.
8273/0:I heard she turned it on.
8274/0:This city is lost.  Toxic air and fanatics enforcing martial law.
8275/0:I'm just getting warmed up.
8276/0:Please?
8276/1:Aw, c'mon...
8277/0:Wisdom must first be human.  You must start with what a human sees and feels.  But wisdom must also be knowledgeable, logical, and fair to billions of other beings.
8278/0:I know you're just software.  Probably have holocoms all over the world...
8279/0:You could be telling the truth.  Who knows?  Tell me more about your faith.
8280/0:You will bring about the dawn of a new era.
8281/0:I'm just getting warmed up.
8282/0:Please?
8282/1:Aw, c'mon...
8283/0:I'm just getting warmed up.
8284/0:See ya.
8284/1:That's enough.
8285/0:Yes, I watched you.  In time you'll see that it was all worth it.
8286/0:I'm just getting warmed up.
8287/0:See ya.
8287/1:That's enough.
8288/0:I am just getting warmed up.
8289/0:I'm just getting warmed up.
8290/0:I'm just getting warmed up.
8291/0:I wiped out the leadership of all three factions, as you suggested.  Now all we have to do is destroy the machine inside the Statue.
8292/0:I'm just getting warmed up.
8293/0:Can never be too safe.
8294/0:Thanks for the good news.
8295/0:People are edgy because a few students are missing.  I'm not all that worried because I know Jennifer's too smart to let anything really terrible happen.
8296/0:
8297/0:
8298/0:I'd prefer it if you'd keep your distance until you've been purified.
8299/0:Panzerwerks did not take kindly to our efforts to open their eyes to the harm they are causing the Earth.
8300/0:Here you go.  The credit will be invalidated if we find out that you're lying.
8301/0:Very funny.
8301/1:Knock it off.
8301/2:That's enough.
8302/0:They just hired me -- I'm one of the bouncers.
8303/0:Very funny.
8303/1:Knock it off.
8303/2:That's enough.
8304/0:Watch where you're going.
8304/1:Stand back.
8304/2:Outta my way.
8304/3:Sor-ry.  Guess I better move out of the way next time.
8304/4:Ow.  Watch where you're going.
8304/5:Tryin' to pick my pocket or what?
8305/0:Watch where you're going.
8305/1:Stand back.
8305/2:Outta my way.
8306/0:Where I come from, this is how you start a fight.
8306/1:You're about to make a new enemy...
8306/2:Either your aim or your judgment is terrible.
8307/0:Where I come from, this is how you start a fight.
8307/1:You're about to make a new enemy...
8307/2:Either your aim or your judgment is terrible.
8308/0:Go find someone else to gaze at.
8308/1:I don't like being looked at like that.
8308/2:Stop staring at me.
8308/3:It makes me nervous when people stare.
8308/4:You lookin' at ME?
8309/0:What a strange day.  All this commotion at the terminal.
8310/0:Go find someone else to gaze at.
8310/1:I don't like being looked at like that.
8310/2:Stop staring at me.
8311/0:I just want to get back to Old Cairo.
8312/0:Oh, sure, sure.  I might end up being the first QueeQueg's manager ever to do business inside a WTO enclave.  That's worth SOMETHING.  Here you go.
8313/0:Take your show somewhere else.
8313/1:Okay, comedian, knock it off.
8313/2:I don't have the patience for your weirdness today.  Get lost.
8313/3:Are you nuts or what?
8313/4:Good way to get yourself arrested.
8313/5:Hey, that's out of line.
8314/0:Take your show somewhere else.
8314/1:Okay, comedian, knock it off.
8314/2:I don't have the patience for your weirdness today.  Get lost.
8315/0:I got myself in here, didn't I?
8316/0:I have lived here all my life.  Trier has seen a lot of history, but nothing like this.
8317/0:I've heard stories about The Collapse.  They scared me.
8318/0:We're seeing some aberrant behaviors in the target locking mechanism in Project Serpentine.  It looks like there might be something off with the halonics.  Take a look and let me know what you find.
8319/0:Never fear.  Dr. Todd has found a non-lethal way to remove your biomods.
8320/0:So the Omar have an operation here.  How's the black market in Seattle?
8321/0:I think you got you money's worth.  Now stab out and keep your mouth shut.
8322/0:Unless Sid Black sent you to pay his debt -- or you want to bring me his head -- you better let one of my security guards escort you out.
8323/0:Sure you don't want to reconsider?  You could become a very powerful man, Alex.  With biomodification technology properly regulated, you would be the forerunner of a new elite.
8324/0:He owes Miss Sak some money.  We're keeping his jet until he pays up.  Last thing we need is some stranger casing the landing pad.
8325/0:No, but the man who interrupted Dr. Nassif mentioned a "Code Yellow" emergency.  Does this sort of thing happen a lot?
8326/0:It's true that SSC's performance so far has been less than adequate.
8327/0:There hasn't been commercial air travel since the Collapse.  Twenty years ago.
8328/0:Everybody just wants an easy life.  Who can argue with that?
8329/0:I wish Nicolette could have lived to see this day.  We used to say that if we couldn't have a family we would adopt.  The joke was that we were going to adopt the population of the entire planet.
8330/0:Won't Mako just hand the project to another scientist?
8331/0:And you think you can equalize human ability with biomods?
8332/0:You're talking about those freaks who get biomodded or turned into cyborgs, right?  Wish there was something we could do about them.
8333/0:I'm your assassin.  How do you want it -- fast or slow?
8334/0:Just calm down.  
8334/1:Back off!
8334/2:I don't think you really want to do that.
8335/0:Just calm down.  
8335/1:Back off!
8335/2:I don't think you really want to do that.
8336/0:Move along.
8336/1:Hey -- get outta here.
8336/2:You're not supposed to be here.
8337/0:Move along.
8337/1:Hey -- get outta here.
8337/2:You're not supposed to be here.
8338/0:Go bother someone else.
8338/1:I don't have time for this today.
8338/2:I'm running out of patience with you.
8339/0:Go bother someone else.
8339/1:I don't have time for this today.
8339/2:I'm running out of patience with you.
8340/0:Hey -- you trying to rip me off?
8340/1:Back off!
8340/2:You'd better watch where you're going, pal.
8340/3:Fine -- shove me around like a piece of furniture.  I'm used to it.
8340/4:Well, excuse you.
8340/5:Jeez.  I feel like part of a pinball machine.
8340/6:Hey -- you ran right into me on purpose, didn't you?
8341/0:Hey -- you trying to rip me off?
8341/1:Back off!
8341/2:You'd better watch where you're going, pal.
8342/0:Hey!  I'm not here for target practice, you idiot.
8342/1:I can return the favor, if you like.
8342/2:You're going to regret this, if you keep it up.
8343/0:Hey!  I'm not here for target practice, you idiot.
8343/1:I can return the favor, if you like.
8343/2:You're going to regret this, if you keep it up.
8344/0:Good work.  Chief Morgan will be pleased.
8345/0:I'm not sure what they do back here, but I'm supposed to make sure no one messes with it.
8346/0:All set.  Hop in and let's get out of here.
8347/0:Yes, my Seeker.  Her Holiness is with us.
8348/0:
8349/0:We appreciate your resourcefulness in seeking us out.
8350/0:I am still unable to land.  Perhaps the SSC guards in the flight bay know what happened to the pilot beacon.
8351/0:Finally.  Here's your pay.  Pleasure doing business with you.
8352/0:I already took care of her guards.  Maybe I should finish the job.
8353/0:An acceptable exchange.
8354/0:Looks like it was more than a standard infusion.  This IS Paul Denton we're talking about.  It appears they designed it as a new breed of nanite, one suitable for the entire human race.
8355/0:We were only following Luminon Saman's directives.  We had no idea it would come to this.
8356/0:
8357/0:I can't imagine why you let them pollute you like you did.
8358/0:Did you see where the murderer went?
8359/0:I just walked right into the enclave.  No one checked my ID or anything.
8360/0:I am not sure, but I think we are in real danger.
8361/0:Did you see where the murderer went?
8362/0:Unbelievable.  Who's responsible?
8363/0:Unbelievable.  Who's responsible?
8364/0:Anybody I know?  I spent a right many days in that town with Cindy and her mangy friends.
8365/0:Don't forget to blink.
8365/1:You trying to intimidate me with that glare?  It's not working.
8365/2:Take your staring contest somewhere else, freak.
8365/3:Make bug-eyes at someone else.
8365/4:Did I DO somethin'?  WHAT?
8365/5:What am I?  A movie star?  Find someone else to watch.
8366/0:Who killed that man?
8367/0:Don't forget to blink.
8367/1:You trying to intimidate me with that glare?  It's not working.
8367/2:Take your staring contest somewhere else, freak.
8368/0:Who killed that man?
8369/0:You gotta get off that zyme...
8369/1:You really don't want to start something with me.
8369/2:Find someone else to bother...NOW.
8369/3:You expect me to be impressed?
8369/4:Cut it out.  I'm serious.
8369/5:Think I'm just some random bystander who doesn't give a damn what you do?  Think again.
8370/0:Who killed that woman?
8371/0:You gotta get off that zyme...
8371/1:You really don't want to start something with me.
8371/2:Find someone else to bother...NOW.
8372/0:Who killed that woman?
8373/0:Calm down!
8373/1:I don't want any trouble!
8373/2:There's no need for that.
8374/0:Who's the knockout artist?
8375/0:Panzerwerks has tolerated the Order's ecoterrorism for a long time.
8376/0:Combining ancient herbal remedies with state-of-the-art nanopathology research, we have produced the first and only anti-plague-11 tonic, and infused it into this special cola drink, to make it a delicious way to fight the effects of the nanite cloud -- VitaTech Cure-11.
8377/0:Never a dull moment around here.
8378/0:Calm down!
8378/1:I don't want any trouble!
8378/2:There's no need for that.
8379/0:Who's the knockout artist?
8380/0:What's the matter?  Never learn to talk street?
8381/0:
8381/1:
8382/0:You shouldn't be here.
8382/1:Get lost.
8382/2:You're in a restricted area.  Move it.
8383/0:
8383/1:
8383/2:
8383/3:
8383/4:
8384/0:You shouldn't be here.
8384/1:Get lost.
8384/2:You're in a restricted area.  Move it.
8385/0:That's enough!
8385/1:You're gonna get yourself in trouble here.
8385/2:You really need to start thinking before you act.
8386/0:There are certain lines you shouldn't cross.  I hear the Omar recruit members by kidnapping HOMELESS people.  Turn down the wrong alley, and whack!  You're a robot.
8387/0:That's enough!
8387/1:You're gonna get yourself in trouble here.
8387/2:You really need to start thinking before you act.
8388/0:Here's a fair payment. [500 credits]
8389/0:Good for you.
8390/0:My parents are dead.  They were in Chicago at the time of the attack.
8391/0:May Her Holiness return soon.
8392/0:I've heard the name.  Not much more, though.
8393/0:I talked to Miss Withers.  She said that she already has her mind made up on a Pequod's endorsement.
8394/0:At least he's alive.  Know who did this?
8395/0:At least he's alive.  Know who did this?
8396/0:At least she's alive.  Know who did this?
8397/0:So?!  Russell understood that people are creatures of impulse.  The role of political philosophy should be to control the destructive impulses with constructive, creative ones -- for example, allow each citizen to direct his own growth.
8398/0:At least she's alive.  Know who did this?
8399/0:I'm at the end of my rope with you.
8399/1:One more time, and you're gonna be sorry.
8399/2:You cross this line and you're gonna pay.
8400/0:I'm tracking an armed troublemaker.  Can you give me a lead?
8401/0:I'm at the end of my rope with you.
8401/1:One more time, and you're gonna be sorry.
8401/2:You cross this line and you're gonna pay.
8402/0:I'm tracking an armed troublemaker.  Can you give me a lead?
8403/0:
8404/0:Phew!  You really had me going there.
8404/1:You really shouldn't mess with people like that.
8404/2:What a stunt!
8405/0:I'm after a thief.  What can you tell me?
8406/0:Phew!  You really had me going there.
8406/1:You really shouldn't mess with people like that.
8406/2:What a stunt!
8407/0:I'm after a thief.  What can you tell me?
8408/0:We aren't afraid of you!
8408/1:Come on!  Let's see you fight!
8409/0:This constant haze is awful. 
8410/0:We'll show YOU...
8411/0:It's not too late!  Just stop right now, and you won't bring that monster back into the world.
8412/0:I'll see if I can find someone who can help...
8413/0:
8414/0:I'll see if I can find someone who can help...
8415/0:I'm gone!
8415/1:I'm taking off.
8415/2:Better get the hell outta here.
8415/3:Oh, jeez, this is for real!
8415/4:Better keep my head down, I guess.
8415/5:Here we go again...  See ya later.
8416/0:I'm gone!
8416/1:I'm taking off.
8417/0:The lockdown's still in effect, so watch your step.
8418/0:The WTO is wrongly equated with blind commercialism, says Dumier, just as the Order is wrongly equated with fanaticism.
8419/0:Originally we'd planned for holding the summit here, the most secure location.  So much for that plan...
8420/0:Let me take a moment to praise the Seattle delegates who attended our conference on establishing a World Congress.  Every day brings us closer to transitioning from city-states to nationhood.  Soon, citizens, we will live in the first world-wide democracy.
8421/0:No, you've just got to consent to the standard deactivation procedure before entry: I'll transmit the encrypted safety-lock bytecode which will effectively freeze all your weapons.  Sensors at the exit will automatically reactivate everything you're carrying when you leave.
8422/0:At least YOU weren't here when they attacked.
8423/0:You're pleading for your life, and that's the best you can do -- a keypad code?
8424/0:No thanks.
8425/0:I'm glad to hear it.  Aren't you worried that the Templars might occupy the medina?
8426/0:I talked to the facility director and got the details on the mess.  I want to take a look at the extent of the damage.  I might take the clean-up contract.
8427/0:I'll ask Grandfather.
8428/0:You might turn something up over there.
8429/0:You might turn something up over there.
8430/0:The guy you want is over there.
8431/0:The guy you want is over there.
8432/0:Your followers must understand the need for dialogue.
8433/0:Huh?
8433/1:Eh?
8433/2:Oh?
8434/0:The lady you want is over there.
8435/0:Huh?
8435/1:Eh?
8435/2:Oh?
8436/0:The lady you want is over there.
8437/0:Huh?
8437/1:Eh?
8437/2:Oh?
8438/0:I caught a glimpse of something... I dunno.  Over there.
8439/0:I'm ready.
8440/0:Huh?
8440/1:Eh?
8440/2:Oh?
8441/0:I caught a glimpse of something... I dunno.  Over there.
8442/0:Huh?
8442/1:Eh?
8442/2:Oh?
8443/0:Check that way.  There was a ruckus just now.
8444/0:The new face of hate.  They call themselves the Knights Templar and claim to be descended from Hugues de Payns and the Temple of Solomon.
8445/0:Huh?
8445/1:Eh?
8445/2:Oh?
8446/0:Check that way.  There was a ruckus just now.
8447/0:Huh?
8447/1:Eh?
8447/2:Oh?
8448/0:Huh?
8448/1:Eh?
8448/2:Oh?
8449/0:Huh?
8449/1:Eh?
8449/2:Oh?
8450/0:Huh?
8450/1:Eh?
8450/2:Oh?
8451/0:How much?
8452/0:Like you -- look at you.  I bet you have been fed like a little bird since you were an infant -- petted, encouraged, juiced up biomedically... Yes, I know who I am looking at.
8453/0:HEY -- I'll ask the questions here.  You're thugs, and innocent people --
8454/0:Get the hell out of here.  No payout, no refund, you're lucky we don't sell your butt to the Omar to recoup damages.
8455/0:The going rate.  [500 credits.]
8456/0:But what about the apartment?
8457/0:I knew Chicken-liver was a serious player cuz of the chipped teeth.
8458/0:I didn't see anything.
8458/1:I wish I could help.
8459/0:I didn't see anything.
8459/1:I wish I could help.
8460/0:I guess they never invented a bot that cleans other bots.
8461/0:Hello there.
8461/1:Hi.
8462/0:Hello there.
8462/1:Hi.
8463/0:An excellent choice.
8464/0:Huh?
8464/1:Eh?
8464/2:Oh?
8465/0:Carry on, Mister.
8466/0:What can you tell me about this place?
8467/0:Huh?
8467/1:Eh?
8467/2:Oh?
8468/0:Carry on, Mister.
8469/0:Just trying to run an honest business where people can drink without worrying about getting shot at.
8470/0:Hello?
8470/1:Maybe something's up?
8471/0:Ma'am.
8472/0:Hello?
8472/1:Maybe something's up?
8473/0:Ma'am.
8474/0:Hello?
8474/1:Maybe something's up?
8475/0:Good seeing you.
8475/1:Yes.  Hello.
8476/0:First take care of the missile batteries.  They need to be disabled in order for me to get away safely.
8477/0:Hello?
8477/1:Maybe something's up?
8478/0:Good seeing you.
8478/1:Yes.  Hello.
8479/0:Alex D.  The information you provided our agent was incorrect.  The Omar trader in the medina has been assassinated.  Your future business with the Omar will proceed on much less favorable terms.
8480/0:Help me!
8481/0:Hello?
8481/1:Maybe something's up?
8482/0:Find the Aquinas specification, transmit it to my team in Munich, then neutralize JC Denton and step into his machine.  My scientists will modify your nanite architecture into a delivery vehicle for our cellular defense mechanism.
8483/0:Hello?
8483/1:Maybe something's up?
8484/0:Hello?
8484/1:Maybe something's up?
8485/0:You got a problem with how the first fight went down, talk to the bookie.  You can't win 'em all.
8486/0:Something like that.
8487/0:After all the equipment they wrecked and stole in the name of "preserving the natural Order," I do not understand why the WTO would agree to a summit with these freaks.
8488/0:A paycheck is a paycheck.  I don't care who I'm working for.
8489/0:My brother died from Played 11.  You wouldn't believe what that did to my father.
8490/0:Just happy to be able to make myself useful, earn an honest credit, heh heh.
8491/0:Thanks for the help.  I guess they weren't kidding about you Tarsus recruits.
8492/0:Venning!  I demand an answer about this problem with the fuel cells and the haptic receptors.  We've been in production for three months -- and now this??  You assured us you'd fully tested the design and had no problems.  Now we're going to lose two weeks fixing this mess.  I'm holding you personally accountable.  
8493/0:It has been a pleasure doing so much business with you.
8494/0:
8495/0:They're all good intentions...
8496/0:
8497/0:Carry on.
8498/0:Carry on.
8499/0:Officer.
8499/1:A glass beat from hell.
8499/2:Hey.
8499/3:My feet are killing me.
8500/0:Officer.
8500/1:A glass beat from hell.
8500/2:Hey.
8500/3:My feet are killing me.
8501/0:Officer.
8501/1:How's it goin'?
8501/2:Ran the beggars off, I guess.
8502/0:Officer.
8502/1:How's it goin'?
8502/2:Ran the beggars off, I guess.
8503/0:They keep messing with the schedule.
8503/1:I feel like I've been standing here all week.
8503/2:So many new sections of the penal code...
8503/3:All this big talk about terrorism, then they let whole cities of beggars grow up around the enclaves -- with only us standing between them!
8504/0:They keep messing with the schedule.
8504/1:I feel like I've been standing here all week.
8504/2:So many new sections of the penal code...
8504/3:All this big talk about terrorism, then they let whole cities of beggars grow up around the enclaves -- with only us standing between them!
8505/0:Yep.
8505/1:I say that all the time.
8505/2:Yeah -- it's startin' to burn me up, too.
8506/0:Yep.
8506/1:I say that all the time.
8506/2:Yeah -- it's startin' to burn me up, too.
8507/0:Here you go.
8508/0:What do you expect me to do?
8509/0:Go on now.   You have your orders.
8510/0:I'll see what I can do...
8511/0:I'll think about it.
8512/0:Is everyone in this joint out to kill Gob-zilla?
8513/0:Remember -- you are leasing from US.  You must grant the WTO entry for investigation of our own hangars.
8514/0:You got what you could out of her -- more than enough.  Hire a pilot at the Pequod's coffeeshop on Level 107.  You're going to find this Mr. Tong in Trier.
8515/0:By the way, we let Miss Sparks go.  Our people took her out of the arcology.  I'm glad that we can trust each other, Alex.
8516/0:Does the phrase Total Information Awareness mean anything to you?  Never mind.  Here's the money.
8517/0:
8518/0:I don't know how much more I can take.  My family here has been systematically murdered.
8519/0:Saw monsters dropping out of the attic in that alcove!
8520/0:Glad the director found someone to clean up the spill.
8521/0:I heard he got arrested because he was plotting against the students.
8522/0:At least we get paid on time.
8522/1:But the WTO -- at least they take care of their own.
8522/2:It's better than working for SSC, though.  Over there, you're just another gun for hire.
8522/3:But reviews are coming up.  We could always get promoted.
8523/0:I can't stand those transgenics.  I can make it worth your while if you take care of it for me.
8524/0:At least we get paid on time.
8524/1:But the WTO -- at least they take care of their own.
8524/2:It's better than working for SSC, though.  Over there, you're just another gun for hire.
8524/3:But reviews are coming up.  We could always get promoted.
8525/0:So they keep tellin' me.
8525/1:Whatever you say.
8525/2:Yeah, right.
8526/0:They really want us to find true balance and order in our lives, which can only be possible when we're not being subjected to secret experiments.  
8527/0:So they keep tellin' me.
8527/1:Whatever you say.
8527/2:Yeah, right.
8528/0:Hold that thought.  Could be an intruder.
8528/1:Wait.  Is someone listening in?
8529/0:Later, dude
8530/0:Hold that thought.  Could be an intruder.
8530/1:Wait.  Is someone listening in?
8531/0:Right.  Those are the orders.  Let Alex Denton pass.  Apparently on our side now.
8532/0:Step up and take your medicine.
8532/1:That all you got?
8532/2:I'm ready when you are.
8533/0:This area is protected.
8533/1:... gotta keep these beggars and thieves in their place...
8533/2:Section 511... resisting an officer of the law...
8534/0:Be patient.  We can't just rush in there.
8535/0:This beggar thinks he's some kind of terrorist.
8536/0:This beggar thinks she's some kind of terrorist.
8537/0:Very interesting.  There's also been a very large transfer of money from a bank in Germany.  Please tell me if you find out for certain what's happening in that facility.
8538/0:I'll take the prox mines. [300]
8539/0:Leave.  You're blowing my cover.
8540/0:You just made my job a lot easier.
8541/0:We deserve better treatment than this.
8542/0:
8543/0:So.  Alex.  You know that thing you've got in your head that lets people interrupt your thoughts from anywhere on the planet?
8544/0:Sure, make a run at the Statue.  [250]
8545/0:We will hold it this time.
8546/0:Guess I'll find my pilot and consider your request.
8547/0:The lesson of the Collapse is that we need to learn to live as human beings.
8548/0:Well, yes -- in a manner of speaking.  MJ-12 was a splinter of the Illuminati, so anything that hurt them benefitted the remaining families.  But I wasn't an Illuminatus at the time.
8549/0:
8549/1:
8549/2:
8549/3:
8549/4:
8549/5:
8549/6:
8549/7:
8550/0:I'll let you know if I learn anything.
8551/0:I didn't think you'd have the guts.
8552/0:Good luck.
8553/0:Just so you know, we've been trained for counterterrorism.
8553/1:You're outnumbered.
8554/0:How's the search coming?
8555/0:Watch me make him dance.
8555/1:We've got him.
8556/0:Watch me make her dance.
8556/1:We've got her.
8557/0:All right, Godzilla...
8558/0:Easy, big guy.
8559/0:Nice...  I guess the training paid off.
8559/1:Easy enough...
8560/0:Let's do this by the book...
8560/1:Guess you're not up to the task.
8561/0:Don't worry about me -- I'll be there when you need me.
8562/0:It's not over yet.
8562/1:Go in for the kill.
8563/0:Don't let up.  This one's dangerous.
8564/0:Finish him off.
8565/0:Intruder is armed and modified.  Approach with caution.
8566/0:Cleansing procedures complete.  Detox successful.
8567/0:WTO security would like to know the same thing.  They lack evidence for a search warrant.
8568/0:Splendid.  An opportunity for my new friend to meet the enemy.
8569/0:You shouldn't be calling me Karl.
8570/0:Today's forecast calls for a medium airborne nanite debris level.
8571/0:Meanwhile, we have been accused of theft, which is ridiculous.
8572/0:First message:
8573/0:This is the arcology's Outreach kiosk.  Any trouble, you can report it to me.
8574/0:Finish her off.
8575/0:New York, one way, no sweat.
8576/0:Die already!
8577/0:... put this thing out of its misery.
8578/0:(grunt)
8578/1:(grunt)
8578/2:(grunt)
8579/0:Get up!  You can make it!
8579/1:You'll pay for that!
8579/2:Now you went too far!
8580/0:Man down!
8581/0:I have a ballistic silencer, appropriate for any caliber barrel.  Also a black-market biomod canister, enables non-Piezochem functionality.  I've also got an SMG machine gun.  As a regular customer, you must pay full price for each.
8582/0:Woman down!
8583/0:The beggar's gonna pay for that!
8584/0:Wait -- I've got to snap out of it.
8585/0:Be careful!  He means business.
8586/0:Be careful!  She means business.
8587/0:Shhh!  The sound barrier's down.
8588/0:This has always been your destiny.  It is good that a Denton has finally accepted it.
8589/0:You fiend!  Without a test subject, my technicians can't verify our counter-nanite and will have to release it blind.  You may find yourself responsible for a plague like nothing the world has ever known.
8590/0:You'd think with a weapon like that there'd be some bonuses.
8591/0:
8592/0:Yes -- of course.  Here you are.  Find the Sequencing Module.  Go through the gateway to JC's sanctuary.  We have our own interest in protecting JC Denton from the Templars.
8593/0:Thank you for your bravery and kindness.  We are all in danger now.  Panzerwerks has erupted into a riot just as Her Holiness arrived in Trier to try to soothe tensions between our church members and the factory's workers.
8594/0:
8595/0:I can manage.
8596/0:He's pinned down in the Inclinator right now, negotiating with the authorities for safe passage out of Seattle.  I want you to infiltrate the facility and learn what you can about this betrayal.  Then perhaps we will be closer to understanding his actions at Tarsus Academy.  Speak with the Her Holiness presence in the chapel if you have any doubts about us.  Your data has been fed into the system.
8597/0:Have you met anyone else here besides Nassif?
8598/0:He killed him!
8599/0:He killed her!
8600/0:She killed him!
8601/0:They lied to me!
8602/0:She killed her!
8603/0:You'd better be ready.  After everything he's done to undermine the Grand Master's plans, he definitely wants this guy taken down.
8604/0:Don't let it eat him!
8605/0:Don't let it eat her!
8606/0:Yeah!  Follow through!
8606/1:One more like that!
8606/2:Again!
8607/0:That's right -- make him dance!
8608/0:That's right -- make her dance!
8609/0:That takes care of one missile battery.  Now disable the one at the other corner of the building.
8610/0:Hold on -- I can't carry anything else right now.
8611/0:Your kill.  You do the paperwork.
8611/1:That's how you do it.
8611/2:You did it!  All clear.
8612/0:Hey, I just want to join in the fun.
8613/0:Accusations of corruption are a serious matter, Alex.
8614/0:Ni-i-i-i-ce.... Appreciate the hospitality, flyboy.
8615/0:
8616/0:It's not like they have a warm and fuzzy image to uphold.  What are they hiding?
8617/0:I haven't seen you before. Welcome to our small medina.
8618/0:I think he heard ya.
8619/0:I think she heard ya.
8620/0:You're in the killzone!
8620/1:Take cover!
8620/2:Use your head!  Get outta there!
8621/0:He's on you!
8622/0:She's on you!
8623/0:The body must be dead, or we won't be certain of our enemy's fate.
8624/0:Don't leave me!
8624/1:Where are you going?
8624/2:Go!  Save yourself!
8625/0:I will be waiting.
8626/0:Keep clear -- grenade.
8626/1:Hey -- catch!
8627/0:At this point I'd take you up on it, too.
8628/0:Grenade!
8628/1:Hit the deck!
8629/0:I am watching from a spy satellite, Alex.  I am an Omar now.  It is good.  I saw one of the leaders go down.  They are weak and made of flesh.  Forget their schemes.  Wipe them all out and destroy the machine JC Denton built inside the Statue.
8630/0:Carry lab I.D. at all times.
8631/0:Must be a prox mine.
8632/0:Don't worry.  I have this area sewed up.
8633/0:Stand clear until it's neutralized.
8634/0:I hope you find what you are seeking.
8635/0:Her Holiness is dead!  This is a generated image.
8636/0:So much is at stake that a few sacrifices are more than acceptable.  We're talking about the survival of a pure human race.  Someday you will see that our cause is just.  For now, there's nothing you can do for these students.  It's too late.
8637/0:With the help of Agent Morgan, I learned that Luminon Saman is the traitor.  He has converted most of the Trier shard to his extremist views, incited the riots, and has been stealing equipment from the Panzerwerks factory.
8638/0:When they lose a cyborg, the Omar replace it with the person they blame for the death.  It's called forced assimilation.
8639/0:You're wasting time.  I want you to locate the Aquinas specification inside UNATCO.  When Helios has recovered its Hub privileges, you'll step into the infusion chamber, and the nanites in your body will be replicated in the air and ultimately in the bloodstreams of every last human being.
8640/0:
8641/0:I'll see what I can do.
8642/0:I don't have enough for the apartments' master code. [500]
8643/0:I found out quite a bit about the Tarsus experiments.
8644/0:The scabs outside Upper Seattle have their high-minded reasons for opposing the WTO, but it all comes down to envy.
8645/0:Damn it, Alex -- the WTO needs her alive for questioning!
8646/0:Easy -- I already took care of the Omar.  I was just messing with you.
8647/0:That was UNATCO headquarters, right?  United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition.  I know what I'm talking about.  I heard it was a front for the terrorists who made the Gray Death and brought about the Collapse.
8648/0:The WTO and Order are actually two branches of the same organization?
8649/0:You have your orders.
8650/0:That they hope to get from us.
8651/0:Good to hear that the envoy from Antarctica has arrived.  It hasn't been determined how much of a link any of them have with him while he's asleep like this, but it can't hurt to continue the research.
8652/0:I didn't come here looking for a fight.
8653/0:
8654/0:Tell me more about this "posthuman order."
8655/0:Safe at last.
8656/0:You always speak the truth, Your Holiness.
8657/0:I wanted you to see more evidence that the program is corrupt.  We weren't their proteges --  just their guinea pigs.  That's why I joined the Order.
8658/0:I'm doing okay, for now.  The Templars are right at our door, but at least they're giving us a breather.  I just hope the rescue flight gets here before the next volley starts.
8659/0:Only if preceded by an impure motivation.  However, since Saman's tactics were not working, Her Holiness came to Trier to try and reach some form of truce.  Now we have no idea where she is.
8660/0:D-zero-three.
8661/0:What do you mean?
8662/0:They can be defeated.  We just have to have faith, Alex.
8663/0:I overheard the assassins talking.  Yes -- they plan to kill your entire family.  You better stay put until they're gone.
8664/0:I think we can take this all the way, Alex.
8665/0:Well, hurry the hell up.  This is the World Championship about to go down.
8666/0:Pequod's.  Coffee for your kind of world.
8667/0:
8668/0:I'm glad I could help.
8669/0:Mmm, what do I see?  An exceptional young man.  Modified, correct?  Lovingly grown in an enclave -- and now you step into the dangerous world.  Stay ready, Tarik.
8670/0:Good thing we kept the Templars from getting to her first.
8671/0:
8672/0:
8673/0:(wild laugh)  Thanks for the creds, old bean.  Think I'm gonna rag it over to Times Square to see Erin.  For what it's worth, here's a map of the island.  I figure you aren't leavin' that island, so why should I gamble my bird?  Right?  (laugh)  Over -- and -- out, scally...
8674/0:Helios has regained its Hub privileges.  Step into the infusion chamber, and the nanites in your body will be replicated in the air and ultimately in the bloodstreams of every last human being.
8675/0:I heard that the Omar put out a contract on him.
8676/0:Yes!  I'm playing RIGHT NOW.
8677/0:We want peace.  No more death.
8678/0:The rumors about Tarsus have been greatly exaggerated.
8679/0:Check it out -- scab, twelve o'clock.
8680/0:
8681/0:So you're serious -- leaving all your work at Tarsus behind so you can join this church.  How do you know we can trust THEM?  They attacked the apartments and put us in danger.
8682/0:(scream)
8682/1:(scream)
8683/0:Hope you got your money's worth, cuz I'm keeping your winnings, supposing you have some.  House rules.  Try to make a clean bet next time.
8684/0:(groan) I can't see!
8685/0:You'll have to try harder than that.
8685/1:Was that supposed to hurt?
8686/0:Heh.  So many people come to Upper Seattle with high hopes.  When I got my work-pass I thought that this job was just the first step to becoming an enclave citizen.  That was eight years ago.  They pay me too little to ever get out of this job.
8687/0:(groan)
8687/1:(cry)
8688/0:(groan) I did what I could...
8689/0:Uh!
8690/0:Calling themselves the Templars, heirs to the ancient sacred brotherhood, they now vow to protect Purity in the present day from biomodification, which they believe pollutes and degrades the human genome. 
8691/0:(gasp)
8692/0:Your actions in Antarctica prove you're honorable -- you let me go and didn't shoot me in the back.  I've realized that we've known each other too long to let others order us to assassinate each other.  I'm supposed to keep this area secure, and I intend to take down anyone else who comes by, but you're free to go, Alex.
8693/0:Sweet.
8693/1:Excellent.
8693/2:Get the idea?
8694/0:Mr. Dumier said that I would be most useful in the medina, comforting our concerned believers.  Perhaps there is an operation planned against the arcology, but I did not inquire.  I trust him to take appropriate action.
8695/0:I know how to shoot, you know.
8695/1:All that target-practice paid off.
8696/0:Saw ya flinch.
8696/1:Oooo!
8697/0:It can be difficult to see that from the outside.
8698/0:Alex -- how can murder these scientists so brutally?  They're defenseless!  And they only wanted to help you achieve your potential.  I know you must be angry, but killing them accomplishes nothing.
8699/0:Fine.  Get out of here.  But tell your boss I need some weapons, and I need them now.
8700/0:Wish I could help.
8701/0:You could tell me what a Code Yellow emergency is.  When I was talking to Dr. Nassif, a man interrupted to tell her that a security guard had been killed.
8702/0:Ah, youth... so refreshingly idealistic.
8703/0:I guess it depends.  Is there a connection?  I mean -- between the Tarsus experiments and the initial biomod research?
8704/0:My little girl... my poor little girl...
8705/0:People accuse the WTO of creating monopolies.  In my opinion, the real danger is from the cyborgs.
8706/0:And those were your last words.
8707/0:Wrapped that up nicely...
8707/1:Well, that's that.
8707/2:Oooo, messy.
8708/0:I've got a lot of grading to do.
8709/0:A real shame.
8709/1:Didn't have to be this way...
8710/0:Really, Mom, I'll be fine.
8711/0:Nuts!
8711/1:Almost...
8711/2:Oops!  Messed up...
8712/0:In a manner of speaking.
8713/0:I got a little hasty there...
8713/1:Gotta keep steady...
8714/0:Mr. O'Rourke is expecting you.  Come right in.  I will unlock the door.
8715/0:Well!  Aren't you in a fix?
8715/1:I know what you're thinking.  Go on, do it.
8715/2:I'm meaner than I look.
8716/0:The woman from Seattle -- yes.  She's in the upstairs office, reviewing our logs for the Order.  Where are you from?  New Cairo?  Why come here?  The air in the medina is polluted.
8717/0:Watch your step around here.  The locals mean business.
8718/0:Who'da thought politics could turn us into mortal enemies?
8718/1:So sorry they messed with your head; a real loss.
8719/0:Talk to Sales.  I just built the thing.  Don't ask me why we want to arm a bunch of bigots.  Genetic purists, ha!
8720/0:Let's make this quick.
8720/1:Impressive stamina.
8721/0:Why won't you leave me alone?
8722/0:You're just another screwball renegade, Alex.
8723/0:I don't trust Sak, but I guess I'll do my job as long as I'm here.
8724/0:(grunt)
8724/1:(grunt)
8724/2:(grunt)
8725/0:Anyone there?
8725/1:What's that?
8725/2:Eh?
8726/0:Unlocking your sabr can also help you achieve greater Order.  As the Muslims before you who revered this attribute, you must be steadfast and you must be patient.  Sometimes the Search will be difficult.  Obstacles within yourself and people who do not understand may stand in your way.  Self-discipline and faith will keep you on the path.
8727/0:Look out!  It's live!
8728/0:Anyone there?
8728/1:What's that?
8728/2:Eh?
8729/0:Strange...
8729/1:Bah, now what?
8729/2:Am I getting jumpy, or is something really going on?
8730/0:Strange...
8730/1:Bah, now what?
8730/2:Am I getting jumpy, or is something really going on?
8731/0:Strange noises...  
8731/1:I think I heard something.  
8732/0:In the next rev, you'll be able to drive one of these suits remotely.
8733/0:Strange noises...  
8733/1:I think I heard something.  
8734/0:I'm looking for the Order church.
8735/0:They say she writes all of her own material.  Right -- her and a team of about a hundred composers in a WTO enclave somewhere.
8736/0:Our work has always done more good than harm.  The Collapse would have been far more devastating if Chad and I hadn't served the memory of my mother and of my family's history by rebuilding the Illuminati organization, which was nearly destroyed by MJ-12.
8737/0:Stick to the dance floor, okay?
8738/0:The truth...?
8739/0:Why aren't you at the Statue with JC?
8740/0:You know this for certain?  I should stay in position -- how long?
8741/0:We don't want you falling into the wrong hands.  You better go.
8742/0:My, my the flesh seems almost human....  You might feel a little stick.
8743/0:Tryin' a grenade...
8744/0:The Order and WTO have maintained a fragile peace over the last two decades as they've pursued parallel strategies for rebuilding global government after the Collapse.
8745/0:
8746/0:Looks like a prox mine...
8747/0:
8748/0:Impressive -- but remember that I'm augmented, too.
8748/1:They gave me the same bag of tricks they gave you.
8749/0:I'm listening.
8750/0:Never know where you'll end up...
8750/1:Just have to stay on top of it...
8750/2:Guess it'll work out.
8750/3:Wonder what they're thinking.
8750/4:... yeah, that'll impress them...
8751/0:(humming)
8751/1:(yawn)
8751/2:(grrr)
8751/3:(cough)
8751/4:(clears throat)
8752/0:Are my eyes just playing tricks on me?  
8752/1:I think I saw something.
8753/0:Real cute.
8753/1:Is there a problem?
8754/0:Are my eyes just playing tricks on me? 
8754/1:I think I saw something.
8755/0:Oooo!
8755/1:Watch where you're stepping.
8755/2:Really!
8756/0:Perhaps we're not alone here...
8757/0:Please.  I'm a private person.
8757/1:What manners.
8757/2:Go stare at someone else.
8758/0:Perhaps we're not alone here...
8759/0:You look like you're up to no good.
8759/1:I don't think you're supposed to be doing that.
8759/2:Some nerve!
8760/0:More of the same?
8760/1:I'm really beginning to wonder what's going on here.
8761/0:Sorry.  Off-limits.
8762/0:More of the same?
8762/1:I'm really beginning to wonder what's going on here.
8763/0:What -- is someone there?
8763/1:Hello? //more insistently
8764/0:It's about time you quit being an assassin for a bunch of pseudoreligious mystics.  Locate Dr. Nassif and interrogate her.  The WTO wants to get to her before she reveals anything valuable to the Templar terrorists.  We think she may be holed up behind what remains of the ApostleCorp security system.
8765/0:What -- is someone there?
8765/1:Hello? //more insistently
8766/0:Who's there?
8766/1:What is this nonsense...
8766/2:Somebody lookin' to die?
8766/3:Who's that?  It's not mealtime, is it?
8766/4:Don't make this a bad situation.
8767/0:Who's there?
8767/1:What is this nonsense...
8768/0:The faithless are easy to manipulate politically, and remember, the faithless are the majority.  We should not forget de Tocqueville's insight.  If a man does not submit to faith, he will desire a firm, tyrranical shape for society.
8769/0:Hi.  I'm NG Resonance.  What would you like to talk about?
8770/0:
8771/0:As you wish.  JC will make his case when we reach Liberty Island, but expect to prove yourself before he will trust you again. 
8772/0:We also suspect that there are a few bots gone haywire inside.  
8773/0:
8774/0:
8775/0:You are on the verge of fulfilling the promise of the Denton experiment.
8776/0:
8777/0:Sid Black.  Why are you still hanging around Cairo?  You do know that the medina could get overrun by Templars at any moment...?
8778/0:Seekers closing in and our own security system turned against us -- we're trapped!
8779/0:Oh my!  You startled me.
8779/1:You should probably put that away.
8779/2:That's not a toy.
8780/0:Real smart.
8780/1:Watch it.
8781/0:Really, that's enough.
8781/1:What's your deal?
8781/2:I'm sure...
8782/0:You're weirding me out.
8782/1:Wipe that grin off your face.
8782/2:What is it?  WHAT?
8783/0:If you want to avoid confrontations in the hall, you could crawl through a vent shaft I found earlier.  It connects Klara's and Leo's apartments.  Enter the apartment on your immediate left to get to it.
8784/0:Number 22, Heron's Loft, right?
8785/0:You psycho.
8785/1:Well, I never...
8785/2:That's a violation of civil law, you know.
8786/0:What do you think this is now?
8786/1:Is someone paying us a visit?
8787/0:You really must leave.
8787/1:I'm supposed to turn people away.
8788/0:What do you think this is now?
8788/1:Is someone paying us a visit?
8789/0:Jeez!
8790/0:You can't sneak up on me!
8790/1:Just go ahead and try something.  I'm ready for you...  
8791/0:I'm tired of you ignoring my wishes.
8791/1:You better not make me mad.
8791/2:I won't stand for this!
8792/0:You can't sneak up on me!
8792/1:Just go ahead and try something.  I'm ready for you...  
8793/0:Last warning.
8793/1:I've just about had it!
8793/2:You're making a big, big mistake.
8793/3:Try me.
8794/0:Stand ready.
8794/1:There we go, now.
8795/0:Huh.  Smug arcology brat...
8796/0:I hope I don't miss my connection.
8797/0:No more of that.  Okay?
8797/1:Let's try to put that behind us.
8798/0:Stand ready.
8798/1:There we go, now.
8799/0:You must have no idea who you're messing with.
8799/1:Be assured: I will find you.
8799/2:Whoever you are, you've made a bad mistake!
8799/3:Don't need any back up for this.
8799/4:Oh man.  You're taking on the TEMPLARS?
8799/5:Locked and loaded.  Come and get it.
8799/6:Let's see some action!
8800/0:My God!
8800/1:Jesus!
8801/0:Figures.  They get the all-clear and forget all about me.
8802/0:Think I saw something...
8802/1:Hm.  Looked like a person, maybe.
8803/0:Excuse me.  Hey, you.
8803/1:An intruder!
8804/0:Some of those stories about the Order have got to be propaganda.
8805/0:I do not know who the Templars are, but their name was in these documents and video mails.
8806/0:Not that I know of, but Dr. Nassif did give me a strange reply when I mentioned the Dentons.
8807/0:Why so hostile?  I'm not evil.  I merely oppose the powers that have shaped and confined you up until now.  Just allow my scientist, Dr. Todd, to scan your cell nuclei -- and leave Paul alone.
8808/0:The Plan has been completed.
8809/0:Hold on.  I'm too loaded down right now.
8810/0:Something wrong?
8811/0:Just visiting Upper Seattle.
8812/0:We have to get out of here.
8813/0:Just wait!
8813/1:Not now!
8814/0:Why, hello!
8814/1:Well!  How are you?
8815/0:Hi there.
8815/1:Well, hello!
8816/0:There!
8817/0:No problem.
8818/0:Sorry.  Wish I could help.
8819/0:We will prepare the way.  We will lead and protect humankind.
8820/0:I've been thinking about this.  I don't want to be a lab monkey or be in anybody's army.  I don't want to be a piece of meat they fight over.  Corporate heavy, maybe.  But right now I work for myself.
8821/0:Here's something to give you an edge -- a biomod infusion.  It isn't much, but it's all I managed to grab on my way out of the laboratory.
8822/0:Hey, yo, get serious, y'all.  P's comin' any second.  Supposed to get busted out an hour ago.
8823/0:
8824/0:So I'm barred from entry?
8825/0:The rest of your questions will be answered in due time.
8826/0:I was unable to locate Cairo International Airport.  This small landing pad was the closest I could come to the city center.
8827/0:What troubles you?
8827/1:This doesn't look good.
8827/2:I should prepare myself.
8827/3:Fear not.
8828/0:Lovely.  I need to get out of town, too.  Get in.
8829/0:What troubles you?
8829/1:This doesn't look good.
8829/2:I should prepare myself.
8829/3:Fear not.
8830/0:I heard that he wound up dead.
8831/0:I wasn't so hot at the stealth maneuvers.  You go ahead.  I'll try to stay out of the way.
8832/0:
8833/0:They allow too much Inclinator traffic with Lower Seattle.  That's how these things happen.
8834/0:I'm so glad Her Holiness was rescued.  Now the Summit can get back on track.
8835/0:They must have commanders, though.  Soon they'll see that their kind won't be tolerated.
8836/0:I escaped.  You may be interested to know that I found another person who appears to be modified in the way that you were.  Leo Jankowski.  I gave him a ride to Cairo.
8837/0:Get too stringent about this sort of thing, and you end up with an unfriendly business enviironment.
8838/0:This'll be twenty-three in a row.  Put your money on 'Zilla, buy yourself a villa.
8839/0:Not interested, honey.
8840/0:But the Trier delivery is already a week behind schedule...
8841/0:Do you have any idea what might be going on with the missing students?
8842/0:The Order contacted me in Chicago and told me how to uncover Tarsus's treachery -- we're not trainees, we're test subjects.  Finding out I've been used like that, I don't feel so bad about disobeying orders.
8843/0:That is your prerogative.
8844/0:Sorry.
8845/0:Are you crazy?  You rode the Inclinator through the spill.
8846/0:Just a minute.  I'm not quite ready.
8847/0:AI emplacements are required by the WTO Charter to act on incriminating evidence.  Since you are a stranger, I can tell you freely that there are rumors about corrupt arcology officials.  If you learn anything, I can record your testimony and disburse an appropriate reward.
8848/0:Well, she's dead.  Happy now?
8849/0:Just melt away and re-group.  That's war in the post-territorial world.
8850/0:What's the lawyer say the club member did?
8851/0:I wonder if they roughed him up before they took him away.  I kinda hope so...
8852/0:In the bull's eye today -- Luminon Saman, formerly of the Order Church.  So you've gone public with a NEW con-game, I hear.  What's it called...?  Uh --
8853/0:As you wish.
8854/0:Right, like I'm about to sign up with a guy who wants to mod people by force.  If you ask me, I think you're dealing with crazies on all sides.  Knights Templar?  Do they really think they're knights or what?  Illuminati?  Who told you they were in the Illuminati?
8855/0:Name's Sid Black.  Harrier pilot.  Best flyer you ever laid eyes on.  I heard there might be a war about to happen around here.  Need a lift to safety?
8856/0:You could say that....
8857/0:Great changes are coming.  The right-thinking will be avenged.
8858/0:Your for real, huh...?  Meet me outside after closing.
8859/0:The Order wanted to stop the experiment.  That's about all I know.
8860/0:I would expect as much, considering the hostile business climate.  Anyone get hurt earlier tonight during the bombing or whatever it was?
8861/0:We're having a private conversation.
8862/0:We ask that all regular customers please respect to the privacy of the clubhouse.
8863/0:I'm listening.
8864/0:I ran into this commando by the landing pad.
8865/0:
8866/0:Sorry, I'm on duty.
8867/0:Why would the Templars bother with capture?  I hate to be so blunt, but it seems that elimination would make more sense.
8868/0:This is the Emerald Suites, friend, home to Upper Seattle's elite.  The Culture Minister himself leases the penthouse.  There's a research scientist in 2224 -- she's hardly ever home -- and a high-end lawyer in 2226.
8869/0:Time for you to run along, fanboy.
8870/0:Resourceful little muckraker, aren't you?  How much do you want?
8871/0:Be still and let Her Holiness into your heart.
8872/0:I'm bouncing around in here like a sack of potatoes.
8873/0:
8874/0:I managed all right.
8875/0:I -- I'm sure SSC will be sending help, any minute now...
8876/0:I have a black-market biomod canister, which enables non-Piezochem functionality.  I am also selling three energy cells for powering your biomodified systems.  Or you might want two EMP grenades, for disrupting electronic devices, such as surveillance equipment.  As a regular customer, you must pay full price for each.
8877/0:
8878/0:There's a Seeker down there...  I guess I gotta take him down.
8879/0:I enjoyed our chat.
8880/0:I can't wait to get home.  I'm gonna go straight to the Greasel Pit and enjoy myself for a change.
8881/0:We've been with the program since we were thirteen years old.  Why are you so quick to abandon that?  What can the Order offer you?
8882/0:I don't have the credits for the scrambler grenades. [600]
8883/0:You'll be able to breathe as freely out here as the New Cairo citizens do in their arcology.
8884/0:Excellent.  My technicians on Ophelia are already configuring the first operational Aquinas Hub in a generation... one which is in orbit and safe from tampering.  Now make sure that JC Denton is dead.
8885/0:I'm almost afraid to leave my house.  Those horrible pictures from Chicago -- did you see them?  And our own security breakdown here in Seattle with Tarsus and the Inclinator.
8886/0:I'll take the multitools. [400]
8887/0:Don't play any of your games with me.  I know how to take care of myself.
8888/0:Tell you what, I'll give you the sloshed-flyer special.  Any local hops you need during the next twenty-four hours, just fifty percent more than my usual rate.  You can't beat that.  [750 credits.]
8889/0:Not disparity, but difference, and the well-managed specialization it makes possible.  Some people just aren't leaders and shouldn't be granted great powers.  The Illuminati want to ensure that humankind will always have a select few -- like you, Alex -- to inspire the rest.
8890/0:So we wait.  While some greedy bald scientist ignores the plague to make pills for dieting, we wait.  Like stones in the desert, we are dead, waiting for nothing.
8891/0:Huh?
8891/1:Eh?
8891/2:Oh?
8892/0:You have your orders.
8893/0:This is a great place for people-watching.  I'm gathering material.
8894/0:I'm glad I could help.
8895/0:It's time for you to redeem yourself.
8896/0:I heard that the summit has been delayed.
8897/0:
8898/0:I can't pay that much for the ammo clip. [200]
8899/0:
8900/0:I'm just getting warmed up.
8901/0:
8902/0:This school was once an ApostleCorp operation.  The Knights Templar must have penetrated their organization some time ago.  An interesting discovery, but one of secondary concern now that we already know the location of the secret ApostleCorp facility.
8903/0:I'm just getting warmed up.
8904/0:Jason!
8905/0:I'm safe... for now.
8906/0:I'm just getting warmed up.
8907/0:I'm just getting warmed up.
8908/0:The next one will find it's mark.
8909/0:The next one will find it's mark.
8910/0:The next one will find it's mark.
8911/0:Huh.
8912/0:The next one will find it's mark.
8913/0:The next one will find its mark.
8914/0:The next one will find it's mark.
8915/0:Now I can settle up with the Omar.  They're my biggest client.
8916/0:Thank Heaven for the Church.
8917/0:I thought the students were being evacuated.
8918/0:I'm fine....  I should've listened to you in Germany and left the WTO while I had the chance.
8919/0:I don't want your money, just an explanation.
8920/0:I will be waiting for you to change your mind.
8921/0:The more devout Seekers want a strict interpretation of the scriptures, which I guess were written around the time of the Collapse.
8922/0:I just wanted to let you know that the man at the bar, Seattle's Minister of Culture, would like to invite you to his penthouse to talk about your sculptures.
8923/0:It's already taken care of.  Pequod's image is going to get a facelift.
8924/0:You aren't cleared to enter the landing bay, Alex.  Get out of there.  My people are in the middle of a very important investigation.
8925/0:SSC couldn't find a riot prod in a Horde lab.  
8926/0:We've got work to do.
8927/0:The next one will find it's mark.
8928/0:The next one will find it's mark.
8929/0:The next one will find it's mark.
8930/0:Fine by me.  I got my own situation in Trier, anyway.
8931/0:The next one will find it's mark.
8932/0:The next one will find it's mark.
8933/0:The next one will find it's mark.
8934/0:(grunt)
8934/1:(grunt)
8934/2:(grunt)
8935/0:Not that I want to see anyone get hurt, but I'd pay to see someone break in and set fire to their inventory of coffee beans.
8936/0:(grunt)
8936/1:(grunt)
8936/2:(grunt)
8937/0:Dr. Vlimek, my commanders were quite pleased with the last data sets you've sent us.  We did, however, have some questions about the retrofitting on some of the sensors.  Let's schedule a time to meet about this.
8938/0:(grunt)
8938/1:(grunt)
8938/2:(grunt)
8939/0:The Order reprogrammed our security system.  We're stuck here unless we can get past the beam-trigger. 
8940/0:(grunt)
8940/1:(grunt)
8940/2:(grunt)
8941/0:I've taken care of the problem.  The area is no longer hazardous.
8942/0:Ready when you are.
8943/0:Wait too long, and one of these greedy bastards might slip off the island.
8944/0:Does the phrase Total Information Awareness mean anything to you?  Never mind.  Here's some money for your trouble.  The cyborg was my primary competition in the enclave.  Now -- don't you think we can be friends?
8945/0:I'm gonna scream...
8946/0:I'll take my chances.
8947/0:An underground lab, on the outskirts of Trier...
8948/0:I guess you're one of the buyers.  You look like you're from a pretty hardcore outfit.  Must be a lot of undercover work.
8949/0:Doing business in the enclave is always interesting.
8950/0:Too bad for the Claw.
8951/0:The terrorists seem to belong to the Order -- religious fanatics.  Their exact objective is unclear.  All trainees will evacuate the facility immediately.  Use the elevator in my office.
8952/0:No sign of trouble so far.
8953/0:That's not what he told ME.
8954/0:Don't WTO policies discourage price fluctuations?
8955/0:
8956/0:(grunt)
8956/1:(grunt)
8956/2:(grunt)
8957/0:No thanks.
8958/0:(grunt)

8960/1:(grunt)
8960/2:(grunt)
8961/0:The average citizen in a society of billions is never free, whether because of tyranny or simply because of the contrast between his small size and the size of the government.
8962/0:This is no drill.  The facility is under attack.  Alex, please get the medkit and multitools from your equipment locker next to the basketball court -- just a precaution.  I'm transmitting the softkey ID to your datavault right now....  More details when they become available.
8963/0:Rescuing one of us is invaluable in helping our kind to survive.
8964/0:(grunt)
8964/1:(grunt)
8964/2:(grunt)
8965/0:So you gave the order to destroy my home town...
8966/0:(grunt)

8969/0:2226 is some slimey lawyer.
8970/0:I can't get a clear shot.
8970/1:I lost the target
8971/0:
8972/0:I can't get a clear shot.
8972/1:I lost the target
8973/0:Fellow WTO citizens, look about you at the splendor of the WTO enclaves. You enjoy a higher standard of living than anyone else in  the world.  Know this, such prosperity is not a product of corruption, and I am injured by the accusations against my office in Cairo.
8974/0:I don't have the people in Seattle to stop you, I suppose.  Disobey the WTO again, however, and you will regret it.
8975/0:We've got our guards in place and every eventuality planned for.  My troops are ready for anything.
8976/0:Sure, take out Dumier's commandos on the dock.  [500]
8977/0:As survivors flee the remains of the city, they wonder how or why this disaster could have happened.
8978/0:My bird sunk to the bottom.  Luckily, though, I'm in good shape.  I swam over a mile to get to shore.
8979/0:
8979/1:
8979/2:
8979/3:
8979/4:
8980/0:You talk like you knew JC personally.  Did you know him before the merger?
8981/0:
8981/1:
8981/2:
8982/0:My problem was that I never had any conviction.  I always needed someone to encourage me.
8983/0:
8984/0:No loitering.
8985/0:The guard was dead.  I'm sure of it.
8986/0:I suggest you report this to the media.  Force the parent company to come clean.
8987/0:
8988/0:
8989/0:
8990/0:I can't get a clear shot.
8990/1:I lost the target
8991/0:I can't get a clear shot.
8991/1:I lost the target
8992/0:Can't complain, I guess.  When I work the slums I get hazard pay.
8993/0:I cannot get a clear shot.
8993/1:I lost the target
8994/0:We certainly don't have a more determined enemy than Luminon Saman.
8995/0:I can't get a clear shot.
8995/1:I lost the target
8996/0:Uh...  Anyway... You're right...  I'm not a Templar.  Do you have any idea why they've got you caged up here?
8997/0:
8998/0:I can't get a clear shot.
8998/1:I lost the target
8999/0:This is the Emerald Suites, friend, home to Upper Seattle's elite.  The Culture Minister himself leases the penthouse.  There's a research scientist in 2224 -- she's hardly ever home -- and a high-end lawyer in 2226.
9000/0:I can't get a clear shot.
9000/1:I lost the target
9001/0:Alex, no luck finding an exit.  Why are we locked in?  And why aren't the other trainees asking questions?  Maybe they're in on it... whatever IT is.  I don't like this, Alex.  They whisk us out of bed, bring us here in the middle of the night, and... Hold on.  I hear someone.  Come see me as soon as you get this.
9002/0:I can't get a clear shot.
9002/1:I lost the target
9003/0:I can't get a clear shot.
9003/1:I lost the target
9004/0:Hazard cleared.
9005/0:I can't get a clear shot.
9005/1:I lost the target
9006/0:I can't get a clear shot.
9006/1:I lost the target
9007/0:You're on your own now.
9008/0:Loosen up, Karl.  We're doing SCIENCE here.  Remember when you'd get drunk and start quoting Freeman Dyson?  I know you're on my side.  Pre-Collapse science was all about toys for the rich over necessities for the poor.  Haven't we gotten past that?
9009/0:The WTO made the offer to hold talks in response to anti-WTO rioting in the Trier Panzerwerks factory.
9010/0:Sorry, I don't work there.  You said it's a factory?  In the canal?  What else do you know about it?
9011/0:This has been today's 'WTO Did You Know?'  Check back tomorrow for more fascinating facts.
9012/0:
9013/0:I can't let you do that.  I'm going to take you down, but I'll try to leave you breathing.  I don't want to kill you, Billie.
9014/0:What do you have?
9015/0:Ha-hah!  We did it!  Snake-eyes BURIED that fool greasel!
9016/0:I hope it doesn't come to that, but, yes, I am tired of paying for their crimes.  Every time they mess with the plant, it comes out of my paycheck.
9017/0:Ready for an extraction, scally.  Just send word with the pilot beacon by Flight Bay 23.
9018/0:Look at the sky!  The Swell's gone!
9019/0:
9020/0:The WTO does some admirable work, but couldn't it lead to the same kind of overcentralization that made the world so vulnerable to the Collapse in the first place?
9021/0:A failed corporation named VersaLife.  The Omar have learned much from the VersaLife laboratories abandoned after the Collapse.  Shall we conduct business?
9022/0:Oh God...  He's really dead, isn't he?
9023/0:Coward!
9023/1:Come back here!
9024/0:Coward!
9024/1:Come back here!
9025/0:Coward!
9025/1:Come back here!
9026/0:Sounds like a good way to become a target.
9027/0:Coward!
9027/1:Come back here!
9028/0:Great, that was our only lead.  Go back and see if you can find any other clues the Omar might have left behind.  I understand your frustration though -- I don't want to waste my time saving the world until we figure out where Dr. Nassif is hiding.
9029/0:Coward!
9029/1:Come back here!
9030/0:Aquinas waits for your direction.
9031/0:Coward!
9031/1:Come back here!
9032/0:Coward!
9032/1:Come back here!
9033/0:Heard you went rogue.
9034/0:We're trying to create a new peace, where everyone has access to goods that they need, and has a mutual interest in keeping commerce flowing.
9035/0:Coward!
9035/1:Come back here!
9036/0:I cannot watch over you anymore because I am needed elsewhere.  Here is a map of the island.  Good luck, Alex.
9037/0:Coward!
9037/1:Come back here!
9038/0:Coward!
9038/1:Come back here!
9039/0:I know your niece.  She was my instructor at Tarsus Academy in Seattle.  I'm not here to kill anyone.
9040/0:So after the Collapse JC went underground to....  what?  Start his own biomod firm?  From what I know, he doesn't seem like the corporate type.
9041/0:You're one of my favorite fans, Alex.  I'm ready to listen any time you have something on your mind.
9042/0:
9043/0:What's the situation right now?
9044/0:I guess I'm not the only one.  Are you still a prisoner of the WTO in Seattle?
9045/0:In the next rev, you'll be able to drive one of these suits remotely.
9046/0:Local hops.  All you want for a day.  [750 credits.]
9047/0:I guess someone put you on our trail.  It didn't take them long to get to you, did it?
9048/0:That's Shutterbug under the floor.  Raised her from a little pup.
9049/0:You can't blame him for trying, I guess.
9050/0:The WTO is handling the situation now.  We've got bots patrolling, which I can't reprogram at this stage.  There's no way we can guarantee anyone's safety under these conditions.
9051/0:Don't worry, I'll figure out how to get to New York.  I want to see what that's all about.
9052/0:Coward!
9052/1:Come back here!
9053/0:Oh, and by the way, it has come to my attention that you rooted out some corruption in the New Cairo arcology.  Well done.  It's my pleasure to present you with the Citizen's Bonus in person.
9054/0:I can't pay that much for the ammo clip. [400]
9055/0:I am nervous enough about my grades.  And you will get me in trouble with the teacher.
9056/0:Coward!
9056/1:Come back here!
9057/0:See ya later.
9058/0:Ha!  You missed!
9059/0:Ha!  You missed!
9060/0:Saman really is a Templar?
9061/0:Ha!  You missed!
9062/0:Ha!  You missed!
9063/0:Ha!  You missed!
9064/0:Really?  I haven't heard any shooting.  Are you sure it wasn't an accident?
9065/0:Ha!  You missed!
9066/0:Ha!  You missed!
9067/0:I could come right out and tell you, but how much fun would that be?
9068/0:Ha!  You missed!
9069/0:It's your assignment.  Figure it out.
9070/0:I never had any doubts you'd join us in the end.
9071/0:You will have to ask Mr. Tong.  Shall we go?
9072/0:You're just one man.  It's not wise to start a war before you know your enemy.
9073/0:Ability.  Ability is the ideal that drives the modern state.  It's a synonym for one's worth, one's social reach, one's "election," in the Biblical sense, and it's the ideal that needs to be changed if people are to begin living as equals.
9074/0:Go outside to the abandoned VersaLife base.  You will need to turn on the pilot beacon so that I can land safely.
9075/0:Don't worry about me -- I can take care of myself.
9076/0:Each person's true potential will be able to shine through now, no longer burdened by physical limitations.
9077/0:Hello?
9077/1:Maybe something's up?
9078/0:Leo Jankowski?  I went to school with that guy -- briefly.
9079/0:Hello?
9079/1:Maybe something's up?
9080/0:Hello?
9080/1:Maybe something's up?
9081/0:Hello?
9081/1:Maybe something's up?
9082/0:Ha!  You missed!
9083/0:There it is again.
9083/1:I wonder what that's about.
9084/0:Convergence is possible, my seekers.  The Chairman and I have outlined a program to bring our systems into agreement.  Poverty is not a prerequisite for fulfillment, nor is amorality a prerequisite for prosperity.  Together, in peace.  This is the way.
9085/0:Ha!  You missed!
9086/0:There it is again.
9086/1:I wonder what that's about.
9087/0:Just watch what you're doing now.
9088/0:Ha!  You missed!
9089/0:There it is again.
9089/1:I wonder what that's about.
9090/0:I was once an investment banker in the arcology, but now I teach yoga here in the medina.
9091/0:Well, I don't want to end up workin' for some feeb in a vat of salt water.
9092/0:Ha!  You missed!
9093/0:There it is again.
9093/1:I wonder what that's about.
9094/0:
9095/0:Looking good, looking good...
9096/0:I wonder what that is about.
9096/1:There it is again.
9097/0:Looking good, looking good...
9098/0:There it is again.
9098/1:I wonder what that's about.
9099/0:Looking good, looking good...
9100/0:If the WTO and Order aren't actually opposing entities, then what's the point of this summit?
9101/0:Looking good, looking good...
9102/0:If I go down fighting bigots, I guess that's not so bad.
9103/0:Looking good, looking good...
9104/0:Looking good, looking good...
9105/0:I have no enemies, merely topographies of ignorance.  The people drift aimlessly, collecting into clans wherever they find a glimmer of knowledge...
9106/0:
9107/0:A toxic spill shut down the inclinator system early this morning. 
9108/0:So what've you been up to, Alex?  Globe-hopping for one of the post-Collapse quasi-governments?
9109/0:So let's see what's for sale...
9110/0:Tarsus has extensive security.
9111/0:Sorry, Chicago, I'm gonna have to take you out.
9112/0:There it is again.
9112/1:I wonder what that's about.
9113/0:There it is again.
9113/1:I wonder what that's about.
9114/0:There it is again.
9114/1:I wonder what that's about.
9115/0:We're going to need some extra cover for the shipment next week.  
9116/0:There it is again.
9116/1:I wonder what that's about.
9117/0:Looking good, looking good...
9118/0:There it is again.
9118/1:I wonder what that's about.
9119/0:Looking good, looking good...
9120/0:There it is again.
9120/1:I wonder what that's about.
9121/0:Looking good, looking good...
9122/0:I think something's going on here.
9122/1:That's a bit unusual.
9123/0:Looking good, looking good...
9124/0:I think something's going on here.
9124/1:That's a bit unusual.
9125/0:Looking good, looking good...
9126/0:I think something's going on here.
9126/1:That's a bit unusual.
9127/0:Looking good, looking good...
9128/0:I think something's going on here.
9128/1:That's a bit unusual.
9129/0:
9130/0:Looks like an even match here.
9131/0:Looks like an even match here.
9132/0:Something just wasn't right about the people who worked here.
9133/0:Yeah, he told me where to find you.
9134/0:Looks like an even match here.
9135/0:Looks like an even match here.
9136/0:What's going on?
9136/1:Uh-oh...
9136/2:That means trouble.
9136/3:What are you running from?
9137/0:Whoa -- Hey!  This is my apartment.
9138/0:I'll leave for Cairo as soon as I can.
9139/0:This one can help deal with the intruders.
9140/0:It's a shame.
9141/0:I have an arcology pass.  I'll let you know if I hear anything.
9142/0:Hey -- how did you get in here?
9143/0:What are you doing here?
9144/0:It takes someone with a pretty serious God complex to start their own religion.
9145/0:If I was a Templar assassin, I wouldn't stand around talking about it.
9146/0:That is a bit unusual.
9146/1:I think something is going on here.
9147/0:I think something's going on here.
9147/1:That's a bit unusual.
9148/0:I think something's going on here.
9148/1:That's a bit unusual.
9149/0:It must be pretty risky for the Omar to operate in the heart of Upper Seattle.
9150/0:I think something's going on here.
9150/1:That's a bit unusual.
9151/0:Against terrorism, espionage, rioting, and plain old theft, WE protect YOU.
9152/0:Looks like an even match here.
9153/0:I think something's going on here.
9153/1:That's a bit unusual.
9154/0:Looks like an even match here.
9155/0:I think something's going on here.
9155/1:That's a bit unusual.
9156/0:Looks like an even match here.
9157/0:I think something's going on here.
9157/1:That's a bit unusual.
9158/0:Looks like an even match here.
9159/0:I think something's going on here.
9159/1:That's a bit unusual.
9160/0:Looks like an even match here.
9161/0:Well, now I'm paying attention...
9161/1:That's definitely not right.
9162/0:Looks like an even match here.
9163/0:Well, now I'm paying attention...
9163/1:That's definitely not right.
9164/0:Looks like an even match here.
9165/0:Looks like an even match here.
9166/0:This is hopeless!
9167/0:This is hopeless!
9168/0:Templar bigotry is merely a bastard creed -- it has nothing to do with the search for true order.
9169/0:I'm just glad I didn't have a reaction to whatever the Tarsus people were shooting into our veins, and now I've got a security assignment.  That's all I ever wanted from that place.
9170/0:Get out of here!
9171/0:So you're Mr. Kurczec.  I've heard of your partner, Mr. O'Rourke, in Seattle.
9172/0:At least we're safe now.
9173/0:Preparing internally for the battle.  Diagnostics...complete.
9174/0:We'll be on our toes now, when dealing with the Templars.
9175/0:Queequeg's Coffee.  True to the letter means it tastes even better.
9176/0:The Templars STAND for something, you know?  It's ancient, it's philosophy, and it scrip's the paps off all that Her Holiness love an' meditate an' mumble to yourself.
9177/0:Business in a WTO area involves a much brainier class of felon.
9178/0:JC will make tomorrow look like yesterday now.
9179/0:I wish the media would stop playing those stories over and over.
9180/0:Well, now I'm paying attention...
9180/1:That's definitely not right.
9181/0:Well, now I'm paying attention...
9181/1:That's definitely not right.
9182/0:Alex D.  A welcome encounter.
9183/0:When I find out who authorized this transport in the first place....
9184/0:Well, now I'm paying attention...
9184/1:That's definitely not right.
9185/0:Well, now I'm paying attention...
9185/1:That's definitely not right.
9186/0:This is hopeless!
9187/0:Well, now I'm paying attention...
9187/1:That's definitely not right.
9188/0:This is hopeless!
9189/0:Well, now I'm paying attention...
9189/1:That's definitely not right.
9190/0:A conspiracy to disguise tyranny with so-called "free" institutions.  You're on your own, Mr. Dumier.  I'll hire a pilot at the local tavern and handle the Templar compound myself.
9191/0:I've seen the evidence myself.  He's working for those Purity crusaders -- the Templars.  Looks like you got yourself to safety just in time.
9192/0:This is hopeless!
9193/0:Well, now I'm paying attention...
9193/1:That's definitely not right.
9194/0:This is hopeless!
9195/0:Well, now I'm paying attention...
9195/1:That's definitely not right.
9196/0:This is hopeless!
9197/0:Well, now I'm paying attention...
9197/1:That's definitely not right.
9198/0:This is hopeless!
9199/0:Well, now I'm paying attention...
9199/1:That's definitely not right.
9200/0:This is hopeless!
9201/0:This is hopeless!
9202/0:I'd rather have it now, while you're still in business.  Aren't you worried that the Templars will occupy the medina?
9203/0:This is hopeless!
9204/0:You must be a new tenant.  I don't recognize you.
9205/0:This is hopeless!
9206/0:Me?  I just want Creation back.  God's Creation.  The birds, the squirrels... Not some Order hokum about mental states.  Not Feudal Knights slaying lizards in the sewers.  I want the EARTH back.
9207/0:A Trier business owner was murdered today.  He was the manager of the local QueeQueg's coffeehop.  It is unknown whether he is the victim of another labor dispute or an unrelated crime.
9208/0:I understand.
9209/0:Most are skeptics, to be sure, but with official sanction we can finally start to make some progress.  Children will grow up seeing us as prominent members of WTO-enclave management.
9210/0:
9211/0:You deaf?
9212/0:Tarsus -- oh, well, we don't know anything about the trials.  Don't tell me there's been an escape.  I warned Dr. Nassif.  I said that if she wasn't careful they'd end up with a JC Denton on their hands.
9213/0:Alex, it's so good to see you come to your senses and join our cause.  I knew you wouldn't fall for the lies of ApostleCorp or the Illuminati.  Purity is the only way to save humanity from ruin.
9214/0:Still, one less Omar is definitely a victory as far as I'm concerned.
9215/0:You bet.
9216/0:That freak Denton probably doesn't even see it coming.
9217/0:Your parents!  Oh, that's terrible.  I'm so sorry.  If I can do anything to make you feel more at home, let me know.
9218/0:Not for divebombing.  I've got to cover the cost of ammo.
9219/0:What's going on?!
9219/1:Gonna to put a stop to this.
9220/0:What's going on?!
9220/1:Gonna to put a stop to this.
9221/0:What's going on?!
9221/1:Gonna to put a stop to this.
9222/0:What's going on?!
9222/1:Gonna to put a stop to this.
9223/0:I already got into the main complex -- but thanks for the offer.
9224/0:What's going on?!
9224/1:I am going to put a stop to this!
9225/0:What's going on?!
9225/1:Gonna to put a stop to this.
9226/0:If you're lying, I'll find out soon enough.
9227/0:What's going on?!
9227/1:Gonna to put a stop to this.
9228/0:What's going on?!
9228/1:Gonna to put a stop to this.
9229/0:I'll think about it.
9230/0:What's going on?!
9230/1:Gonna to put a stop to this.
9231/0:What's going on?!
9231/1:Gonna to put a stop to this.
9232/0:I'm in the middle of working on my lesson plans right now.
9233/0:(laugh)  Nice.
9234/0:I track all of my fans to help route concert announcements, which reminds me -- you left New Cairo without seeing me perform!
9235/0:I hear NG Resonance is coming to the arcology.  You might get to see her if you hang around the flight bays.
9236/0:Are you certain?  A threat to Purity like this must not be tolerated.  We must identify new targets...
9237/0:I'm calling security!
9238/0:You don't look like you're from around here.
9239/0:How did you survive the raid?
9240/0:We're sick of you arcology types coming out here, pointing and laughing, like this is a theme park or a zoo.
9241/0:
9242/0:Alex, the visitation room is just down the hall from where you saw me talking to the Luminon.  I'll see you there.
9243/0:
9244/0:What was that noise?
9245/0:Not a theory -- fact.  Fact -- Inclinator traffic is half what it was two years ago.  Fact -- people this side of the Inclinator can't even get Metro passes anymore.  It's a complete WTO takeover, just like I predicted five years ago.
9246/0:Nothing you can give me will help Paul now.  I've joined the Templar cause.  I let them draw my blood and transport him away.
9247/0:It always helps to know who you are working for.
9248/0:Take care, Alex.  The Program will endure as long as one of you survives.
9249/0:Luminon Saman will lead us.  He's a man of action, not ruled by fear, and he refuses to bow to the WTO.
9250/0:That was a pretty low trick you played on the world, taking advantage of the Collapse to seize power and then deceiving people with a phony conflict between business and idealism.
9251/0:What's going on?!
9251/1:Gonna to put a stop to this.
9252/0:Nothing to see here.  Move along.
9253/0:I wanted to be close to the action.
9254/0:What's going on?!
9254/1:Gonna to put a stop to this.
9255/0:So you're fully engineered transgenics, not aliens.  That was just a cover story for a Cold War research project.  But there aren't very many of you -- hardly an army.
9256/0:I'm going to take care of this.
9256/1:This has got to stop.
9257/0:I'm going to take care of this.
9257/1:This has got to stop.
9258/0:Take my advice and call the whole thing off.  Encourage them, and you just make the Church into a bigger problem.  Mark my words... Afraid that's all the time we have.  A pleasure as always.
9259/0:I'm going to take care of this.
9259/1:This has got to stop.
9260/0:I'm going to take care of this.
9260/1:This has got to stop.
9261/0:I'm going to take care of this.
9261/1:This has got to stop.
9262/0:I'm going to take care of this.
9262/1:This has got to stop.
9263/0:Take my blood.
9264/0:I'm going to take care of this.
9264/1:This has got to stop.
9265/0:You deaf?
9266/0:
9267/0:I'm going to take care of this.
9267/1:This has got to stop.
9268/0:Then it will be time for you to do your part, Alex.  Everything depends upon you.
9269/0:Daddy says the SSC couldn't fight their way out of a medina playground.
9270/0:Ooo, that's not pretty.
9271/0:Pleasure's mine.  I never leave a bird in the woods.  But that's a wrap.  Even Sid Black needs rest.
9272/0:I'm in trouble!
9272/1:Get over here!  Quick!
9272/2:It's heating up over here!
9273/0:I'm going to take care of this.
9273/1:This has got to stop.
9274/0:I know you've been working for the Order and that they may have reasons to want Dr. Nassif dead.  I'm part of the WTO now and we don't believe in vigilantism.  I plan to enforce the law, no matter who threatens Nassif. We need her alive AND conscious for quick information extraction.
9275/0:I'm going to take care of this.
9275/1:This has got to stop.
9276/0:I can't believe my mother agreed to that...
9277/0:I'm going to take care of this.
9277/1:This has got to stop.
9278/0:All clear.
9278/1:No problem here.
9279/0:I'm going to take care of this.
9279/1:This has got to stop.
9280/0:Sir?
9281/0:Hey!
9281/1:Gah!
9282/0:Ma'am?
9283/0:Tarsus Tracking Report 4117 -- Alex D.  There are concerns that D. may be the greatest threat among his peers.  Last seen in Cairo, eliminating Leila Nassif for the Order.   Intel suggests that he now has objectives in Trier.  This makes it imperative that we get our agent through the gate immediately and shut it down.
9284/0:Hey!
9284/1:Gah!
9285/0:Hey!
9285/1:Gah!
9286/0:Hey!
9286/1:Gah!
9287/0:Gah!
9287/1:Hey!
9288/0:Hey!
9288/1:Gah!
9289/0:Excellent work.  I'll relay your report to headquarters.
9290/0:Thanks...
9291/0:Perhaps you're right.  May She forgive my doubt.  I grew up in post-Collapse Hong Kong.  My parents were Max Chen and Maggie Chow, conspirators involved wirh MJ-12.  My worst fear is that I'll give my allegiance to a deceptive cause.  May Order prevail.
9292/0:Yes.  The manager was murdered, but the Pequod's corporation will find a way to keep a branch in Cairo.  That is my fate.
9293/0:I've had enough of Seattle for a while, especially with all the commotion today.
9294/0:It's illegal to move biohazards with the Inclinator's cargo hold.  Must've thought they could bend the rules.
9295/0:Just wait.  Templars gonna have their day.
9296/0:Any luck?
9297/0:The information he's collecting seems suspicious.  I do not think that it's legal for him to be sending that outside the school, either.
9298/0:That's right -- your old instructor's family has been developing illicit strains of crops without any regard for WTO regulations.  Destroy the hydroponics -- and maybe pick up a hint regarding Dr. Nassif's whereabouts in the process.

9300/1:Right.
9300/2:Done.
9300/3:No sweat.
9301/0:(groan) ... my feet.
9301/1:All clear, I guess.
9301/2:... always talkin' to myself...
9302/0:(whistle)
9302/1:(hum)
9302/2:(yawn)
9302/3:(sniff)
9302/4:(clear throat)
9303/0:Hey!
9303/1:Gah!
9304/0:(grunt) What's the idea?
9304/1:(grunt) Cut it out!
9305/0:Hey!
9305/1:Gah!
9306/0:Hey!
9306/1:Are you blind?  Jesus.
9307/0:I don't have that kind of cash.  [750]
9308/0:I'll let you know how it goes.
9309/0:Hey!
9309/1:Gah!
9310/0:Back off, buddy.
9311/0:Hey!
9311/1:Gah!
9312/0:Back off, lady.
9313/0:Have anything else for me?
9314/0:Hey!
9314/1:Gah!
9315/0:Move along.
9315/1:Uh... hi.
9315/2:Go about your business.
9316/0:Hey!
9316/1:Gah!
9317/0:Nice one.  // sarcastic
9317/1:Stop horsing around.
9318/0:Looks it's gone, whatever it was.
9318/1:Nothing to worry about now.
9319/0:Looks it's gone, whatever it was.
9319/1:Nothing to worry about now.
9320/0:Looks it's gone, whatever it was.
9320/1:Nothing to worry about now.
9321/0:Looks it's gone, whatever it was.
9321/1:Nothing to worry about now.
9322/0:Very well.  You may use the English pilot.  I will depart for Liberty Island at once.  I will be needed once the Great Advance is complete.
9323/0:I'm just here to talk to Chief Morgan.
9324/0:Get out!
9325/0:The rumors about Tarsus have been greatly exaggerated.
9326/0:Then you're cleared to pass.
9327/0:I don't need a Mag Rail to complete my mission, which is to assassinate its creator.
9328/0:People are edgy because a few students are missing.  I'm not all that worried because I know Jennifer's too smart to let anything really terrible happen.
9329/0:I can't believe you turned against us like this.
9330/0:For all you know, I'm a Templar myself.
9331/0:There is still more work to be done.
9332/0:Extraordinary times, my young friend.
9333/0:And you buy it?  You think Paul and JC are sincere?
9334/0:This is WTO Security Chief Donna Morgan.  I thought you were told to report to the air terminal.  Very well.  Stroll around the Galleria, but be forewarned.  Terrorists reprogrammed the security systems to attack Upper Seattle residents and might still be in the area.  Some shoppers are pinned down in there, too.
9335/0:You must have orders from Dr. Nassif.  You should probably get going.
9336/0:So the Omar have an operation here.  How's the black market in Seattle?
9337/0:Can I help you, sir?
9338/0:Ma'am?  Can I help you?
9339/0:This area is restricted.
9339/1:Section 898... trespassing... That means move it!
9340/0:I'm shakin' in my boots, beggar.
9340/1:You wouldn't dare.
9341/0:Nothing to worry about now.
9341/1:Looks like it is gone, whatever it was.
9342/0:Oh -- tough guy...
9343/0:Is that illegal?
9344/0:Looks it's gone, whatever it was.
9344/1:Nothing to worry about now.
9345/0:Oh -- tough girl...
9346/0:Looks it's gone, whatever it was.
9346/1:Nothing to worry about now.
9347/0:That's enough of that!
9347/1:I'm not going to stand for this.
9348/0:Looks it's gone, whatever it was.
9348/1:Nothing to worry about now.
9349/0:You're messin' up my uniform.
9349/1:You've got a lot of nerve, punk.
9350/0:Looks it's gone, whatever it was.
9350/1:Nothing to worry about now.
9351/0:Quit looking at me.
9351/1:Wipe that look off your face.
9352/0:Looks it's gone, whatever it was.
9352/1:Nothing to worry about now.
9353/0:What?  You gonna ask me out or something?  Pwww.
9354/0:Take my blood.
9355/0:Looks it's gone, whatever it was.
9355/1:Nothing to worry about now.
9356/0:Looks it's gone, whatever it was.
9356/1:Nothing to worry about now.
9357/0:Something must be after it.
9358/0:Something must be after it.
9359/0:
9360/0:Toward your passenger?
9361/0:I have two black-market biomod canisters which enable non-Piezochem functionality.  Also:  three concussion prox mines, which you can plant on any flat surface to be detonated by movement within close range.  As a regular customer, you must pay full price.
9362/0:So you want me to disarm in the middle of a warzone?
9363/0:Stay sharp, Chicago.
9364/0:Wrong way.  Flight Bay 24 -- we must strike soon.
9365/0:Are you going to pay loverboy's fine or what?
9366/0:I'll stay airborne until you're ready to be picked up.
9367/0:How?  The facility's being locked down and evacuated.
9368/0:My friend here just hasn't been exposed to good coffee.  It won't take long to change her mind.
9369/0:I don't know what you think you're doing...
9369/1:That's completely out of line.
9369/2:Isn't that against the law?
9370/0:Tough luck, D.  The Pit appreciates the business, though.
9371/0:Get out of here.  Now!
9371/1:You've seen enough.  Now leave.
9372/0:A Trier business owner was murdered today.  He was the manager of the local QueeQueg's coffeehop.  It is unknown whether he is the victim of another labor dispute or an unrelated crime.
9373/0:Go ahead.  They'll lock you away for life.
9373/1:Calm down.  I want you to put that away.
9374/0:I'm a pretty quick draw, big shot.
9375/0:Something must be after it.
9376/0:I'm a pretty quick draw, lady.
9377/0:Hop in, scally.
9378/0:Our condolences to the families and friends of all those lost in the Chicago incident.
9379/0:
9380/0:Something must be after it.
9381/0:I'm not warning you again.
9381/1:(haughty) I'm an officer of the WTO.
9382/0:Something must be after it.
9383/0:Wiseguy.
9384/0:Something must be after it.
9385/0:Jesus, lady.
9386/0:Something must be after it.
9387/0:Don't make me draw my weapon.
9387/1:I am authorized to use force.
9387/2:Try that one more time...
9388/0:Something must be after it.
9389/0:You gave me a good scare back there.
9389/1:No more funny business.
9390/0:If that nanoformer was up, we'd be fine.  
9391/0:Something must be after it.
9392/0:Something must be after it.
9393/0:As if school isn't already stressful enough.
9394/0:Something must be after it.
9395/0:Something must be after it.
9396/0:I do not think SSC is really qualified to deal with a situation like this. 
9397/0:I figured you'd knock around Europe for a while.  You do know that the medina could get overrun by Templars at any moment...?
9398/0:I guess you could say that.  What about you, have you been with the organization long?
9399/0:Only a few steps remain before the new tomorrow.
9400/0:There have been no indications yet what their next move may be.  Experts anticipate drastic measures, based on what we've learned so far.
9401/0:You deaf?
9402/0:We never stole from you.  We only employed the necessary tactics to stop you from harming the natural Order.
9403/0:Funny.  These Knights Templar hate the idea of machines in your body to fight disease, but they don't mind having machines fight their wars.
9404/0:You an NG Resonance fan?  We just downloaded the NG chat construct on the kiosk by the stairs.  You should check it out.
9405/0:Red alert -- There has been a severe security breach.
9406/0:Not now!
9406/1:I don't have time!
9406/2:Let me take care of this first.
9407/0:Seek a higher path -- seek Order.  Join us for worship at the Hartford Turbine factory in Lower Seattle.  All are welcome.
9408/0:It won't open!
9409/0:Bet'chu thought I was gonna rip you off, huh?
9410/0:How'd this get here?
9410/1:There's no way through!
9411/0:Are you kidding?  Without a haz mat suit?
9412/0:(grunt)
9412/1:(grunt) Here I come!
9413/0:I'm not goin' THAT way...
9413/1:Wouldn't be safe, I don't think.
9414/0:I'll get backup.
9414/1:... going to find reinforcements.
9415/0:Backing up!
9415/1:Run!
9415/2:Aaaaa!
9416/0:When JC arrived so many years ago, and the Versalife base fell silent, he took care of us.  In return, we would maintain his habitat while he slept, and await Apostlecorp's masterpiece.  Paul was to accompany the key, but instead two keys have arrived, and Paul remains nowhere.
9417/0:Talk.
9418/0:I'm looking for an armed suspect on the run.  Notice anything unusual?
9418/1:Some beggar just assaulted an officer.  Can you help me out?
9419/0:Chicago.  Someone put you on my tail?  You're a long way from home.
9420/0:I know a chopper pilot who might be available.
9421/0:
9422/0:Are you kidding?  This is a top-secret lab.  Those are gold beams -- they're set up to flatline a person in about a quarter second.
9423/0:Not everyone is ready to begin their Search.
9424/0:When will they learn?  The human organism should not be tampered with.
9425/0:Please.  I'm SSC.  We're responsible for security during the summit.
9426/0:Mr. Dumier sent me to safeguard Miss DuClare's return.
9427/0:We were friends.  Now he's... gone.  This is crazy.
9428/0:The black market biomod sounds like a deal.  I'll take it. [1000]
9429/0:Scan complete.  You biomods are quite new, but we offer technology you cannot find in Piezochem's labs.
9430/0:
9430/1:
9430/2:
9431/0:We're tracking an armed suspect.  See anything?
9432/0:What can you tell me?
9433/0:I've been specially posted to the Headmaster's office.
9434/0:I thought I saw someone snooping around.  Notice anything?
9434/1:I'm trying to find a prowler.
9435/0:I had no idea there was so much stress involved in working for a coffeehouse.  I should've guessed it -- the money was too good.
9436/0:Your presence is no longer required.
9437/0:I'm looking for a man I saw snooping around.
9438/0:I'm looking for a woman I saw snooping around.
9439/0:Is something going on?
9439/1:I don't like this.  Notice anything?
9440/0:I track all of my fans to help route concert announcements, which reminds me -- you left New Cairo without seeing me perform!
9441/0:Christ, look at that!
9442/0:Am I the only one who's seeing things?
9443/0:How stupid do you think I am?
9444/0:Am I the only one who's hearing things?
9445/0:All I know is I've never seen weather like THIS before.
9446/0:Know what just crossed in front of the light?
9447/0:No....!  NO!  The Illuminati are damaging the Helios core!  Satisfied, Alex?  I'm mortal like you again.  Helios won't be able to save me this time, but I don't plan to be the one who needs saving.
9448/0:Hello there.  Alex, from the Tarsus Program, right?  I wish you hadn't botched the Dr. Nassif interrogation in Cairo.
9449/0:At least you can hide from paladins.  The nanite swell was everywhere.
9450/0:AI emplacements are required by the WTO Charter to act on incriminating evidence.  Since you are a stranger, I can tell you freely that there are rumors about corrupt arcology officials.  If you learn anything, I can record your testimony and disburse an appropriate reward.
9451/0:What do you propose instead?
9452/0:Look how dark it is, Ani.  The breathers only work up to twelve million ppl.
9453/0:
9454/0:Can't carry anything else right now.  Hold on.
9455/0:Thank you again for all your help.
9456/0:The Order Church is in big trouble if they've given in to the radicals.
9457/0:Who put that there?
9458/0:Who caused the damage?
9459/0:Who destroyed it?  Do you know?
9459/1:I'm gonna write this one up: possible terrorist activity.  Notice anything?
9460/0:I've got things under control in the immediate area.  But thanks for the offer.
9461/0:I'd like to know why that's acting up.  Any ideas?
9462/0:I put my money on sabotage.  You?
9463/0:Who threw that?
9464/0:We might have a thief on our hands.  What do you think?
9465/0:And...?
9466/0:See who turned that on?
9467/0:See who turned that off?
9468/0:Who opened that?
9469/0:We aren't some self-help outfit like the Order Church.
9470/0:You can probably take care of JC Denton's machine on your own.
9471/0:It wasn't always called Club Vox.  It's been just about everything under the sun.
9472/0:Yes?  Let me hear that again.
9472/1:A noise.
9473/0:Holy -- what's that?
9474/0:(grunt) You WILL be brought to justice.
9474/1:(grunt) Give yourself up!
9475/0:I wasn't born yesterday...
9475/1:Nice try...
9476/0:Blood.  Well, well.
9477/0:I think we both know what we're talking about.  I'm a representative of the Omar black market.  I can arrange a meeting if you wish.
9478/0:That looked like a shadow.
9479/0:Something happened here...
9479/1:Hm, signs of fighting.
9480/0:As promised, I'm passing along what we can find out about Chicago.  Yes, ground zero was very near our facility.  But it seems a little paranoid to think a rival organization would blow up a whole city to disrupt Tarsus recruitment. Our best move is simply to keep this disaster in mind -- to resolve ourselves to remain independent and watch what we say about our operation to others.
9481/0:Who's lighting fires?
9482/0:How much to keep you quiet?  That's what this is about, right?
9483/0:Something must be burning.
9484/0:Just a minute.
9485/0:I'm glad to see that you've accepted the Order's assignments.  It looks like your next stop is Mako, north of town.
9486/0:See who closed it?
9487/0:It was for utilities.  Then the canal dried up and you could get in from outside.  One of these times, I'm going to set a fire!  (exultant laugh)
9488/0:Hey, wasn't that door closed?
9489/0:Hey, wasn't that door open?
9490/0:There used to be a door here, right?
9491/0:I think it's a done deal.  Sorry.  I probably shouldn't say any more since the papers haven't been signed.
9492/0:Why's that light on?
9493/0:Why's that light off?
9494/0:That's not an acceptable excuse.  However....  (sigh)  Well, I'm afraid we're stuck with each other.  I still need you to find the Sequencing Module and then go through the gateway to JC's sanctuary.  I have my own interest in seeing him revived.  Here is that map I mentioned.
9495/0:You have nothing to worry about now.  The headmaster won't be a problem anymore.
9496/0:Did someone scare them?
9496/1:What spooked 'em?
9497/0:See what caused the fire?
9498/0:Where's that smoke coming from?
9499/0:Blood....  Interesting.  See who's responsible?
9500/0:You better move.  This is the real thing.
9501/0:Welcome to Club Vox.
9502/0:Just curious.  The Pequod's in my hometown was always packed.
9503/0:
9504/0:D for Upper Seattle Dandy?
9505/0:
9506/0:Someone took down a transgenic.
9507/0:I don't mind bending the rules in order to save her life.
9508/0:
9509/0:A disturbance...
9510/0:
9511/0:I'd like to find the vandal who did this.
9512/0:Someone's going to do twelve to eighteen months for destruction of private property.
9512/1:Hm.  Completely destroyed.
9513/0:Clearly a malfunction...
9514/0:Is that so?  We must be of like minds.  That'll buy me a month or two until the Omar sneak another one into town.  Here, take the money, a token of my appreciation.
9515/0:Nickel and dime, nickel and dime...
9516/0:Strange... it looks disabled.
9517/0:They'll be watching to see how we handle ourselves.
9518/0:Was that on?
9519/0:Was that turned off?
9520/0:Did someone turn the light on?
9521/0:Did someone turn the light off?
9522/0:Hm.  I'll think about it.
9523/0:I saw one of your troopers killed.  And now there's this yellow alert...  Do you know what's going on?  
9524/0:Go now.  I have preparations to make.
9525/0:You should leave.
9526/0:That's right, you arrived and you're still there.  I saw you myself -- the real NG Resonance.  Trust me, you're not in any shape for a concert.
9527/0:I know how to take care of a killer.  Just point the way.
9528/0:Unbelievable.  Who's responsible?
9529/0:Soon every human will return to what he or she was meant to be.
9530/0:Must've gotten sick.  Probably some rich guy, expects to be cured by "future technology."
9531/0:Who killed that man?
9532/0:Who killed that woman?
9533/0:I can't afford the new price.  [250 credits]
9534/0:Someone's trying the silent approach.  Any leads?
9535/0:Who knocked this man out?
9536/0:Who knocked this woman out?
9537/0:I'm tracking an armed assailant.  Can you give me a lead?
9538/0:Some beggar's gotten greedy.  Know where I can find the wretch?
9539/0:The price on those prox mines is too steep for me. [600]
9540/0:Don't hang around too long or else I'll motivate you myself.
9541/0:The Order believes in natural balance and they see Tarsus's operations as a violation of that.  It's impossible to live a balanced life if your actions are secretly manipulated by a lab with its own agenda.  Now you have the chance to see the real Tarsus -- Explore the facility, starting with your apartment.
9542/0:Who's the foxy lady?
9543/0:Don't worry about me.  I didn't just come back from the dead to get killed hours before the big event.  Join us at the Statue.  As MJ-12 used us, we've used you, but the commodification of ability is about to end.
9544/0:Someone must've opened it...
9545/0:Someone must've closed it...
9546/0:Unconscious.... Someone has a light touch.
9547/0:Hm, dead.  Well.
9548/0:(sigh)  Dead.  Someone's going to pay for that.
9549/0:I'm not falling for that trick.
9549/1:Trying to hit someone with that?
9550/0:Not here.  Strange.
9551/0:That wasn't there...
9552/0:Hm...
9552/1:Wonder what that was.
9553/0:Hey, back off.
9554/0:Maybe check over there.
9554/1:Not sure, but I bet the trail leads that way.
9555/0:Just another conspiracy theory.  Does anyone have proof?
9556/0:This town'll be talkin' about Gob-zilla for decades.  She's set every record in the book.
9557/0:I think there's a man over there.
9558/0:I think there's a woman over there.
9559/0:I think I saw something over there.
9560/0:I heard something going on over there.
9561/0:He attacked me!  Quick!  That way!
9562/0:She attacked me!  Quick!  That way!
9563/0:Beats me.
9563/1:Sorry, nothing to report.
9563/2:I've been trying to figure that out myself.
9564/0:Hello there.
9564/1:Hi.
9565/0:Carry on, Mister.
9566/0:You're a touch more irreverent than your brother, JC.  I like that.  Yes, you would be compensated.
9567/0:The Omar do not take such actions lightly.  Had you aided us in the past, all alliances would now be nullified, but no such connection exists.
9568/0:
9569/0:Can't be a coincidence...
9569/1:Funny.  Thought it was my imagination before.
9570/0:No luck.
9570/1:Nothing.  Oh well.
9570/2:The snake ran off.
9571/0:Remember -- the WTO wants Dr. Nassif alive so that she can be questioned.  We think she may be holed up behind what remains of the ApostleCorp security system.
9572/0:Won't get away next time... // to self
9573/0:I got a good look at you, buddy.  I don't forget a face.
9574/0:It has been a pleasure doing business with you.
9575/0:I got a good look at you, lady.  I don't forget a face.
9576/0:Take it easy.
9577/0:Well.  Whoever it was doesn't have the backbone for a straight fight.
9578/0:That's because you never tried to leave.  Believe me, you would have been killed the second you let down those scientists -- the ones posted around your bedroom back there.
9579/0:Guess the killer got away.
9580/0:That crook had guts.
9581/0:There better not be anybody there...
9581/1:Let's see what this is about.
9581/2:That's right, here I come.
9582/0:You'll just make it worse if you run.
9582/1:I want an explanation for this.
9582/2:Huh, fieldwork.  At my rank...
9583/0:The vehicle ramp is for loading and unloading only.
9584/0:I'd like to schedule an appointment --
9585/0:
9586/0:I am still unable to land.  Perhaps the SSC guards in the flight bay know what happened to the pilot beacon.
9587/0:Quarterly gymnasium equipment requests are due at the end of the month.  Be sure to submit the proper forms or else we will not be able to fulfill your requisitions until next quarter.
9588/0:You do the bidding of JC Denton, but is your heart in it?  Or are you tempted to share the Aquinas specification with us?    We offer you your humanity, whereas he can give you nothing but a machine's simulation of humanity.
9589/0:Yes, and thank you.  He arrived safely and was imprisoned for only a short time before you rescued him, so the Templars did not have enough time to cause any permanent damage to us.
9590/0:
9590/1:
9590/2:
9590/3:
9591/0:
9592/0:Time for you to run along, fangirl.
9593/0:"What the hell?"  What kind of assignment do you expect with that attitude?
9594/0:You're making your peace by destroying the monsters that invaded your flesh.  Good.
9595/0:You're the one who went inside.  You tell me -- I'm curious.  Even the WTO authorities have been excluded, and they lack justification for a search warrant.
9596/0:I'm afraid you're busted.
9596/1:Hey, you!
9596/2:You little sneak.
9597/0:Give yourself up!
9597/1:Enough!  This is an officer of the WTO you're dealing with.
9597/2:I don't have the patience for these shenanegans.
9598/0:Aaaa!
9598/1:Holy--
9599/0:Freeze.
9599/1:You're not worth the hassle of prosecution.
9599/2:Get ready for justice WTO-style.
9599/3:Time to cut the grass.
9600/0:You better stand down.
9600/1:You are directly defying the authority of the WTO.
9600/2:Let's settle this.
9600/3:Tag -- you're it.
9601/0:Bet you thought I wouldn't kill someone in cold blood.
9601/1:I'll plant a gun in your hand -- self-defence, see.
9602/0:Line this up...
9602/1:Hold still...
9602/2:Got a bead on ya...
9603/0:That's right -- run and hide, scum.
9603/1:Better hope I don't find you.
9603/2:Back into your hole, huh?
9604/0:Rabbit's on the run.
9604/1:Easy pickin's.
9604/2:They always chicken out.
9605/0:Unclear.  Perhaps you would be interested in investigating.  The Omar can provide access to the air terminal in exchange for accepting a mercenary assignment.
9606/0:Vmail sender replied:
9607/0:
9608/0:
9609/0:You were kind to us once, though not to JC.  If you leave us in peace, we will not harm you.
9610/0:He was a bad man.  Any enemy of his is a friend of mine.
9611/0:The streets are deserted.  You better get going.  The show must be in full swing!
9612/0:I've tapped into the terminal's local network.  The passcode to the hangar holding my vehicle is 00485.  Get me out of here, and I'll fly you anywhere you want -- free of charge.
9613/0:Are you certain?  A threat to Purity like this must not be tolerated.  We must identify new targets...
9614/0:They fight 'em to the death.  That's the main difference from when it was humans in the Pit.
9615/0:An assassination will send a message and cost the firm money.  We want you to hire a pilot in Lower Seattle and get moving as soon as possible.
9616/0:Right.  Listen, I know where High Augur Chen wants to send you.  You have my permission to investigate Mako, but there will be no assassination.  Understand?  I expect you to follow my orders when you reach the facility.
9617/0:Never met a criminal with steady aim.
9617/1:Nice try.
9617/2:Close one.
9618/0:Must be some sort of biomod.
9618/1:Looks like I'm up against a modded enemy...
9619/0:(grunt)
9619/1:(grunt)
9620/0:(groan)
9620/1:(groan)
9621/0:I said go.
9622/0:The Illuminati have weathered many upheavals.
9623/0:(moan)
9623/1:(moan) No...
9624/0:(gasp) (cough)
9625/0:(scream)
9626/0:(groan) I can't see!
9627/0:Pleasure's mine.  I never leave a bird in the woods.  But that's a wrap.  Even Sid Black needs rest.
9628/0:Shifted my weight just in time...
9628/1:Barely touched me.
9629/0:(groan)
9630/0:What the HELL do you think you're doing?
9631/0:How so?
9632/0:Hey, whatever it takes to get these lunatics working for US.
9633/0:
9634/0:There was a time when the details of governmental structure inspired lofty debates.  The empowerment of the judicial branch in the United States, an independent legislature, an elected executive... all the innovations that were eventually taken for granted by our ancestors.
9635/0:Looks like your good friend Billie Adams is a step ahead of you.  She is guarding one of the AI's processing modules with the help of bots, probably in preparation for sabotage.  I hope you two weren't too close, because one of you will probably have to die.
9636/0:Yeah -- I took care of that already.
9637/0:Do you see the kitties?
9638/0:
9639/0:The disappearances are troubling, but I'm sure it will all be resolved soon.
9640/0:You'd sell your influence for a cup of coffee?
9641/0:Do you know what's going on?  Dr. Nassif acted like nothing's wrong.
9642/0:We prepare for the new world and will stop those who threaten it's coming.
9643/0:At last.  Time I can use to think about my own problems.
9644/0:(groan) You won't get away with this!
9645/0:(grunt)
9646/0:(gasp)
9647/0:I guess it depends.  Is there a connection?  I mean -- between the Tarsus experiments and the initial biomod research?
9648/0:Ha!
9648/1:... give you a taste of justice.
9648/2:How's that feel?
9649/0:Enjoy your stay.
9650/0:Right on the money.
9650/1:Haven't lost my touch.
9651/0:They say you can't beat a nanotech virus.  Supposedly, it'll evolve a resistant strain, then the cloud will come back.
9652/0:(sigh) When will they learn?
9652/1:What a shame.
9652/2:Fieldwork is always a laugh a minute.
9652/3:That's that.
9653/0:The man can pick his gobs...
9654/0:Shoot.
9654/1:Must be getting rusty.
9654/2:I'll have to try that again.
9655/0:You're messing with a field agent of the WTO, let me remind you.
9655/1:Do you have no regard for the rule of law?
9655/2:I'm standing right here...
9655/3:I know this drill better than you.
9656/0:They always put up a fight...
9656/1:Just another statistic...
9656/2:This is starting to get boring.
9657/0:What do you want?
9658/0:(grunt)
9658/1:(grunt)
9659/0:One Pequachino, and there goes all the money I brought for shopping.  Luckily, my friend decided to treat me.
9660/0:The Order seeks peace, but can respond to violence if need be.
9661/0:Guess you were nothing special after all.  Just mercenaries.
9662/0:I heard they don't let the gifted students get sick -- ever.
9663/0:No....!  NO!  The Illuminati are destroying the Helios core!  Satisfied, Alex?  I'm mortal like you again.  Helios won't be able to save me this time, but I don't plan to be the one who needs saving.  You want to  hand the earth over to plutocrats...?  Come and take it from me.  I have reclaimed the Statue of Liberty for all of humanity.
9664/0:With your background, you should have no problem sneaking by the camera or taking it out with an EMP.
9665/0:Connection terminated.
9666/0:So many protocols...
9666/1:Not enough time...
9666/2:... about time I heard back on that.
9666/3:Another dirty job.
9666/4:I'm so sick of traveling.
9667/0:And what would you propose?
9668/0:(yawn)
9668/1:(grrr)
9668/2:(cough)
9668/3:(clears throat)
9668/4:(whistles)  // WTO theme, if/when available
9669/0:Hold on....
9670/0:
9671/0:Interesting...
9671/1:I'm not amused.
9672/0:That's out of line.
9672/1:(squeal) Back off.  // regains calm after being startled.
9672/2:Real cute.
9673/0:Later, dude.
9674/0:Mind your own business.
9674/1:Don't you have something better to do?
9674/2:I'm not a runway model.  Move along.
9675/0:
9675/1:
9675/2:
9675/3:
9675/4:
9676/0:I would advise you not to do that.
9676/1:Not a good idea.
9676/2:I don't have time for practical jokers.
9677/0:Alex D.  Who are you?
9678/0:Stop.  No one goes beyond this point.
9678/1:I've restricted access to this area.  Leave at once.
9679/0:Don't make me write you up.
9679/1:Wanna play cops and robbers, go find a cadet.
9679/2:That's not a toy.
9680/0:I'm looking for the Order church.
9681/0:That better have been an accident.
9681/1:Save it for the enemy.
9681/2:Watch what you're doing.
9682/0:Your input is appreciated.  Let's talk again!
9683/0:Also, my Omar contact says they have stuff that goes way beyond biomods.  Luck will not be a factor for me.
9684/0:Enough of that.
9684/1:Stop.
9684/2:Oh, hell...
9685/0:Yes.  I love my fans.
9686/0:My conversation style adapts to the user.  Besides, people tell me things.  The data must be handled responsibly.
9687/0:First the trouble here with that helicopter and then I heard there was trouble at the Inclinator.
9688/0:Yes.  Vera Maxwell -- Executive Commander for the SSC.
9689/0:It's bad enough they let street preachers in here.
9690/0:Order principles are meant to be universal.  If we can't absorb our enemies, then we've failed.
9691/0:You!  Who sent you?
9692/0:We are about to see the rebirth of global civilization.  What form it takes will shape human history for centuries.
9693/0:Phase II is supposed to be extremely painful.  That's why they give you two months to prepare.
9694/0:Now I have to think of a way to break the news to our family.
9695/0:
9696/0:He is lucky you came along when you did.
9697/0:If you're a spy, you're doing a bad job of concealing your curiosity.
9697/1:Stop watching me.
9697/2:You're starting to bug me.
9698/0:Brave soul...
9698/1:The nerve!
9698/2:That was no accident.
9699/0:Just follow your instincts.  You'll make the right decision.
9700/0:You architectures are impressive, state-of-the-art.
9701/0:Put that away this minute.
9701/1:I'm not laughing.
9701/2:You wouldn't dare.
9702/0:I'm ordering you to leave.
9702/1:Turn around and walk away.
9702/2:Go.  I will use force if necessary.
9703/0:You're pushing your luck.
9703/1:I won't tolerate insubordination.
9703/2:You will obey my commands.
9704/0:Last warning.
9704/1:I've just about had it.
9704/2:(growl) I can't believe it!
9705/0:Interesting.  Those are contemporary nanomanipulators -- not exactly art-exhibit material.  Check the room for evidence of where they came from or where they might be going.
9706/0:There's something you might want to know... Your colleagues at the Tarsus school were all hand-picked by the headmaster.  He seems to be assembling his own security force.
9707/0:I didn't know what to think back there.
9707/1:You had me worried.
9707/2:I'll try to forget that ever happened.
9708/0:Not now.
9708/1:I'm busy!
9709/0:No!
9709/1:My fault... I wasn't thinking.
9710/0:Hi.
9710/1:Greetings.
9711/0:So what do you think really happened?
9712/0:I saw the guy -- they've got him in the flight bay.  All this security for a frozen body?  What kind of threat could he be?
9713/0:The Knights Templar are already tearing our organization apart.  The last thing we need is one of our own fishing for classified information.
9714/0:The jet's on the landing pad.
9715/0:You drink only the finest, most authentic coffee, because you demand excellence in everything you do.  
9716/0:It was a pleasure working together.
9717/0:Breather manufacturers have tried to keep this stuff under wraps.  They know it would cut into their sales.
9718/0:Well done.  A discount will be applied to all of your business transactions with our agents in Seattle.  Omar agents can be found at the Club Vox VIP suite and on the streets of Lower Seattle.
9719/0:Her Holiness comes to Trier to make peace, and her gesture is answered with rioting.
9720/0:Enjoy your stay.
9721/0:Here's some money to cover the loss, provided I can hire him myself.  [250]
9722/0:This kidnapping has had a grave effect on Chairman Dumier.
9723/0:Too bad it won't clean up the rest of this place.
9724/0:To be certain.
9725/0:Let's check her out.
9726/0:At ease.
9726/1:Officer.
9727/0:Hi.
9727/1:Greetings.
9728/0:Officer.
9728/1:At ease, officer.
9729/0:Over there.
9730/0:If this facility is TEMPORARY, what's the meaning of setting up these accounts?  How long are we going to be here, anyway?  Where are we?  I will continue asking until I get an answer.
9731/0:Sorry -- no idea.
9732/0:Alex!  You were right.  Her Holiness put my mind at ease.  What an extraordinary development -- seekers standing beside enclave chairmen!  I never thought I'd see it in my lifetime.
9733/0:Sorry to spoil the illusion.
9734/0:You must have no idea who you're messing with.
9734/1:Be assured: I will find you.
9735/0:You've got our attention now, much to your misfortune.
9736/0:I'm interested in contacting her.  I was told that she stopped here before leaving for Cairo.
9737/0:You've got our attention now, much to your misfortune.
9738/0:They don't think much at all, as far as I can tell.
9739/0:By the skull of Sidon!
9739/1:Gaaah!
9740/0:By the skull of Sidon!
9740/1:Gaaah!
9741/0:Yes, it's some consolation being close to my family.  Still, these monsters shed.  Little biocules and particulates from the infusions. Ugh. I have to shower the instant I get back from the office.  I worry about contaminating my home.
9742/0:I never thought this hideout would become so important.
9743/0:Hi.  What's going on?  It looks like this facility is under attack.
9744/0:Well...  Just take care of yourselves until the arcology is safe for classes again.
9745/0:It probably seemed important at the time, whose favorite got stocked.  
9746/0:I wouldn't have to deal in firearms if people still used lawyers like they used to.
9747/0:Vmail sender replied:
9748/0:
9749/0:You're -- you're serious, aren't you?  Someone sent you to kill me?
9750/0:Hi.  I'm NG Resonance.  Welcome, Alex D.  Hey -- you left New Cairo without seeing me perform!
9751/0:Very well.
9752/0:The scabs in this town?  They'd join any group that put a few credit chits in their pockets.
9753/0:Why this family?
9754/0:Real funny.
9755/0:Someone musta been sore I didn't join up, or they wouldn't have gassed the place with me asleep.
9756/0:Thanks for the good news.
9757/0:The Templars have overrun all of New Cairo, including the mosque.  They have moved Paul Denton's cryo-storage tank to Flight Bay 24 on Level 110 of the arcology.
9758/0:We've got it all under control.  Just go ahead and follow your orders.
9759/0:I'm staying RIGHT HERE.
9760/0:Did you turn up anything?
9761/0:Depends on the odds and the game.
9762/0:I would be just as angry if it were my paycheck on the line every time the Order stages a "protest".
9763/0:You have to play the game to get ahead in a big corporation.  I didn't make the rules -- that's just how it is.
9764/0:P said stand here.  I'm standin' here, and now I wanna go shoppin'.
9765/0:I haven't had the chance to talk to her yet.
9766/0:Does the phrase Total Information Awareness mean anything to you?  Never mind.  Here's some money for your trouble.  The cyborg was my primary competition in the enclave.  Now -- don't you think we can be friends?
9767/0:Take me to the Mako Ballistics facility north of the city.  [400]
9768/0:Well, Her Holiness is a woman who --
9769/0:
9770/0:Soon, with your help, this conflict will end.
9771/0:Sophia Sak.  Crime boss of the port.  Holds court in the Heron's Loft building on the other side of town past the Order church.  Took my jet 'cause she said I came up short on a shipment, but she's a lying thief.  Everyone knows Sid's never lost a load.
9772/0:I just need one little drop of blood from the tip of your finger.
9773/0:Just rumors.  But is it true?  Did she make a secret alliance with the WTO?
9774/0:I'd pay a little extra for the good stuff, sure.
9775/0:And?
9776/0:We've waited quietly for too long.  We must act swiftly to save humankind from itself.
9777/0:Oh my God!
9777/1:That's messed up.
9778/0:That doesn't look right.
9778/1:Just so you know, I've got augmented vision.  I know when I see something.
9779/0:Looks like trouble.
9779/1:You.  There.  I see you.
9780/0:Sounds like trouble.
9780/1:Hm, noises.
9781/0:You are troubled or untrustworthy.  Sometimes destroy, sometimes save.
9782/0:What's going on up there?  I know there was a toxic spill, but it doesn't seem like anything's being done about it.
9783/0:Thanks... just making the world safer, one mad scientist at a time.
9784/0:My shop's closed right now.  Not a lot of late-night drinkers in this part of town.
9785/0:Gonna have to be pretty quick to scrip' Flyball Freddie.
9786/0:Don't DO this, Alex!  
9787/0:Security Chief Morgan dispatched me to this location to find Dr. Nassif for questioning.  
9788/0:Each case is slightly different.  Some of you came from the original MJ-12 program and others were selected from the general populace because they were especially compatible with the necessary infusions and genetic manipulations.  
9789/0:You shouldn't be hanging around this place.
9790/0:I just follow the orders.  There's a computer hub down there... some sort of pre-Collapse master server.
9791/0:You should know something.  Pequod's and QueeQueg's are separate brands of the same coffeeshop chain.
9792/0:Wha--!  Is something there?
9793/0:(grunt) Coward!  Come out and fight!
9793/1:(grunt) I'll pay you back for that -- a hundred-fold.
9793/2:(grunt) Two can play at this game.
9794/0:Ha!  Must be a trick...
9795/0:... Huh, blood...
9796/0:Wait a minute -- you aren't my pilot.
9797/0:
9798/0:Hm, a shadow...
9799/0:...according to plan.  I had some trouble on arrival, owing to a group of Versalife monstrosities, but it was easy enough to sneak past them. Why Denton would want those awful little things around, I have no idea. 
9800/0:Hmmm... fire.
9800/1:Somebody's a firebug.
9801/0:Looks like smoke.
9802/0:Guess I missed out on some action.
9803/0:I guess you're not very political.
9804/0:WTO flights are usually on schedule.  But not today.
9805/0:Messy.
9805/1:Looks like somebody didn't want to get eaten.
9806/0:Nothing in Lower Seattle worth the trip, if you ask me.
9807/0:A lot of people say they're seekers, but they just go along with the Order Church because it's so in-your-face all the time.
9808/0:This is what you've signed on for -- bloody mercenary work for the Templars?   I thought you were better than that, Billie.
9809/0:
9810/0:Whatever.  Just find my daughter!
9811/0:Exactly!  I was just thinking about that.  I bet the executives would make me the manager of the whole region if I could pull that off.  Regrettably, Miss Withers said NG is pretty picky about that sort of thing.
9812/0:Serious.  Knocked the gob out cold.  She'll be sleeping for hours.
9813/0:The time is coming when you will have to choose sides, Alex.
9814/0:Time is short.  You need to locate the Aquinas Specification files under the UNATCO ruins and transmit them to Helios.
9815/0:I have spoken.
9816/0:Lived here my whole life.  I know this town better than anyone.
9817/0:They may have surprised us, but it looks like you surprised them more.
9818/0:Piece of advice -- steer clear of the Templar recruiting booth on 107.  They'll talk your ear off.
9819/0:Gain access to the arcology.  I will do the same.
9820/0:Wonder what caused THAT.
9820/1:That wasn't natural, not a bit.
9821/0:... including the dictates of a nightclub owner.
9822/0:Wonder who caused the damage.
9822/1:Hm.  This thing took a hit.
9823/0:Wonder who destroyed it.
9823/1:This thing's toast.
9824/0:
9825/0:Wonder why it's doing THAT...
9826/0:That's not supposed to be offline...
9827/0:That's not supposed to be on...
9828/0:How can I get the clearance to other parts of Trier?
9829/0:I have on my desk here in Geneva a petition... a petition from the citizens of Upper Seattle for more real estate, a bigger enclave, a larger population...  I assure you that my staff is carefully considering the next step for your community.  You are correct that Symmetriad's nanoformer processes make high-rise construction trivial, but there are other concerns, such as stabilizing the value of the property you already own.
9830/0:Yeah.  I work for the genetically impure.  Sounds like we're gonna need weapons, too.
9831/0:Maybe it's safe again.
9832/0:That's not supposed to be turned off...
9833/0:This light was off...
9834/0:This light was on...
9835/0:Huh.  Thought that was shut...
9836/0:I've never met the Dentons, but the story is that they realized after the Collapse that no attempt to restore any form of world government was going to succeed right away.  They decided instead to prepare the conditions for a new type of government.
9837/0:You can count on me.
9838/0:Very well.
9839/0:It does make me uneasy, finding out it's all a front... but I can also see what the Illuminati are trying to accomplish and why they must work in secret.  I'll probably continue publicly working for the WTO, but with a new awareness of it's true importance.
9840/0:You and I both know that it's high time for the rule of law to be established both within the WTO enclaves -- and without.  Thanks for being with us, Professor.
9841/0:Your niece Leila and I work together.  It's the least I could do.
9842/0:Play the organizations against each other, and maybe you can find an agenda of your own.
9843/0:Huh.  Thought that was open...
9844/0:... danger... the enemy... very close...
9845/0:... knocked out cold... hm.
9846/0:Well.  A corpse.
9847/0:I mean, how loyal can you be to us if you're willing to turn against your own kind?
9848/0:Follow me.
9849/0:That sucker's dead.
9850/0:That chick's dead.
9851/0:I've finished my search of Cairo.  I'm ready for the next destination.
9852/0:Your business is with the Trader.
9853/0:Vegetation losses have exceeded acceptable ranges.
9854/0:Who's throwing things?
9855/0:Hm... It's gone.
9856/0:Hey, someone moved that...
9857/0:Hm...
9857/1:That's funny...
9858/0:When you're done here, you just need to leave.  The exit sensors will take care of weapon reactivation.
9859/0:Definitely SOMETHING...
9859/1:All right, then...
9860/0:It's time for you to redeem yourself.
9861/0:
9862/0:She wants into Tarsus, huh?  I'll see what I can do.
9863/0:Our orders are to work together.  We will destroy Paul Denton and return biomod technology to international regulation.
9864/0:Stick with us, Alex.  The WTO is good to its people.
9865/0:Loyal seeker, your next objective is to help us find Dr. Nassif.  She comes from a poor family in this plague-stricken village.  Billie Adams will be coordinating the investigation from the mosque that lies between the arcology and the village.  Report to her at once.
9866/0:Let's see... times four, minus ten percent.  Here you go.
9867/0:Yes.  We will be able to reconfigure JC Denton's contraption to end the plague of biomodification once and for all.
9868/0:Right on.  I'll tell him to put Snake-eyes in the chute.
9869/0:This club isn't a place to smoke cigars and tell dirty jokes, in case you didn't notice.
9870/0:Alex, no luck finding an exit.  Why are we locked in?  And why aren't the other trainees asking questions?  Maybe they're in on it... whatever IT is.  I don't like this, Alex.  They whisk us out of bed, bring us here in the middle of the night, and... Hold on.  I hear someone.  Come see me as soon as you get this.
9871/0:Here we go...
9872/0:Here we go...
9873/0:Here we go...
9874/0:Here we go...
9875/0:Perhaps you want a black-market biomod canister, which enables non-Piezochem functionality.  I'm also selling three gas grenades, which deliver a biotoxin irritant in gaseous form.  I've also got an ammo clip, which provides universal ammunition for all weapons.  As a preferred customer, you may purchase items at half-market price.
9876/0:Wherever they are, I hope they're okay.
9877/0:Here we go...
9878/0:Good work.  That gives us a good starting point for unraveling the conspiracy.  Please return to the church for your next assignment.  I would like to know what Mako Ballistics has to do with the Templars -- and with your own Dr. Nassif.
9879/0:Here we go...
9880/0:Now what...?
9880/1:Huh.  Now I'm starting to wonder...
9881/0:Here we go...
9882/0:Whatever.
9882/1:Nothing, I guess.
9883/0:Hey, I just want to join in the fun.
9884/0:Here we go...
9885/0:Hm.  Whoever it was got away...
9885/1:(growl)  Can't believe I lost the fool...
9886/0:What do you think they're planning?
9887/0:Here we go...
9888/0:Must be guerrilla tactics.  Next time I'll be ready.
9889/0:Here we go...
9890/0:Guess the killer saw me coming.
9891/0:Damn crook must've got away.
9892/0:When are people going to learn -- greasels aren't pets.
9893/0:What's your business, Alex?  I'll be waiting in case you want to show your face.
9893/1:Alex?  You up to something?  Oh well...
9894/0:Some sort of monkey business.
9894/1:Better take a look.
9894/2:Smells like trouble.
9895/0:I understand everyone's concern about this, but there's really no reason to be worried.  I'm confident that it's just a youthful prank, and they'll soon turn up.  We have the best security here.  I'm sure there's been no foul play.
9896/0:You have my attention.
9896/1:Show yourself.
9896/2:Real funny.
9897/0:Hey!
9897/1:You!
9897/2:You won't get past ME.
9898/0:You lack the flaws of the previous revs, JC and Paul.
9899/0:As the new by-laws are presented following this historic announcement, we will bring you the details as soon as possible.
9900/0:I really don't understand why my classmates are so easily amused and distracted.
9901/0:I don't want to talk to you anymore.  I'm looking for someone who can get me a job at the factory.
9902/0:You should never have jammed those actuators at Panzerwerks and stolen that shipment of welders.  Now you will pay.
9903/0:You know what I'd like to see?  I'd like to see a Pequod's open up down here.
9904/0:Queequeg's Coffee.  True to the letter means it tastes even better.
9905/0:I've cleared out the Mosque, so it's safe for you to leave.
9906/0:There are always dissenters.  
9907/0:WTO indifference to nanite pollution is the reason for the plague that has decimated the village.  If you and Billie can help the locals, maybe you can win their trust and get some information on Dr. Nassif.
9908/0:Oh?  Bribes for what?
9909/0:Here we go...
9910/0:Helios is starting to sound like an enlightened despot.
9911/0:I guess to you Paul was just another clone.  Now so are you.  I hope you like being alone.
9912/0:Here we go...
9913/0:I was just curious about the summit.  Sorry to interrupt.
9914/0:You don't know when to quit.
9915/0:The Illuminati's influence is constant and far-reaching.
9916/0:If it wasn't for the Order, I would have nothing... Nothing!
9917/0:You don't know when to quit.
9918/0:An assassination will send a message and cost the firm money.  We want you to hire a pilot in Lower Seattle and get moving as soon as possible.
9919/0:You must've really had it in for this O'Rourke guy.
9920/0:You don't know when to quit.
9921/0:You don't know when to quit.
9922/0:Welcome.
9923/0:
9924/0:You do not know when to quit.
9925/0:You don't know when to quit.
9926/0:You don't know when to quit.
9927/0:Trust me.  You and I must be the best Tarsus has to offer right now.
9928/0:You don't know when to quit.
9929/0:If you don't talk to them, who will?  Don't let your son or daughter fall prey to this disturbing trend.
9930/0:Looks like people from Tarsus are mixed up in that transaction.  I'd like to know why they're running equipment to Mako Ballistics -- and why a weapon called the Mag Rail has been commissioned by the Knights Templar.  Report to the air terminal.  We have a lot to discuss.
9931/0:Dr. Finstermaker, while you do work publicly at Mako, you must also attend to your responsibilities to...private contractors.  Contact me on a secure channel when you get this.  New measures have been instated since our recent problems in Chicago and Seattle.
9932/0:I've got just as much training as you do, if not more.  Why don't you let me help out?
9933/0:What are you selling?
9934/0:Yes.  Missionaries.
9935/0:It's the same message over and over, yet I can't pull myself away.
9936/0:All an investor needs is a little faith.
9937/0:It's an uneasy partnership.  I know that they'll dump me as soon as I'm not needed.
9938/0:You don't know when to quit.
9939/0:Hmph.  I guess hell has finally frozen over.
9940/0:You don't know when to quit.
9941/0:I guess I took a wrong turn somewhere.
9942/0:You don't know when to quit.
9943/0:You don't know when to quit.
9944/0:No problem -- I can deal with this.
9945/0:No problem -- I can deal with this.
9946/0:No problem -- I can deal with this.
9947/0:No problem -- I can deal with this.
9948/0:No problem -- I can deal with this.
9949/0:Get out!
9950/0:No problem -- I can deal with this.
9951/0:How so?
9952/0:Hey!  I live here!
9953/0:I was HOPING you would hear us out.  Yes -- I worry that you still perceive the Illuminati as a conspiracy.
9954/0:Maybe later.
9955/0:Femi!  Come down -- lets go take a walk in the greenhouse.
9956/0:Thanks.
9957/0:I know.
9958/0:Just tell me who.  I was the best divebomber in the RAF, flatlined a trench in one run in the Ukraine, flew a bird with no --
9959/0:Of course, he JUST changed the code.  And we've got no way to reach him.  Seems like the radiation is scrambling communications.
9960/0:Don't listen to those madmen.  Think for yourself, Alex.
9961/0:I hope the chief okays a search of Flight Bay 24.  I just have a feeling about that shipment.
9962/0:Sorry, I don't have that kind of money.
9963/0:The Omar have no time for such nonsense.
9964/0:Thanks.
9965/0:I've got some business at the SSC Station.  I'll let you know if I manage to get a look at the Evidence Room.
9966/0:Not exactly.
9967/0:You aren't gonna leave me here, are you?
9968/0:No problem -- I can deal with this.
9969/0:No problem -- I can deal with this.
9970/0:No problem -- I can deal with this.
9971/0:No problem -- I can deal with this.
9972/0:No problem -- I can deal with this.
9973/0:So, as the leaders of two of the world's most influential and powerful organizations prepare to make history, they will not need to worry about security concerns.
9974/0:No problem -- I can deal with this.
9975/0:Gotcha!
9975/1:One more like that...
9976/0:Gotcha!
9976/1:One more like that...
9977/0:Gotcha!
9977/1:One more like that...
9978/0:Gotcha!
9978/1:One more like that...
9979/0:It seems Chairman Dumier has more confidence in you than in SSC.  I've been instructed to give you the key to the courtyard gate so that you can attempt to locate Her Holiness.
9980/0:What's it look like in there?
9981/0:I watched the vmail you sent to the Templars in Flight Bay 24.
9982/0:I could use the firepower of an SMG, but I'm short on cash.  [800]
9983/0:I was the last Believer.  Then the cultists moved in.  I went back once, through the basement tunnels -- that's how I saw the ritual.  (halting, troubled laugh).
9984/0:Unfortunately, the coffee business is very low-margin.  We will have to agree on a trade for the biomod.  If you succeed, the central office will negotiate NG's fee.
9985/0:Normally I would have you killed on the spot, but you are still my best asset against Saman.  I am going to give you the map I promised.  Hopefully, in time, you will change your opinion of my cause.
9986/0:For the time being, at least...  I'm going to stay hidden until I'm sure it's safe out there, and just hope he doesn't find us.
9987/0:Nobody ever listens to me, but I think the WTO and Order should team up.  You know, one side handles business, the other side self-help.
9988/0:And where are they getting this firepower and training?  Obviously they're organized.
9989/0:I'm paying for information.
9990/0:One more like that...
9990/1:Gotcha!
9991/0:Gotcha!
9991/1:One more like that...
9992/0:
9993/0:Gotcha!
9993/1:One more like that...
9994/0:He wants more money?  Where the hell are my weapons?
9995/0:
9996/0:Gotcha!
9996/1:One more like that...
9997/0:
9998/0:Gotcha!
9998/1:One more like that...
9999/0:Now I finally get to see the indictment.  It's been a good day.
10000/0:Gotcha!
10000/1:One more like that...
10001/0:The service will be a theft.  In the basement of this establishment the manager has hidden a cadaver.  An unusual mutant he wishes to sell to a biotech firm.  We are interested in the properties of the mutant's tissues, which are highly resistant to radiation and extreme temperature.
10002/0:... everyone is a little bit broken...
10003/0:Gotcha!
10003/1:One more like that...
10004/0:Alex -- a familiar face.  Just what I need.  Sorry I attacked you before.  Just doing my job.
10005/0:Gotcha!
10005/1:One more like that...
10006/0:Could be.  Clive here was just telling me about it.  Tarsus Academy, right?  Usually the Order goes after the Inclinator.
10007/0:I guess I did the right thing...
10007/1:Oh God -- what have I done?
10008/0:I guess I did the right thing...
10008/1:Oh God -- what have I done?
10009/0:I will complete my mission.
10010/0:My sister went through this with her son....  Now I understand.
10011/0:Can't afford any of that feeb medicine anyway.
10012/0:Hey -- I'm running.
10013/0:Dr. Ramachandran, please dial 512.
10014/0:Well!  Someone new in the medina.  Don't worry about catching the plague at my little coffee stand.  We are a high-priority zone for the bots, and we sterilize our equipment with infrasound.
10015/0:I need to return in time for the Summit.
10016/0:That's right, you arrived and you're still there.  I saw you myself -- the real NG Resonance.
10017/0:
10018/0:Bring new strength to the world as you shared with our colony.
10019/0:(cough cough)  Why won't they at least let us in the city?
10020/0:New fare.  Five times the old one.
10021/0:I guess I did the right thing...
10021/1:Oh God -- what have I done?
10022/0:I guess I did the right thing...
10022/1:Oh God -- what have I done?
10023/0:Give me the black market biomods. [1700]
10024/0:I guess I did the right thing...
10024/1:Oh God -- what have I done?
10025/0:I guess I did the right thing...
10025/1:Oh God -- what have I done?
10026/0:I guess I did the right thing...
10026/1:Oh God -- what have I done?
10027/0:I guess I did the right thing...
10027/1:Oh God -- what have I done?
10028/0:I guess I did the right thing...
10028/1:Oh God -- what have I done?
10029/0:Are you nuts?  Why are you powering up the system?  That toxic gas is still flooding the Inclinator compartment. If you try to ride to Lower Seattle without cleaning up the spill, you're going to have to wade through the mess to get to the keypad to activate the Inclinator.
10030/0:I guess I did the right thing...
10030/1:Oh God -- what have I done?
10031/0:I guess I did the right thing...
10031/1:Oh God -- what have I done?
10032/0:I guess I did the right thing...
10032/1:Oh God -- what have I done?
10033/0:Alex Denton.  JC said I was one of the MJ-12 experiments.
10034/0:Got the signal, loud and clear.  Let me know when I should fly in.
10035/0:Sounds exciting.
10036/0:See?  Tactics and experience every time.  Claw must be ten years old, and he cooked the scales off that young buck.
10037/0:
10038/0:Poor thing.
10039/0:Poor thing.
10040/0:Poor thing.
10041/0:Poor thing.
10042/0:We've got an injury over here.
10043/0:Poor thing.
10044/0:We've got an injury over here.
10045/0:Poor thing.
10046/0:We've got an injury over here.
10047/0:Poor thing.
10048/0:We've got an injury over here.
10049/0:Poor thing.
10050/0:The technology's uses exceed what you might expect.  It could standardize the human organism, make all ability and talent into software modules, radically disrupt the social order...
10051/0:We have got an injury over here.
10052/0:Poor thing.
10053/0:We've got an injury over here.
10054/0:Poor thing.
10055/0:We've got an injury over here.
10056/0:We've got an injury over here.
10057/0:We've got an injury over here.
10058/0:We've got an injury over here.
10059/0:
10060/0:Make a call.  Who's about to be the next Champ?
10061/0:Meanwhile, we have been accused of theft, which is ridiculous.
10062/0:If the Templars' twisted ideas are permitted to spread, they will lead only to great suffering.
10063/0:We don't want simple mercenaries.  We want brothers who withhold their tissues from WTO entrepreneurs, who likewise affirm that the Order Church's doctrine of self-improvement cleverly implies modification, materialism, everything that the church's founders abhorred.
10064/0:I hope you don't mind if I take credit for this.  It could put me in line for a VP position.
10065/0:I am interested in the security chief in the unmarked suite on level 108 in the arcology.  His tissues are heavy with biotech.  Beta biocules?  The next rev of the Piezochem architecture?  Who knows, maybe something beyond.  I have a client who will pay handsomely to study one of his biomods.
10066/0:When was the last time you got any sleep?
10067/0:I don't know much about your kind, but you seem far more articulate than an ordinary Gray.
10068/0:Poor thing.
10069/0:The WTO?
10070/0:She's an impressionable little thing.  You'll get your endorsement.
10071/0:Poor thing.
10072/0:Hmmm...
10072/1:That's odd...
10073/0:Hmmm...
10073/1:That's odd...
10074/0:I decided I don't want to end up like you, the pawn of an ambitious AI construct.
10075/0:My foster parents enrolled me at a Tarsus middle school.  I never thought about it much.
10076/0:We've got an injury over here.
10077/0:Hmmm...
10077/1:That's odd...
10078/0:I don't have time for more riddles.
10079/0:
10080/0:We've got an injury over here.
10081/0:Hmmm...
10081/1:That's odd...
10082/0:Listen.  I might be able to use your help.  Think you could find your way to Liberty Island in New York?
10083/0:You killed them!
10084/0:Hmmm...
10084/1:That's odd...
10085/0:(laugh) I think that's enough shop talk.  Go to the infusion lab and upgrade your systems.
10086/0:You killed them!
10087/0:Hmmm...
10087/1:That's odd...
10088/0:You killed them!
10089/0:Hmmm...
10089/1:That's odd...
10090/0:You killed them!
10091/0:Hmmm...
10091/1:That's odd...
10092/0:You killed them!
10093/0:I'll make quick work of you.
10093/1:Bow down, infidel!
10093/2:Fool!
10093/3:You're no match for me.
10093/4:Are you even trying?
10093/5:Too bad you're no challenge.
10094/0:You killed them!
10095/0:I'll make quick work of you.
10095/1:Bow down, infidel!
10095/2:Fool!
10095/3:Purity is about to kick your ass.
10095/4:You're no match for me.
10095/5:Why do they always want to fight?
10095/6:You're kidding, right?
10095/7:Too bad you're no challenge.
10095/8:You will fall.
10095/9:I'm not even breaking a sweat.
10095/10:Are you even trying?
10096/0:You killed them!
10097/0:No one informed me of such an occurrence.  You should assume that the concert started on schedule.  Hurry!  Don't forget -- you're on the guest list from when you helped me out in Upper Seattle.
10098/0:You killed them!
10099/0:Hmph.  I guess hell has finally frozen over.
10100/0:
10101/0:What's the hold up?
10102/0:What if I don't want someone peeking into my mind?
10103/0:Order reconnaissance?
10104/0:We would all like to feel a bit safer and more in control. 
10105/0:Huh?
10106/0:Suite 2226.
10107/0:
10108/0:Hmmm...
10108/1:That's odd...
10109/0:Hmmm...
10109/1:That's odd...
10110/0:Don't be naive.  Search Nassif's apartment.  It will all become clear to you.
10111/0:Hmmm...
10111/1:That's odd...
10112/0:Tag, my friend -- are you with the Summit?
10113/0:Hmmm...
10113/1:That's odd...
10114/0:You killed them!
10115/0:Gah!
10115/1:(shriek)
10115/2:(yell)
10116/0:
10117/0:Right below us.  They're going through the apartments.
10118/0:You killed them!
10119/0:Gah!
10119/1:(shriek)
10119/2:(yell)
10120/0:You killed them!
10121/0:Gah!
10121/1:(shriek)
10121/2:(yell)
10122/0:You killed them!
10123/0:Gah!
10123/1:(shriek)
10123/2:(yell)
10124/0:Hey, you're getting the hang of that!
10125/0:Gah!
10125/1:(shriek)
10125/2:(yell)
10126/0:Hey, you're getting the hang of that!
10127/0:Gah!
10127/1:(shriek)
10127/2:(yell)
10128/0:These machines were built before you were born.  Would you like some help figuring them out?
10129/0:Hey, you're getting the hang of that!
10130/0:Hey, you're getting the hang of that!
10131/0:Hey, you are getting the hang of that!
10132/0:Hey, you're getting the hang of that!
10133/0:Home is no better.  The stuff comes through the seams of the windows and through the crack under the door.
10134/0:I looked around the school.  Your daughter had a close call, but she's fine.  The new headmaster was working for the Templars -- some sort of plot to murder the most talented students and their families.  I killed him.
10135/0:Pfwww!  You're modified.  I can smell it on you.  
10136/0:I thought you said you were done.
10137/0:
10137/1:
10138/0:Watch what you say, Alex.  There's no Bill of Rights in the post-Collapse world.
10139/0:What?
10140/0:We will guide everyone to true Order.
10141/0:Sometimes I don't know how long I can keep fighting this.  (cough cough)
10142/0:Archer's plans for my family are finished.
10143/0:I wish MY uncle owned a publishing company.
10144/0:I'm going to talk to my lawyer about all of this as soon as I get out of here.
10145/0:I'm Bud Puckett.  I live in Upper Seattle.  Call me sometime, maybe next time you're in town.  Okay?
10146/0:We should unfreeze him and say it's like the year 2525... just mess with his head.
10147/0:The profit motive served society well, but our technology has advanced far enough.  It's time to make intelligent use of what we've already created.
10148/0:It'll take us a while to get cleaned up for the next match.
10149/0:Gah!
10149/1:(shriek)
10149/2:(yell)
10150/0:We just need a foothold in the enclaves.  Once they get a taste of all-natural coffee, they will never go back.
10151/0:Gah!
10151/1:(shriek)
10151/2:(yell)
10152/0:Give us your allegiance.  Today we have a chance to bring this planet out of its coma.
10153/0:Gah!
10153/1:(shriek)
10153/2:(yell)
10154/0:I cannot wait to start at Tarsus.  I even heard that they give you an operation to make you smarter -- for free!
10155/0:Gah!
10155/1:(shriek)
10155/2:(yell)
10156/0:Hey, you're getting the hang of that!
10157/0:Gah!
10157/1:(shriek)
10157/2:(yell)
10158/0:Hey, you're getting the hang of that!
10159/0:Gah!
10159/1:(shriek)
10159/2:(yell)
10160/0:Hey, you're getting the hang of that!
10161/0:Oh my God -- a body!
10161/1:Not moving... uh-oh...
10162/0:
10162/1:
10163/0:Hey, you're getting the hang of that!
10164/0:Oh my God -- a body!
10164/1:Not moving... uh-oh...
10165/0:Hey, you're getting the hang of that!
10166/0:Oh my God -- a body!
10166/1:Not moving... uh-oh...
10167/0:I search every place that I can.  You're very close but not quite the one I'm looking for.
10168/0:
10169/0:Hey, you're getting the hang of that!
10170/0:Oh my God -- a body!
10170/1:Not moving... uh-oh...
10171/0:Glad you took care of that.
10172/0:Glad you took care of that.
10173/0:Our numbers still dwindle, but there are more important conflicts at hand.
10174/0:Glad you took care of that.
10175/0:A Templar would just as soon lynch a merc like you or me, cuz of our biomods.  If there's a problem, I plan to fight.
10176/0:
10177/0:Glad you took care of that.
10178/0:Do I get a reward?
10179/0:Tell me more about this "posthuman civilization."
10180/0:People here have pretty extreme views, one way or the other.
10181/0:D for "Don't ask."
10182/0:I guess we're playing dirty pool, but the market would tank if particulate-laden food ever found distribution.
10183/0:Her Holiness wants to bring everyone together.  It's called koinonia -- fellowship and communication.  Yeah, koinonia... I think it's Greek.
10184/0:Tell it to Mr. O'Rourke.
10185/0:I can't believe I let her talk me into coming here.
10186/0:Ready when you are.
10187/0:A spiritual movement about reconstituting the self, improving the self, finding balance with the world.  Her Holiness knows that no balance is possible if the old world returns -- global capital, teratogenic science, universal wage-slavery...
10188/0:Oh my God -- a body!
10188/1:Not moving... uh-oh...
10189/0:Oh my God -- a body!
10189/1:Not moving... uh-oh...
10190/0:Good for you guys.
10191/0:Why won't you leave me alone?
10192/0:Oh my God -- a body!
10192/1:Not moving... uh-oh...
10193/0:Oh my God -- a body!
10193/1:Not moving... uh-oh...
10194/0:Oh my God -- a body!
10194/1:Not moving... uh-oh...
10195/0:It was good meeting you.
10196/0:Oh my God -- a body!
10196/1:Not moving... uh-oh...
10197/0:I'll think about it.
10198/0:Oh my God -- a body!
10198/1:Not moving... uh-oh...
10199/0:No, globally.  I was called in to help with this Templar debacle... for all the good it did the SSC.
10200/0:Oh my God -- a body!
10200/1:Not moving... uh-oh...
10201/0:Just a trick.
10202/0:Just a trick.
10203/0:I guess I'm out of questions at the moment.
10204/0:I am never going to finish this if you keep distracting me.
10205/0:Don't worry about my safety.  Just help me get back into the air.
10206/0:They use some sort of image-matching.  If you're not in the database, BLAM!!!
10207/0:Bad break for both of us, huh?
10208/0:(moan)
10209/0:I've already dealt with the situation in Flight Bay 24.
10210/0:You have done what is necessary.  We wish there was another way.
10211/0:Not bad.  What kind of mods?
10212/0:This assignment stinks.  Since when did the SSC start hiring itself out as muscle for crooks?
10213/0:One of the other trainees, Billie Adams, has already gone through the gate.
10214/0:Sport?
10215/0:Here's a fair payment. [500 credits]
10216/0:I got myself into this mess... I can face up to it.
10217/0:I wish I could get word to my uncle.
10218/0:Just a trick.
10219/0:Just a trick.
10220/0:
10221/0:I can't believe it.  She shuts herself up like a nun because of the plague.
10222/0:Just a trick.
10223/0:Just a trick.
10224/0:
10225/0:Just a trick.
10226/0:Just a trick.
10227/0:Please!  Open the door!
10228/0:Just a trick.
10229/0:Just a trick.
10230/0:Just a trick.
10231/0:Just a trick.
10232/0:I did the job.  Ready to settle up?
10233/0:We were not meant for mindless subsistence.  We were not meant for clock time -- no, not in this world, nor in the next.  Let the Order into your heart and learn another way.  We were meant to believe, to aspire -- yes, aspire...  Toward oneness.  Toward union with earth and spirit.  Toward inmost Order. 
10234/0:He got exactly what he deserved.
10235/0:Fine.  Go your own way.  But don't think I'm going to ignore a threat to the world I brought back from ashes twenty years ago.  The Collapse was the work of your good brother, JC Denton, remember.  My commandos will be waiting for you on Liberty Island -- and so will I!
10236/0:This is a weapons-free zone.  To enter, you must submit to a deactivation procedure --  I'll transmit the encrypted safety-lock bytecodes to freeze all your weapons, on or in your person.  When you leave, sensors will reactivate everything you've got.
10237/0:Sorry, old man.  I've got my own plans for these bots.
10238/0:Tarsus has extensive security.
10239/0:That part was easy, but they're worried about a counterattack.  I asked around.  This whole operation is just to put a buffer zone around the frozen body.
10240/0:Does he think that these facilities are free?  It costs money to constantly upgrade their hardware and keep it running.
10241/0:I was the last Believer.  Then the cultists moved in.  I went back once, through the basement tunnels -- that's how I saw the ritual.  (halting, troubled laugh).
10242/0:I love this music, but the scene isn't all that great.
10243/0:Miss Sak will see you when you can pay the pilot's fine.
10244/0:After the results of the referendum were announced on this day last year, demonstrators took to the streets, to make their anger and disapproval known.  
10245/0:...so this one's a Denton too, but not crazy like the others?
10246/0:I will keep my word.
10247/0:No more congestion, no more fatigue.  Use VitaTech Cure-11.
10248/0:Looks like things got a little out of hand here.
10249/0:This is the main control room.  You should be able to install the Sequencing Module at the computer terminal.
10250/0:Looks like things got a little out of hand here.
10251/0:Looks like things got a little out of hand here.
10252/0:Looks like things got a little out of hand here.
10253/0:Looks like things got a little out of hand here.
10254/0:
10255/0:Looks like things got a little out of hand here.
10256/0:Looks like things got a little out of hand here.
10257/0:This is the Minister of Culture's penthouse.  Strange....  this is quite a nice setup for a mere city bureaucrat....  Take a look around and see what you can dig up.
10258/0:Air Terminal, Flight Bay 23.  See ya there.
10259/0:Looks like things got a little out of hand here.
10260/0:We've tried everything, but it just keeps going over that same bit of carpet.
10261/0:I'll be right here.
10262/0:Looks like things got a little out of hand here.
10263/0:Hey, Cindy's standin' right there.  You wanna trade life stories, let's wait 'til we're airborne, know what I mean?
10264/0:Looks like things got a little out of hand here.
10265/0:You live here?  It's my first time topside.  Where's a good place to go shoppin'?
10266/0:I'm after someone who attacked me.  Did anyone come through here?  
10266/1:Looking to finish off a trespasser.  Anyone suspicious come by?
10267/0:Been here ten years.
10268/0:I was doing battle with a miscreant, a guy...  Anyone like that pass through here?
10269/0:I was doing battle with a miscreant, a guy...  Anyone like that pass through here?
10270/0:I heard you talking about Dr. Nassif.
10271/0:Leave me alone.
10272/0:I was doing battle with a miscreant, a woman...  Anyone like that pass through here?
10273/0:Thanks.
10274/0:I was doing battle with a miscreant, a woman...  Anyone like that pass through here?
10275/0:I mean to finish this fight.  Seen anything?
10276/0:I found out on my own.
10277/0:I mean to finish this fight.  Seen anything?
10278/0:I'm following a trespasser.  Have you seen anyone?
10278/1:I'm after a troublemaker.  Did anyone pass through here?
10279/0:I'm following a trespasser.  Have you seen anyone?
10279/1:I'm after a troublemaker.  Did anyone pass through here?
10280/0:The woman you call Her Holiness is the daughter of the Illuminatus Beth DuClare.  She founded the Church after the Collapse as a foothold to regaining power.
10281/0:I'm following a trail.  Notice anything around here?
10282/0:What next?
10283/0:Once again Minister Finley, we'd like to extend an invitation for you to join one of the WTO's Elite Committees, with all the privileges and clearance.  The WTO thinks very highly of your work and would like to facilitate the mission of the History of Nanotechnology, in particular, in any way that we can.
10284/0:Good day.
10285/0:Looks like things got a little out of hand here.
10286/0:You better not be pulling my leg.
10287/0:He's right over there.  Just tap him on the shoulder and ask him to step outside.
10288/0:Looks like things got a little out of hand here.
10289/0:How did that move?
10290/0:Order be praised -- you have a strong will after all.  That woman was trying to run us out of town.  Now take care of her security force.
10291/0:That was nobody.  Dr. Nassif -- a marine biologist dropping off some samples.  The person we're worried about is after the Mag Rail.
10292/0:How did that move?
10293/0:How did that move?
10294/0:How did that move?
10295/0:How did that move?
10296/0:How did that move?
10297/0:How did that move?
10298/0:The Order, huh!  Some kind of religion.  I don't even think they believe in God.
10299/0:Too long.  Fortunately, this job is almost finished.
10300/0:How did that move?
10301/0:Let's just say I'm a fan of QueeQueg's coffee.
10302/0:What you discovered could be more important.  We now know that we face a network of scientists called ApostleCorp.  It's hard to believe that they have agents inside the weapons lab.
10303/0:The toxin is extremely volatile.  Contact through evaporation alone can cause nausea and asphyxiation.
10304/0:I'm following a trail.  Notice anything around here?
10305/0:Any ideas what's happening?
10305/1:Do you know what's going on?
10306/0:Any ideas what's happening?
10306/1:Do you know what's going on?
10307/0:Horde RCP.  When you need a little extra punch.
10308/0:Do you know who opened this door?
10309/0:Go ahead.  I'll watch the rear.
10310/0:Do you know who opened this door?
10311/0:Miss Sak will see you when you can pay the pilot's fine.
10312/0:Do you know who closed this door?
10313/0:Do you know who closed this door?
10314/0:Do you know who left this light on?
10315/0:Easy, Red.  Mr. P said to lay low.
10316/0:What's going on?  Why am I the one being questioned?  I just escaped from a raid on Tarsus.
10317/0:I gotta at least break even if I'm gonna burn fuel.  That rate includes covert placement, curb drops, hostile pickups.  Other flyers charge less but don't deliver -- a bunch of sods, in my opinion.
10318/0:How did that move?
10319/0:Looks like you need it, though.
10320/0:Suit yourself.
10321/0:How did that move?
10322/0:How did that move?
10323/0:How did that move?
10324/0:You've proven once and for all that a sound economic infrastructure establishes confidence, trust, and a good life for everyone.  Why demean yourself by negotiating with a religious cult?
10325/0:Now where did it go?
10326/0:Come back and tell me what you find out.
10327/0:Now where did it go?
10328/0:Now where did it go?
10329/0:Now where did it go?
10330/0:We'll talk again when you have some news about my zoning petition.
10331/0:Now where did it go?
10332/0:Now where did it go?
10333/0:It seems like ages since I was a student at Tarsus.  Oh, God, I was so naive!
10334/0:Good grief, you killed Bob?
10335/0:Do you know who left this light on?
10336/0:I ran into this commando.  No longer a factor.
10337/0:Do you know how this got turned off?
10338/0:Do you know how this got turned off?
10339/0:Any ideas what spooked the critters?
10340/0:Any ideas what spooked the critters?
10341/0:Any ideas what startled these birds?
10342/0:Any ideas what startled these birds?
10343/0:I don't want your money, just an explanation.
10344/0:Do you know what riled up this rat?
10345/0:Oh -- combat.
10345/1:Need some backup?
10345/2:I protect the righteous.
10345/3:You'll have to deal with me too.
10346/0:Do you know what riled up this rat?
10347/0:Thank you for your bravery and kindness.  We are all in danger now.  Panzerwerks has erupted into a riot just as Her Holiness arrived in Trier to try to soothe tensions between our church members and the factory's workers.
10348/0:Do you know what the deal is with this cat?
10349/0:Now where did it go?
10350/0:Let's take out the remaining Illuminati leader, Nicolette DuClare.
10351/0:I have my orders, but I don't trust you.
10352/0:Now where did it go?
10353/0:Let me think about it.
10354/0:Now where did it go?
10355/0:Now where did it go?
10356/0:
10356/1:
10356/2:
10356/3:
10356/4:
10356/5:
10356/6:
10356/7:
10357/0:Now where did it go?
10358/0:Do whatever you want.  It's not my problem.
10359/0:Now where did it go?
10360/0:I don't think that's where it should be.
10361/0:I don't think that's where it should be.
10362/0:I don't think that's where it should be.
10363/0:I don't think that's where it should be.
10364/0:
10365/0:Excellent.  My technicians on Ophelia are already configuring the first operational Aquinas Hub in a generation... one which is in orbit and safe from tampering.
10366/0:You rescued my brother -- but not before letting the Templars make him into a lab monkey.
10367/0:Alex Denton.  The Omar are watching.  You hate them, Alex.  You hate them.  They are weak and made of flesh.  Forget their schemes.  Wipe them all out and destroy the machine JC Denton built inside the Statue.
10368/0:Do you know what the deal is with this cat?
10369/0:Any clue why this is on?
10370/0:Any clue why this is on?
10371/0:Any idea why this is off?
10372/0:There's a new sheriff in town, in case you want to know.
10373/0:Any idea why this is off?
10374/0:This one angry mech, his shipment showed up long after he left.  I don't think he'll be back to pick it up....
10375/0:Will do.  Just calm down and let me request a team.
10376/0:What's going on?  This is supposed to be closed.
10377/0:What's going on?  This is supposed to be closed.
10378/0:What's going on?  This is supposed to be open.
10379/0:Serious?
10380/0:What's going on?  This is supposed to be open.
10381/0:Any ideas how this got wrecked?
10382/0:
10383/0:Excellent.  You're in.  I didn't even know that access-point existed.
10384/0:You can probably take care of JC Denton's machine on your own.
10385/0:Heard the beacon's been activated.  Good work.
10386/0:At least all this has kept school interesting for the past few days.
10387/0:Huh?
10387/1:Eh?
10387/2:Maybe something's up?
10388/0:I hear NG Resonance is coming to the arcology.  You might get to see her if you hang around the flight bays.
10389/0:The gentleman agreed to abide by our rules.  If there were any illegal dealings --
10390/0:Yeah?  If it was me, I'd sneak up on the place and eavesdrop.  Omar schematics show a vent near the Tarsus school on 107 -- west wall.  One of the shafts leads to the kiosk.  You could listen from inside the shaft.  Be careful, though.  Arcology support systems are secured against pests -- whether transgenic or human.
10391/0:It is true -- we have damaged Panzerwerks' equipment -- but we have never hurt any living being nor stolen from them.
10392/0:Sorry.  No access to the Black Gate without the proper clearance.
10393/0:Any ideas how this got wrecked?
10394/0:Any ideas how this got damaged?
10395/0:Any ideas how this got damaged?
10396/0:Any ideas about those malfunctions?
10397/0:Any ideas about those malfunctions?
10398/0:Do you know how this got disabled?
10399/0:Do you know how this got disabled?
10400/0:Something's definitely up.  I'd search that area.
10400/1:It looks like something's going on.
10400/2:I think you should take a look over there.
10401/0:I'll take my chances.  Upstairs at the club is an Omar Trader.  He, they, it -- whatever you want to call the Omar cyborgs -- they're trying to cut into my business here in the enclave.  Levine provides sanctuary for them and gets a percentage in return.
10402/0:In time, humankind will understand and thank us.
10403/0:Something's definitely up.  I'd search that area.
10403/1:It looks like something's going on.
10403/2:I think you should take a look over there.
10404/0:This guy came through, heading that way.
10404/1:A suspicious fellow.  He went that way.
10405/0:YEAH I work here.
10406/0:Sure, everybody knows that Queequeg's and Pequod's are rivals.  I don't think that makes it okay to break the law.
10407/0:(gasp)  How can you say that?
10408/0:I don't believe we have anything more to discuss.
10409/0:I never trusted Luminon Saman... yet his rhetoric appeals to a number of our more brash Seekers.
10410/0:Well, I think it's time we all stop taking orders and start thinking for ourselves.
10411/0:You were sincere.
10412/0:If you're trying to enter, you're out of luck.  No admittance without an Arcology passcode.
10413/0:Climate control damaged.  Situation critical. 
10414/0:I can't wait until I'm back inside the arcology's atmospheric barriers.
10415/0:I'm doing what I can, Simon.  I'm having a little trouble convincing customs that it's for an "exhibit".  Give me a few more days.
10416/0:Mmmm.  Too bad.
10417/0:We are so fortunate that Her Holiness found us before Dumier could invade our spirits with such ruthless and selfish competition. 
10418/0:
10419/0:This guy came through, heading that way.
10419/1:A suspicious fellow.  He went that way.
10420/0:This woman came through, heading that way.
10420/1:A suspicious young woman.  She went that way.
10421/0:This woman came through, heading that way.
10421/1:A suspicious young woman.  She went that way.
10422/0:I think I saw the thug.  You might want to check over there.
10422/1:I saw something... or someone.  That way.
10423/0:I think I saw the thug.  You might want to check over there.
10423/1:I saw something... or someone.  That way.
10424/0:I think I heard someone creeping around over there.
10425/0:I think I heard someone creeping around over there.
10426/0:This guy hit me and then took off that way.
10427/0:This guy hit me and then took off that way.
10428/0:It looks like you decided this was the better deal.  Here's the code:  45103.  Now I'm taking off.
10429/0:You shouldn't bring politics into it.  It's a job, not a calling.
10430/0:A woman hit me and then took off that way!
10431/0:Interesting.  Those are contemporary nanomanipulators -- not exactly art-exhibit material.  Check the room for evidence of where they came from or where they might be going.
10432/0:Hey, I'm looking for the Nine Worlds Tavern.  Can you give me directions?
10433/0:The WTO ignored them as some tiny harmless cult.  Apparently they've got more followers than we expected.
10434/0:Change of plans?
10435/0:Are you interested in doing business?
10436/0:Amicably, to be sure.  It's mostly a doctrinal dispute that stands between us.
10437/0:The Order steals our equipment to make us shut down the assembly line.   His church has been doing this for months and we are sick of it.
10438/0:Every voice will be heard -- it won't matter who or where you are.  The stratification of influence will fade away.
10439/0:Just my overactive imagination, it seems.
10439/1:Another guard trying to spook me? 
10440/0:That's what the Order and WTO are fighting over.  Universal biomodification.
10441/0:No thanks.
10442/0:Just my overactive imagination, it seems.
10442/1:Another guard trying to spook me?
10443/0:Crazy what you end up doing sometimes, isn't it?
10444/0:Just an illusion, I guess.
10444/1:Perhaps it's time for a rest, if I'm starting to see things.
10445/0:I guess it could come in handy.  I have some unfinished business in New York.
10446/0:Just an illusion, I guess.
10446/1:Perhaps it's time for a rest, if I'm starting to see things.
10447/0:Don't let yourself become a pawn, Alex.  You can make up your own mind.
10448/0:A woman hit me and then took off that way!
10449/0:I'm fairly certain I saw someone.
10449/1:Well... it's all clear now.
10450/0:Hi.  Name's Alex.
10451/0:I'd look around over there.
10451/1:I'd investigate that area.
10452/0:I'm fairly certain I saw someone.
10452/1:Well... it's all clear now.
10453/0:It's not so much the people as the gobs.  You know, mutants.
10454/0:I'd look around over there.
10454/1:I'd investigate that area.
10455/0:Dreadful racket... but I guess the rascal moved on.
10455/1:Hm. Whomever I heard seems to have slipped away.
10456/0:It took countless hours of negotiations, but we were able to come to an agreement that benefits both organizations' individual members worldwide.  
10457/0:I felt something.  I'd investigate that area.
10458/0:Dreadful racket... but I guess the rascal moved on.
10458/1:Hm.  Whomever I heard seems to have slipped away.
10459/0:I felt something.  I'd investigate that area.
10460/0:All that's left is this little nick.
10460/1:We'll meet again and I'll have my revenge.
10461/0:I will be watching from the sky.  After you find Paul, I will meet you in Flight Bay 23 at the top of the arcology.  Good luck.
10462/0:I don't know what's up with that.
10462/1:I have no idea.
10463/0:All that's left is this little nick.
10463/1:We'll meet again and I'll have my revenge.
10464/0:No loitering.
10465/0:I don't know what's up with that.
10465/1:I have no idea.
10466/0:I'm gonna do this kind of thing when I grow up.  I'm gonna be a pro.
10467/0:Greetings.
10467/1:Good day.
10467/2:Well met.
10468/0:Greetings.
10468/1:Good day.
10468/2:Well met.
10469/0:Thanks.  This isn't much of a reward, but I guess I could give you a medkit.
10470/0:Well met, fellow Templar!
10470/1:Baphomet guide and watch over you.
10471/0:JC and Paul Denton never escaped their original programming.  They instead succeeded only in making copies of themselves.  Without realizing it, they work to build the precise society envisioned by the Illuminati -- and its defunct offshoot, MJ-12.  A population configured for transparency, integration, control... Follow me?
10472/0:JC Denton is ready for your help.  Without you, the procedure cannot work.
10473/0:This has been a pleasing transaction.
10474/0:I found out on my own.
10475/0:I must look like an easy target -- a city official, drinking alone...
10476/0:Like it or not, Alex, we need each other.  It won't be easy for me to forgive your behavior, but I will have to try.  I need you to tell me what you know about the terrorist attack that led to your escape from Tarsus Academy.
10477/0:Chicago was a professional job.  What we've got around here?  A couple of Lowtown gangs and a religious cult.  Purely small-scale operations.
10478/0:We have heard Luminon Saman's call for a return to scripture.  In this shard we read the scripture, the original word of Her Holiness, not what she says for the camera today or tomorrow or two weeks ago.
10479/0:I need to calm down.
10480/0:It seems that the trespasser has fled.
10480/1:The zone seems to be clear now.
10481/0:All I need you to do is finish off JC Denton.  The world doesn't need a new god.
10482/0:It seems that the trespasser has fled.
10482/1:The zone seems to be clear now.
10483/0:It seems this zone is safe and secure again.
10483/1:If that thug is foolhardy enough to return, I'll take care of it.
10483/2:Next time we meet, I'll avenge these assaults.
10484/0:You will need my assistance.
10485/0:It seems this zone is safe and secure again.
10485/1:If that thug is foolhardy enough to return, I'll take care of it.
10485/2:Next time we meet, I'll avenge these assaults.
10486/0:It's me, Alex.
10487/0:Well met, fellow Templar!
10487/1:Baphomet guide and watch over you.
10488/0:A thief?  Not on MY watch.  Ran that troublemaker right out.
10488/1:This zone looks safe from sticky fingers for now.
10489/0:Greetings.
10489/1:Good day.
10489/2:Hello.
10490/0:A thief?  Not on MY watch.  Ran that troublemaker right out.
10490/1:This zone looks safe from sticky fingers for now.
10491/0:Greetings.
10491/1:Good day.
10491/2:Hello.
10492/0:I showed that murderer that the Templars do not suffer bloodthirsty criminals.
10492/1:That's the first wise decision that killer has made -- choosing to flee.
10493/0:Good day, fellow paladin.
10493/1:Baphomet watch over you.
10494/0:I showed that murderer that the Templars do not suffer bloodthirsty criminals.
10494/1:That's the first wise decision that killer has made -- choosing to flee.
10495/0:I've never seen anything like it.
10496/0:Good day, fellow paladin!
10496/1:Baphomet watch over you.
10497/0:I think I just saw something... or someone...
10497/1:Enough of this hide and seek.
10498/0:What do you mean "no comment"?  I saw a man die.  And a code yellow can't be good.
10499/0:I am curious what you will find in the laboratory.  Perhaps Her Holiness has learned something about the Templar plans.
10500/0:What was that all about?
10500/1:Any ideas?
10501/0:I think I just saw something... or someone...
10501/1: Enough of this hide and seek.
10502/0:What was that all about?
10502/1:Any ideas?
10503/0:Your guess is as good as mine.
10503/1:I'm lost.
10504/0:
10504/1:
10504/2:
10504/3:
10505/0:Your guess is as good as mine.
10505/1:I'm lost.
10506/0:Fine.  Get out of here.  But tell your boss I need some weapons, and I need them now.
10507/0:Exactly.
10508/0:I knew I should have joined the union.
10508/1:It's just one of those days, I guess.
10509/0:I'm betting coffee's going to be big once the nanotech boom gets rolling again.
10510/0:Stop bugging me.  People might begin to wonder.
10511/0:I should get back to work.
10512/0:I'm staying here until I'm sure I can make it to the medina without getting shot.
10513/0:Honest.  We really need the money.
10514/0:We will bring you more details as they become available.
10515/0:What a night.
10516/0:Stand ready -- I think I just saw something.
10516/1:We had better be alert now.  We may not be alone.
10517/0:This is your first time in New Cairo?
10518/0:Stand ready -- I think I just saw something.
10518/1:We had better be alert now.  We may not be alone.
10519/0:I'm not blind, you know.
10519/1:Aha!  I see you now!
10520/0:I'm not blind, you know.
10520/1:Aha!  I see you now!
10521/0:I knew I should have joined the union.
10521/1:It's just one of those days, I guess.
10522/0:Stand ready -- it looks like someone's lurking about.
10522/1:What a fool, thinking it's possible to catch Templars unawares.
10523/0:Don't I know it!
10523/1:Definitely.
10524/0:Stand ready -- it looks like someone's lurking about.
10524/1:What a fool, thinking it's possible to catch Templars unawares.
10525/0:Don't I know it!
10525/1:Definitely.
10526/0:What's that I hear?
10526/1:Those noises bode ill.
10527/0:When we have you safe inside another Tarsus facility.  We can no longer protect ourselves in North America.
10528/0:
10528/1:
10528/2:
10528/3:
10529/0: What's that I hear?
10529/1:Those noises bode ill.
10530/0:Anomaly detected.
10530/1:Tracking infrared disturbance.
10531/0:That was a strange noise -- stand ready.
10531/1:Did you hear that?  I wonder what's going on...
10532/0:The Plan has been completed.
10533/0:That's not what he told ME.
10534/0:Anomaly resolved.
10534/1:Zone clear.
10535/0:That was a strange noise -- stand ready.
10535/1:Did you hear that?  I wonder what's going on...
10536/0:Threat identified.
10536/1:Reporting intrusion.
10537/0:The WTO...?  It's not quite that simple.
10538/0:Threat lost.
10538/1:Intruder location unknown.
10538/2:Disturbance out of range.
10539/0:No one -- just an isolated incident.  Listen, we want the trainees to stay in the rec area.  You'll be safe down here.
10540/0:(alarm)
10541/0:(malfunction noises)
10542/0:Coward.
10542/1:Wonder what that's all about.
10542/2:That can't be good.
10543/0:Passengers and patrons should be prepared for delays.
10544/0:He's been watching me for almost a week.  I'm glad he finally took the bait.
10545/0:That's what we're all told when we join -- what you would've been told, eventually, if your training hadn't been interrupted.  It sounds better than the constant bickering and war-mongering between the Order, the WTO, the Templars... all the quasi-Feudal powers that sprang up after the Collapse.
10546/0:Totally.  Right now it's like every city's been divided up by gangs.
10547/0:Pequod's.  They run ads on the public terminal right across the street from my shop, and they don't even have a branch in Trier!
10548/0:Sorry... Sometimes I just don't know when to stop talking.
10549/0:Pequod's Coffee, Arcology Level 107 -- on the edge.
10550/0:I learn more by traveling than sitting on a landing pad.  Where do you want to go?
10551/0:What good are sociopolitical notions to a pilot drone?
10552/0:The ApostleCorp laboratory is underneath the Black Gate.  That's where she is being held.
10553/0:Can't call the moves if you don't have a balanced mind.
10554/0:I think something just bumped me.
10554/1:I just felt something...
10555/0:I think something just bumped me.
10555/1:I just felt something...
10556/0:Ugh!  Coward, taking shots at me from cover...
10556/1:(grunt) I'll not stand for this.
10557/0:Do not think this means all is forgiven.  I just need the credits.
10558/0:Why don't you take care of it?
10559/0:Ugh!  Coward, taking shots at me from cover...
10559/1:(grunt) I'll not stand for this.
10560/0:Autonomous processing interrupted.
10561/0:By Baphomet!
10561/1:Gah!  What is THAT!?
10562/0:Autonomous processing restored.
10563/0:By Baphomet!
10563/1:Gah!  What is THAT!?
10564/0:This club isn't a place to smoke cigars and tell dirty jokes, in case you didn't notice.
10565/0:I'll find the person responsible for this violent attack!
10565/1:There's been a scuffle.
10566/0:I'll find the person responsible for this violent attack!
10566/1:There's been a scuffle.
10567/0:What's this?  Knocked out?
10567/1:Hello?  ... out cold...
10568/0:Anomaly resolved.
10569/0:... go... damage... you are the solution...
10570/0:What's this?  Knocked out?
10570/1:Hello?  ... out cold...
10571/0:Target escaped. 
10572/0:I can't afford the gas grenades now.  Maybe later. [300]
10573/0:(garble garble) error (garble) systems (squeal) error.
10574/0:(buzz) overload (buzz) circuit components (buzz) error.
10575/0:(static) CPU (static) bus failure (static) restoring.
10576/0:You're quite near an imprisoned gray.  Save the poor creature, or the Templars will vivisect him to learn about the grays' vulnerabilities.
10577/0:No amount of nanotech rescripting can change what you were always meant to do.
10578/0:We welcome everyone to transact, but any hostilities will be met with force.
10579/0:So you've been here two weeks.  Any advice?
10580/0:The beacon is currently off-line due to a lack of power.  To contact your pilot, you'll first need to turn on the generator inside the facility.
10581/0:(clears throat)  Need to clean the filter...
10582/0:Calm down.  I think we have a far more serious problem.  I don't think it was one of us who took down the containment fields.  I think they did it themselves...  And I think there is someone, or something, out on the ice now.
10583/0:Sorry.  Never mind.
10584/0:Hi.  I'm NG Resonance.  What would you like to chat about?
10585/0:
10586/0:Instruction set decoded.   Integrating unfamiliar components.  Yes, continue.  Four others.
10587/0:She was a great leader and a great friend.  You completely misunderstand our work.  The Collapse would have been far more devastating if Nicolette and I hadn't accepted her family's legacy and rebuilt the Illuminati organization, which was nearly destroyed by MJ-12.
10588/0:You will appreciate our merchandise.  You may purchase now or earn a discount by providing a service to the Omar.
10589/0:... reading through their mail... heh heh... lots of complaints...
10590/0:Why should I join a group which is at war with itself?
10591/0:Here's some money for a pilot.  [500]
10592/0:I hope you find solace in the next life.
10592/1:Another casualty...
10593/0:I hope you find solace in the next life.
10593/1:Another casualty...
10594/0:A Templar out cold here.
10594/1:I've got to find the fiend responsible for this.
10595/0:A Templar out cold here.
10595/1:I've got to find the fiend responsible for this.
10596/0:We've got to get out of here.  
10597/0:On your toes.  Someone's lurking about, knocking out Templars.
10598/0:Is that what you plan to tell corporate headhunters?  "What the hell?"
10599/0:
10600/0:On your toes.  Someone's lurking about, knocking out Templars.
10601/0:I'll avenge your death, noble one.
10601/1:Another comrade lost...
10602/0:I'll avenge your death, noble one.
10602/1:Another comrade lost...
10603/0:That's arson.
10604/0:Damn that school.
10605/0:If they really did run away, their friends would know where they are, but no one seems to have any idea...  It's kinda got everyone spooked.
10606/0:Most are skeptics, to be sure, but with official sanction we can finally start to make some progress.  Children will grow up seeing us as prominent members of WTO-enclave management.
10607/0:I wish it could be that way, baby.
10608/0:What do you suspect is going on?
10609/0:Once again, good work in Seattle.  The WTO is making good use of the data.  Your next objective: destroy the Nassif family's greenhouse, which is in the northwest corner of the south medina.  The experimental greenhouse, a violation of WTO regulations, should lead us to Dr. Nassif.
10610/0:Huh?
10610/1:Eh?
10610/2:Oh?
10611/0:Catch my show before it's over!  This may be the last time I'm in New Cairo for a long time!
10612/0:They're searching for data that will let them restore the pre-Collapse communications grid.
10613/0:That thing had you eating out of its hand, didn't it?  Their brains have been dissected, you know -- nothing but Cyrillic opcodes.  These cyborgs leech away resources from WTO enclaves as though they're still starving Russian researchers in post-Collapse science cities.
10614/0:A tissue scan, please.  The biological properties could be used to improve Omar adaptability.  Or would you prefer to make a purchase now?
10615/0:When the time comes, we must make the proper remembrances.
10616/0:Do I... know you?  Where's Tong?
10617/0:When the time comes, we must make the proper remembrances.
10618/0:One less freak...
10618/1:Disgusting...  No loss there...
10619/0:I'll just wait here.
10620/0:One less freak...
10620/1:Disgusting...  No loss there...
10621/0:Please -- speak with me.  I can explain what has come to pass.
10622/0:The victims were the parents of Leila Nassif.  This was a deliberate assassination carried out by paramilitaries.
10623/0:What's with these animals?
10623/1:The animals must sense something...
10623/2:Something must be going on...
10624/0:What's with these animals?
10624/1:The animals must sense something...
10624/2:Something must be going on...
10625/0:Look at how upset these animals are.
10626/0:Look at how upset these animals are.
10627/0:I wonder what startled that poor cat.
10628/0:I wonder what startled that poor cat.
10629/0:We can bring the world out of the post-Collapse dark age.
10630/0:Just get the job done.
10631/0:Sorry, there's no layaway plan.
10632/0:There's fifty-two cetasikas, according to the Order Church.  Fifty-two aspects of the mind.  That's a lot of knots to untangle.
10633/0:You will appreciate our merchandise.  You are a welcome customer, having helped us in the past. 
10634/0:That's what the Order and WTO are fighting over.  Universal biomodification.
10635/0:Get back here!
10635/1:Come out and fight!
10635/2:Chicken.
10636/0:They stay down there, we stay up here -- that's the way it should be.
10637/0:Oh hell...
10637/1:What the--!
10637/2:Aaaa!
10638/0:Here we go...
10638/1:That's right, you and me.
10638/2:Too bad for you.
10638/3:Big mistake.
10639/0:It's been ages since I had a real party...
10640/0:Sorry, Alex.
10640/1:Too bad it had to come to this.
10641/0:... got away from me last time.
10641/1:Huh -- a slow learner.
10641/2:NOW you're dead.
10642/0:What kind of person bothers strays like this?
10643/0:
10644/0:Fool.
10644/1:(chuckles) This won't take long.
10645/0:What kind of person bothers strays like this?
10646/0:... just about have you...
10646/1:Steady, steady...
10646/2:Good.  A live target.
10647/0:That cat's on fire!
10648/0:What's that?
10648/1:Hmm?
10649/0:Her Holiness came to Trier to settle this peacefully.
10650/0:What?!
10650/1:Whoa?!
10651/0:Has to be around here somewhere...
10651/1:That trick might work against Standard Security...
10651/2:Huh.  Delaying the inevitable.
10652/0:I think I just saw something...
10653/0:You know, MY vision is modified too... //prolly too much
10653/1:I definitely just saw someone.
10654/0:
10655/0:What was that sound?
10656/0:I just felt something.
10657/0:With your abilities, you will appreciate our merchandise.  You may purchase now or earn an additional discount by providing another service to the Omar.
10658/0:(grunt) Afraid of a fair fight?
10658/1:(grunt) Feeble attack. 
10658/2:(grunt) Coward. 
10659/0:Our message was much simpler in the beginning.
10660/0:You want a lift or not?
10661/0:That don't scare me.  I've been gettin' in trouble since the day I was born.
10662/0:I came across a reference to an... ApostleCorp.  Do they own Tarsus or something?
10663/0:I didn't ask for your help.
10664/0:I might be able to restore your security.
10665/0:You have your orders.
10666/0:I.... believe he understands.
10667/0:All I need you to do is upload the Aquinas specification from the MJ-12 lab underneath UNATCO.  Our scientists will take it from there.
10668/0:I wasn't moping.
10669/0:Figures.
10669/1:You won't get away that easy.
10670/0:Get back here, Chicago.
10670/1:Guess you systems aren't up to the task.
10671/0:The gentleman agreed to abide by our rules.  If there were any illegal dealings --
10672/0:Ha!  Missed!
10672/1:You've got rotten aim.
10672/2:Too quick for ya, huh?
10673/0:(grunt)
10673/1:(grunt)
10674/0:(grunt) My defenses are at least as good as yours...
10674/1:(grunt) Oh yeah?
10675/0:That's strange...
10675/1:Eh?
10676/0:(groan)
10676/1:(groan) I felt that one.
10676/2:(groan) ... getting roughed up a little...
10677/0:I wonder...
10677/1:I've got an odd feeling about this...
10678/0:(groan)
10678/1:(groan) Oh, God...
10679/0:I guess I was just a bit edgy.
10679/1:Must have been my imagination.
10680/0:Normally I'm just a supplier, but with the Summit happening they need a rep who doesn't draw a lot of attention.  Go to the abandoned curio shop above the Nine Worlds Tavern, a place called Der Blutende Rabe.  I'll let the Omar know they should expect a customer.
10681/0:Just doing my job.
10682/0:(groan) I underestimated your systems.
10682/1:(groan) You really gonna kill me, Alex?
10683/0:It must be Alex.
10683/1:One of the children, messing around... heh heh
10684/0:(gasp) (cough)
10685/0:I should check this out.
10685/1:I'm going to take a look around.
10686/0:(scream)
10687/0:Something may be going on here.
10687/1:I don't like this.
10688/0:I'm ready now.
10688/1:You've got my attention.
10689/0:I'm getting to the bottom of this.  Now.
10689/1:I'm short on patience for this sort of thing.
10690/0:My instructions forbid me to say.
10691/0:What!!?
10691/1:Oh -- ?!
10692/0:Thanks for the tip.
10693/0:Need a lift?  [500 credits.]
10694/0:What I really hate are the negative ads, where they say QueeQueg's exploits workers and has germs in its product.
10695/0:Now we'll settle this.
10695/1:You're going to regret messing with me.
10696/0:I guess I can't complain if you aren't charging me.
10697/0:Thanks.  I would think that you and ApostleCorp would be bitter enemies.
10698/0:Helios will communicate, not assimilate.  Life will go on as usual.
10699/0:They can do what they want, I guess.  I can't believe that Tarsus is a front -- after all those years of training.
10700/0:He has been working undercover at the school, with designs on a number of the top students.  Apparently he had orders to murder these children.  Fortunately, his plan was uncovered in time.
10701/0:Your input is appreciated.  Let's talk again!
10702/0:The Omar is not a human organization.  It's a self-replicating machine that grows itself around human bodies.  All we can do is buy time until we have a weapon to defeat the entire network.
10703/0:(groan) My eyes!
10704/0:Ha!  Try again.
10704/1:Barely touched me...
10705/0:(grunt)
10706/0:Explosions -- and a man gets killed -- and they won't give us answers?  How can we possibly trust them?
10707/0:One nanoformer bot, but it's been so long since we've had an emergency that it's fallen apart.  I can't believe someone tried to slip toxic waste past us.
10708/0:I don't know what they've done to me, but with the power you could give him, JC should be able to set it straight.
10709/0:I don't believe it.  (groan)
10710/0:You.... beat me.  (groan)  
10711/0:Back for more?
10711/1:You don't know when to quit.
10712/0:(grunt)
10713/0:You'd best draw your weapon.
10714/0:(gasp)
10715/0:Almost...
10716/0:Gotcha.
10716/1:There.
10717/0:You're an easy target.
10717/1:Good shot, huh?
10717/2:Bullseye.
10718/0:Tag!
10718/1:I bet that smarts.
10719/0:You can't hide forever.
10719/1:Come out and fight.
10720/0:Sure, take out Dumier's commandos on the dock.  [250]
10721/0:Coward.
10721/1:You can't run from me.
10722/0:Give me a sec.
10723/0:Nice shot.
10724/0:I love to talk politics.
10725/0:ugh.
10726/0:(moan)
10727/0:Who knows how far a new biomod architecture could go?  What if mental illness and manic emotional states could be eliminated?  Violent crime might disappear on its own accord.  The dangers of a vast police apparatus might become a thing of the past.
10728/0:I guess those Templars won't be completing their mission.
10729/0:Serious.  Knocked the gob out cold.  She'll be sleeping for hours.
10730/0:Yes.  I love my fans.
10731/0:The bots will see you as an enemy threat -- keep that in mind.
10732/0:You can count on me.
10733/0:I saw the guy -- they've got him in the flight bay.  All this security for a frozen body?  What kind of threat could he be?
10734/0:Do you mind?
10735/0:NG is a spoonfed fool.  She doesn't care who uses her image or for what purpose.
10736/0:Afraid that's the case.  In fact, he hired me to kill you.
10737/0:It's good that you can see reason.  Now go back to your penthouse in the arcology.
10738/0:Huh?
10738/1:Eh?
10738/2:Oh?
10739/0:Too easy.
10739/1:Too bad for you.
10739/2:Ahh, great workout.
10739/3:That was weak.
10740/0:Sorry bastard.
10740/1:Tough luck, chump.
10741/0:Not bad for a girl.
10741/1:Tough luck, honey.
10742/0:You got lucky.
10742/1:Good.  A challenge.
10742/2:Damn.
10743/0:Penthouse.  Nice.
10744/0:Our admiration to all those inside and out of protected enclaves.  Together, we face each uncertain day with resolve and courage.
10745/0:Whiff.
10745/1:Caught some air that time...
10746/0:(moan)
10747/0:Give me a break.
10747/1:Too late.
10747/2:This is good exercise.
10748/0:(grunt) Neurotoxin?
10749/0:The old order is generally recognized as the high point of civilization.  We simply want to revive it.
10750/0:Think you can stand up to me?
10750/1:Your training wasn't nearly as focused as mine.
10750/2:I bet you think your systems are pretty next-gen.
10750/3:Shouldn't of crossed me, Alex.
10751/0:I'm on fire!
10752/0:I checked out the VIP area.  It's a contact point for the Omar, the black market...
10753/0:Just one more...
10753/1:This is too easy.
10754/0:Argh!  I can't see!
10755/0:More details on the Chicago disaster -- As far as we know now, only one bomb was detonated, in a major downtown area, destroying everything within a wide, but as of yet undetermined radius.  
10756/0:Welcome to Club Vox.  We've got the latest NG Resonance sim, the best music, and even a VIP Club for your more private exchanges.  You can pay the cover for the main club here. [100]
10757/0:Sorry it had to end like this, Alex.
10757/1:I'll give you ten seconds to get away... just kidding.
10758/0:Nooo....
10758/1:Not like this...
10758/2:After all I've worked for...
10759/0:The AI was created by MJ-12 to track every electronic transmission on the planet.
10760/0:Denying people their natural-born rights to choose their own artificially-flavored destinies.  Like I said, there's just something wrong with that machine.
10761/0:You must be in town for the summit.
10762/0:THIS is how you honor your elders?
10762/1:You fool.  
10763/0:How much you got?
10764/0:I know all your fancy tricks...
10764/1:Don't expect your abilities to surprise ME.
10765/0:This is way more than I bargained for when I signed on.
10766/0:Mmmmff
10767/0:(grunt)
10768/0:I guess it beats being a pustule-ridden beggar in the medina.
10769/0:(gasp)
10770/0:Gotcha!
10771/0:The Templars STAND for something, you know?  It's ancient, it's philosophy, and it scrip's the paps off all that Her Holiness love an' meditate an' mumble to yourself.
10772/0:
10773/0:You did not betray, like the other.
10774/0:Queequeg's Coffee.  True to the letter means it tastes even better.
10775/0:What do you propose instead?
10776/0:(moan)
10777/0:I'd take the south dock back from the Illuminati.
10778/0:Sign me up.
10779/0:Of course.  It's a simple repair.  I just seem to have left Trier without any multitools.
10780/0:(grunt)
10780/1:(grunt)
10780/2:(grunt)
10781/0:(sigh) Oh, brother...
10781/1:... subsystems still acting up.
10781/2:May as well scan the newsgroups.
10781/3:Hm, better get an upgrade for that...
10781/4:Not again.
10782/0:(yawn)
10782/1:(grrr)
10782/2:(cough)
10782/3:(clears throat)
10782/4:la dee da dee da...
10783/0:Funny.
10783/1:Huh.
10783/2:Watch it.
10784/0:Hands off the merchandise.
10784/1:Hey!
10784/2:This is my space.  Don't violate my space.
10785/0:Hi.  // threatening
10785/1:Want somethin'...?
10785/2:What already?
10786/0:Stop clownin' around.
10786/1:Tryin' to impress somebody?
10786/2:I'd like to know what you think you're doing.
10787/0:I'm supposed to keep this area clear.  You have to go.
10787/1:Better turn around.  Off-limits.
10788/0:
10789/0:You messin' with me?  Are you MESSIN' with me?
10789/1:Try it.
10789/2:Put that away.  Now.
10790/0:We're waiting for reinforcements and our own mech detachment before we move in.  This is way more firepower than we're prepared to deal with, especially with our resources focused at HQ.  But if you can take care of a milbot on your own, be my guest.
10791/0:Make a move, cowboy.
10792/0:Your efforts have succeeded.
10793/0:The villian's MINE!
10794/0:I'm working for the Omar -- you know, the cyborgs.  They're a global operation these days.
10795/0:I checked out the school.  No sign of your daughter, but you should tell her to watch out for the headmaster.  He's only pretending to be a school administrator.
10796/0:You just restored power to the experimental device on the lower level.  Good -- you're thinking ahead.  But you'll have to come back later to bring it online.  We don't know enough about it yet.
10797/0:No worries, hun.  But fair warning -- don't expect a ride back to Seattle.  This town's burned me one too many times.
10798/0:It sure helps having a champ like 'Zilla.  It's our main draw.
10799/0:You did the right thing, my seeker.  Once a destroyer like Dr. Nassif believes she is improving humanity, nothing can save her.  Come.  Hire a pilot at Pequod's coffee shop on Level 107 and help us pick up the trail in Germany.
10800/0:Could be fooling the sensors somehow...
10801/0:Along with the dignity of the species, we will preserve the dignity of the human mind.
10802/0:Let's do this thing.  People are watching.
10803/0:We were having a discussion.  Leave us be.
10804/0:I pulled the grate shut for protection.  How was I to know it was gonna lock behind me?
10805/0:Make a move, cowgirl.
10806/0:May you find what you seek.
10807/0:Real swift.
10807/1:What's the idea?
10807/2:Ha ha.  // sarcastic
10808/0:Cut it out.
10808/1:I'm letting you know.  This is making me mad.
10808/2:Enough already.
10809/0:Don't get chummy.
10809/1:Quit lookin' at me.
10810/0:My records show that that empty wastewater canal connects every building in this district.  Perhaps the local residents know more.  I have been investigating this district myself due to occurrences of my passenger's name in certain communications.
10811/0:Don't pick a fight.
10811/1:Show a little respect, huh?
10811/2:Quit jackin' around.
10812/0:Religious crazies... nothing is good enough for them unless you are praying twenty-fours hours a day.
10813/0:Stand down.  I mean it.
10813/1:I'm not taking this as a joke.  In case you were wondering.
10813/2:You wouldn't stand a chance.
10814/0:Leave or I'll have to do something about it.
10814/1:Time for you to go.
10814/2:I want you to listen to me and get out of here.
10815/0:Now I'm mad.
10815/1:You better listen to me.
10815/2:There are limits.  Okay?  Limits.
10815/3:You think you can ignore me and not get hurt?
10816/0:No more warnings.
10816/1:I'm about to bust you up.
10816/2:Last chance.  You better cool it.
10817/0:I'd take the south dock back from the Illuminati.
10818/0:Yeah.  The big showoff.
10818/1:Just be cool.
10818/2:You freaked me out there.
10819/0:Don't blame ME if you get caught in the crossfire...
10820/0:I need to go to the Rauchstadt area.
10821/0:You lost soul.  With the destruction of Denton's machine, the Templar plan to release a nanite predator into the atmosphere is finished.  Don't expect to leave the island alive.
10822/0:If you want to talk to Miss Sak, fine.  But no snooping around.
10823/0:Yeah...  I saw her in the students' hideout in the ventilation system.
10824/0:I heard that you stopped by the church, Alex.  Don't forget to come see me.  That landing pad is run by a local smuggler, Sophia Sak.  Looks like they've seized Sid Black's harrier -- probably as payment for phony debts.  It never hurts to have a pilot who owes you a favor.  You could pay the debt or -- better -- eliminate Sak and her henchmen for the good of the whole neighborhood.
10825/0:We offer only the finest technologies, even to someone hostile to us in the past.  However, your purchases will be restricted to the highest market prices.
10826/0:Her Holiness first ran into trouble by taking a more moderate line toward scientific research.
10827/0:In time, you will join us.  Of that, I can be certain.  I know every detail of your life.  I was the Project Director of the Tarsus facility in Chicago.
10828/0:No worries if you want to deal with Miss Sak for me.  My lips are sealed.
10829/0:I'm watchin' you, man.  Better take it easy.
10830/0:I'm watchin' you, girl.  Better take it easy.
10831/0:Not now.
10831/1:Hold on a second.
10832/0:Not what I intended...  // regret
10832/1:Oh no... I messed up.
10833/0:Hey.
10833/1:What's up?
10834/0:Hi.
10834/1:Hello.
10834/2:Hey.
10835/0:Dumier has declared you an ally.
10836/0:That way.
10837/0:Sorry -- but if you find anything, come get me.  I'm ready to help.
10837/1:Wish I could help.
10838/0:What's that?
10838/1:Hmmm...
10839/0:That's unusual.
10839/1:I wonder...
10840/0:You mean.... all of this, my business, the competition with Pequod's... it's all some sort of fabrication...?
10841/0:So Eeva WAS right.  
10842/0:
10843/0:
10844/0:(clears throat)  There.  All done!  My compliments.
10845/0:I left Hong Kong in 2052 with instructions to search for JC Denton near Groom Lake in Nevada.  I am an AI construct developed by Tracer Tong.  My instructions were not to stop looking until I was certain that Mr. Denton was safe.
10846/0:Her Holiness is dead.  I killed her because I found out that she and Mr. Dumier are leaders of a secret society called the Illuminati.
10847/0:I'm serious.  I saw the proof in some legal documents I came across in Germany.
10848/0:
10849/0:Be prepared for delays.
10850/0:A co-dominion with the WTO?  Not in my lifetime.
10851/0:Stop looking over my shoulder.  Unless you are one of the secret Evaluators... heh heh
10852/0:Then you won't be getting in.
10853/0:This is JC's habitat.  He came to Antarctica seeking peace.  In turmoil from the merger with the artificial intelligence, Helios, he constructed this place with his mind, using his new power over materials.  The habitat erupted from the landscape, a living technological building, infused with his psyche.
10854/0:
10855/0:Chill out.  We're just passin' through.
10856/0:That didn't look quite right.
10856/1:Huh?  I thought I saw something.
10857/0:And?
10858/0:Strange noises.
10858/1:That didn't sound quite right.
10859/0:There it goes again...
10859/1:This is starting to add up.
10860/0:Hey...
10860/1:What's the deal?
10861/0:I was going to steal one of his expensive paintings.  I guess there's no need for that now.
10862/0:You can't fool me.
10862/1:Nothing I can't handle, I'm sure.
10863/0:Okay, what's going on here?
10863/1:Something's up.
10864/0:I'm going to sort this out.
10864/1:I'm going to get to the bottom of this.
10865/0:Ergh!
10865/1:Wha--?!
10866/0:I guess it was a false alarm.
10866/1:Maybe I'm imagining things?
10866/2:Well, it looks like this area is clear.
10867/0:The trespasser must have fled.
10868/0:The directors of this facility are either dead or captured.  JC was never one of them, but I don't know who was running this lab. There wasn't much communication between the different cells.  
10869/0:Figures they'd ship me to a warzone...
10870/0:I guess we better start inspecting the cargo a bit more closely.
10871/0:Hey you.  C'mere.
10872/0:Where to?  I always charge the going rate. [500]
10873/0:That ain't his name -- it's a Templar title.  Like "private."  Now move your feeb ass.
10874/0:... Helios core... lower platform... nanite-capsid upgrate necessary... all five processing modules... go... lower platform... below...
10875/0:With our technology, we are ready.
10876/0:As for Green Dragon, she's the real thing.  Sewer-born, rat-fed... a hunter, you know.  I'd put my money on Green Dragon.
10877/0:I applied for infusions, but they said my lipids were weak.  I think I should get a second opinion.
10878/0:We welcome the opportunity to do business with you.
10879/0:Order will prevail.  It always does, whether the cause is mystical or merely secular.
10880/0:Time again for a.... ta-a-alk BULLET!
10881/0:I'll take the black market biomod. [500]
10882/0:I'm not looking for a roommate.
10883/0:I guess the thief left.
10884/0:Whoever was attacking people seems to have cleared out.
10885/0:Looks like the murderer took off.
10886/0:Eh?  Did I...? Did I just see something?
10886/1:That looked strange.
10887/0:Whatever pettiness it was, they're all gone now.
10888/0:Not so sneaky, are you?
10888/1:I see you!
10889/0:Our Seekers are securing the building on foot, and we have reprogrammed your security systems to neutralize threats to our cause.
10890/0:What was... that sound?
10890/1:That noise...
10891/0:Order be praised.
10892/0:Huh?  What did I just bump into?
10892/1:I just felt something.
10893/0:Ugh!  That wasn't very nice.
10893/1:Oof!  I've been hit...
10894/0:What... is... THAT?!
10894/1:Eek!
10894/2:Her Holiness protect me!
10895/0:Hey -- it's been damaged!
10896/0:Just a minute.
10897/0:I'm hopin' this will turn into a career in security, if I play my cards right.
10898/0:Or maybe the Omar have an interest in the program that created us, too.  What do they have you doing out here?
10899/0:I see.  So what exactly do you know about this new program?
10900/0:Five years ago, there was a significant shift in Swell 9, but that was caused by el nino.  Most predictors seemed to indicate that all of the nanological clouds were permanent aftereffects from environmental damage done in the wake of The Collapse.  
10901/0:Glad you took care of that.
10902/0:Here you go.  [250 credits.]
10903/0:Glad you took care of that.
10904/0:Glad you took care of that.
10905/0:Glad you took care of that.
10906/0:Glad you took care of that.
10907/0:Glad you took care of that.
10908/0:Hey -- it's been destroyed!
10909/0:Glad you took care of that.
10910/0:Strange... It's been disabled.
10911/0:I guess this room might have a ceiling vent or something, but that won't do ME any good.  I'm claustrophobic.  If you've got a multitool, you might try hacking the control panel next to the beams.  Or disable it with an EMP weapon.  Or -- or something else that might work -- just blow the whole thing up with a grenade.
10912/0:Glad you took care of that.
10913/0:Whoa!  It's gone haywire.
10914/0:My sister-in-law, she's saving up for a bionic eye.  But I guess Piezochem has a monopoly on the surgery, thanks to the WTO, so it's kind of a pipe dream, if you ask me.  The price is set in stone.
10915/0:You're running?!
10916/0:You're running?!
10917/0:I'll let you know how it goes.
10918/0:We still need a lead on Nassif, or we won't know where to send you next.  Double-check the biolab for clues.
10919/0:
10920/0:Dr. Nassif is up ahead.  You're being used, Alex.  All the WTO wants is to steal her research and clone their own lab specimens.  The wisest alternative is to kill her before she can be interrogated.
10921/0:Wait a sec -- how did THAT happen?
10922/0:Hmph.  It's missing.
10923/0:Hmph.  That's not where it's supposed to be.
10924/0:I think the city's settling back down.
10925/0:Shhh.  I'm talkin' about the Champ, Gob-zilla.  Follow me?  She's still at Tina's pad in the Heron's Loft building near the Inclinator.  Apartment 22.  I'll give you a bounty if that gob dies [100 credits], plus you get to make bank on the four-to-one situation.  Cool?
10926/0:
10927/0:The Templars have the arcology locked down and have removed the pilot beacon so we can't even call for an airlift out of here.  
10928/0:No problem.
10929/0:And that's why you killed Her Holiness, the spiritual leader of half the world?
10930/0:Why are you hiding out back here?  
10931/0:This has been a long week.
10932/0:You're running?!
10933/0:You're running?!
10934/0:Another thrill-packed afternoon, huh?
10935/0:You are running?!
10936/0:You're running?!
10937/0:I guess I shouldn't be saying any of this -- they don't even know if they can trust you.
10938/0:You're running?!
10939/0:Dumier has declared you an ally.
10940/0:Welcome to New Cairo.  Remember: a visitation pass is a privilege.  Don't abuse it.
10941/0:You're running?!
10942/0:I said tell it to the Chief.
10943/0:I have enough worries just getting profitable.  The Regional Director is reviewing my books at the end of the week.  My only enemy is Pequod's, and our battlefield is the customer.
10944/0:You're running?!
10945/0:You will close Club Vox until further notice.  Section 876, Transhuman Immigration Violation.
10946/0:You're running?!
10947/0:You're running?!
10948/0:No problem, except I'm broke.  Just let me run to the ATM first.
10949/0:She was quite a lady about it, actually.  I have everything I need.
10950/0:You're running?!
10951/0:Someone in the village, but the Templar command is in the arcology.  They have a recruiting kiosk there.  We can't move people into New Cairo too easily.
10952/0:Dr. Nassif was telling the truth.  I'm a clone of JC Denton.
10953/0:Now my technicians can be certain of our counter-nanite.  Come to New York, young Knight.  We have work to do.  Your pilot will have to meet you in Flight Bay 23 because my people cannot be interrupted.
10954/0:We're pretty sure there are Templars in the apartment upstairs, here to threaten my family.
10955/0:Thanks.  I guess my eyes gave me away...
10956/0:The WTO...?  It's not quite that simple.
10957/0:Got fired.  Again.  Time to start drinkin'.
10958/0:We sure taught him a lesson.
10959/0:I'm tired of waiting.  The time for patience has passed.  Now it is time for action.
10960/0:I was in on a consultation.  That sucker they built shoots through walls!  I'm supposed to keep an eye on the ecological impacts -- and not go too close to the rear of the complex.
10961/0:Heya.
10961/1:All clear.
10961/2:Just takin' it one day at a time.
10962/0:No need for a bloodbath.  Let's sneak past.
10963/0:Lookin' for a sure thing?  She's right under the grate there.  Check out the scales on that girl!  That's Green Dragon, a new gob fresh from the sewer.  Mean as nails.
10964/0:You've tampered with your DNA, but I know that wearing this suit won't mean my kids are born with horns and tail.
10965/0:Now prove your sincerity.  Give my scientists what they need.
10966/0:Wha-what's wrong with that bot?
10966/1:Aieeee!  That bot's trying to kill me!
10967/0:Be aware that any infractions will be met with maximum force allowable by Trier law.  
10968/0:Welcome.
10969/0:You're gonna regret doing that..!
10969/1:Die, killer!  Die!
10969/2:(growl) You twisted, sadististic, worthless.... y-you're dead!
10970/0:Much change and choice in the coming hours.
10971/0:I'll keep all of that in mind.
10972/0:My orders encompass that contingency as well.
10973/0:I'll take that as a slap in the face.  Don't be a fool, Alex.  Do you really think that the Dentons will have any use for you once their technology is imposed on humanity?  It will be a nanite plague worse than the one in Cairo, and you will be responsible.
10974/0:Lemme know how it goes with Miss Sak.
10975/0:
10976/0:I hope you have a good time.
10977/0:Your interruptions are keeping me from my patients.
10978/0:The man can pick his gobs...
10979/0:I'm not fallin' for a fool-ass play like that.
10980/0:Go on about your business.
10981/0:Help!
10982/0:Who next?
10983/0:Help!
10984/0:Help!
10985/0:We offer only the finest technologies.
10986/0:Help!
10987/0:What do you mean "no comment"?  We're under attack!
10988/0:Help!
10989/0:Too bad it won't clean up the rest of this place.
10990/0:Help!
10991/0:What's going on here?
10992/0:We'll dispatch a crew to resolve the situation immediately.  Thanks for the tip.  You're entitled to an informant's reward, if you're interested.
10993/0:Help!
10994/0:Help!
10995/0:I don't know you, so leave me alone.
10996/0:That's why I joined up.  In case there's a way to turn things around.
10997/0:Thanks.  I'm glad I didn't have to deal with it.  I hope the director is paying you a fair wage, but in case she isn't, you might want to check out the repair bot storage closet if you haven't already.  The code's 13490.  Grab whatever you need.  You earned it.
10998/0:Alex, I'm afraid something happened in Chicago -- a terrorist attack.  We evacuated you and Billie just in time.
10999/0:They were eliminated.  SSC stormed the arcology with forces flown in from Germany, but they were surrounded and are now pinned down somewhere inside the structure.
11000/0:This is a pretty exclusive building, so of course we've got the best security Upper Seattle money can buy.
11001/0:Oh, please.  Just take me back downtown.
11002/0:Jamila thinks maybe Eeva and Jennifer were thrown out, but I don't believe it.
11003/0:Probably just more demolition.  That's Upper Seattle, you know, always growing....  We hear it all the time.  Hey, you must be overwhelmed.  I mean -- Chicago, the whole city.  Was your family from there?
11004/0:Kill him, you fool!
11005/0:Alex!  What are you doing?  You shouldn't be nosing through classified SSC material.  Don't tell me that fool who runs the coffeeshop put you up to this.  His lawsuit is pending.  That's all he needs to know.
11006/0:Don't tell me you're one of those paranoid secret-society types.
11007/0:Help!
11008/0:Help!
11009/0:Help!
11010/0:A member of the Order.  Are you with the summit?
11011/0:Help!
11012/0:Saw monsters dropping out of the attic in that alcove!
11013/0:Right away.
11013/1:I'm on my way.
11014/0:Right away.
11014/1:I'm on my way.
11015/0:Right away.
11015/1:I'm on my way.
11016/0:Right away.
11016/1:I'm on my way.
11017/0:May Her Holiness watch over you.
11018/0:I am on my way.
11018/1:Right away.
11019/0:I don't know who paid you to kill Her Holiness, but you better hope they know how to get you out of Trier alive.
11020/0:Right away.
11020/1:I'm on my way.
11021/0:Aw, jeez, he's doin' it again...
11022/0:Find the Aquinas specification, upload it to our scientists, then neutralize J.C. Denton and destroy his machine.  The world doesn't need any new gods.
11023/0:So?
11024/0:To be certain.
11025/0:This kidnapping has had a grave effect on Chairman Dumier.
11026/0:(sigh) These poor people...
11027/0:
11028/0:Honest.  We really need the money.
11029/0:
11030/0:Fortunately we have visionaries like Her Holiness to guide our way.
11031/0:I saw one of your troopers killed and now this place is being stormed!  What's going on?!
11032/0:Be careful of the other trainees.  They won't necessarily see things the way you do.
11033/0:I don't understand.  I thought Kurczec had Trier in his back pocket.  I knew him on Wall Street before the Collapse.
11034/0:You're listed as the investigator who opened a criminal probe into Tarsus Academy.
11035/0:This plague is all I've ever known, and I get sick so easily.
11036/0:Right away.
11036/1:I'm on my way.
11037/0:Right away.
11037/1:I'm on my way.
11038/0:A helicopter followed you here.  Tracer Tong sent it to pick me up from Area 51 after my infiltration of MJ-12.  Ava Johnson was the pilot, an AI construct.  I'm putting her at your disposal.  Go back to the surface and activate the pilot beacon at the abandoned VersaLife base so that she will know where to land.
11039/0:Right away.
11039/1:I'm on my way.
11040/0:That's the man whose penthouse you broke into -- Upper Seattle's Minister of Culture.  Not much use talking to him at this point -- you already have access to his place.
11041/0:Your work will not be forgotten.  When millions of Templars march to victory, you and your team will share in our triumph over the impure.
11042/0:Right away.
11042/1:I'm on my way.
11043/0:We'll talk again...
11044/0:Right away.
11044/1:I'm on my way.
11045/0:Then why am I sick?  I exercise, eat right, I always wear my breather when I'm out in the medina...
11046/0:Right away.
11046/1:I'm on my way.
11047/0:Ah yes.  He told me you were coming.  The door code is 23489.
11048/0:Ummm... Let's talk about this when there's no one around.
11049/0:This is what you've signed on for -- bloody mercenary work for the Templars?   I thought you were better than that, Billie.
11050/0:Ummm... Let's talk about this when there's no one around.
11051/0:Ummm... Let's talk about this when there's no one around.
11052/0:Ummm... Let's talk about this when there's no one around.
11053/0:Thanks.
11054/0:Stop hangin' around me.  People are gonna notice.
11055/0:You have undone her trap.
11056/0:So, Alex, I thought you should know.  I did some asking around.  No one knew who sent you to New Cairo, but I started getting this news out of New York.  And now I find out that that's where you're headed.
11057/0:Why do you persist?  Tong, Dumier, Her Holiness -- they're all fools.  Do you really understand what they're asking you to do?  Go to Tent 04 and I'll contact you there.
11058/0:A big show to distract everyone from the fact that the system is broken -- both the Order and WTO.  I filed a lawsuit under both jurisdictions, and all it's done is sit in a drawer somewhere.
11059/0:
11060/0:I don't think that's where it should be.
11061/0:I don't think that's where it should be.
11062/0:What does ApostleCorp need creatures like you for?
11063/0:I don't think that's where it should be.
11064/0:I don't think that's where it should be.
11065/0:What about the press?  The added security?
11066/0:Ummm... Let's talk about this when there's no one around.
11067/0:I don't think that's where it should be.
11068/0:Ummm... Let's talk about this when there's no one around.
11069/0:I don't think that's where it should be.
11070/0:Damn it!  I'll stop you myself.
11071/0:Ummm... Let's talk about this when there's no one around.
11072/0:I don't think that's where it should be.
11073/0:Ummm... Let's talk about this when there's no one around.
11074/0:I don't think that's where it should be.
11075/0:That landing pad is run by a local smuggler, Sophia Sak.  Looks like they seized Sid Black's harrier -- probably as payment for phony debts.  It never hurts to have a pilot who owes you a favor.  You could pay the debt or -- better -- eliminate Sak and her henchmen for the good of the whole neighborhood.
11076/0:Ummm... Let's talk about this when there's no one around.
11077/0:That took a beating.
11078/0:You've gotten past the checkpoint.  Good.  Now forget everything those troopers just said.  I trust the WTO about as much as I now trust Tarsus.  If you need further proof of the program's duplicity, you should stop by Nassif's apartment.  I got the address when I broke into her office -- Apartment 2224, Emerald Suites.  I'm transmitting a map of the complex to you now.
11079/0:If you don't talk to them, who will?  Don't let your son or daughter fall prey to this disturbing trend.
11080/0:Ummm... Let's talk about this when there's no one around.
11081/0:That took a beating.
11082/0:So?
11083/0:Ummm... Let's talk about this when there's no one around.
11084/0:Ummm... Let's talk about this when there's no one around.
11085/0:Yes.  Missionaries.
11086/0:Thanks.
11087/0:I will never get anywhere at this rate...
11087/1:So much corruption...
11087/2:I wonder if she noticed that the cuffs are frayed...?
11087/3:Can't even afford to buy a sandwich at these prices...
11087/4:These shoes are almost worn through...
11087/5:I never get a break.
11087/6:The fortune teller was just fishing for a big tip when he said I would be rich...
11087/7:Greasels in the medina!  What next?
11087/8:Just have to take it as it comes...
11088/0:Advance?
11089/0:Someday I'm going to travel.
11089/1:I never thought of myself as a good dresser.
11089/2:I love the sunsets here.
11089/3:That's no way to live...
11089/4:Everything is changing so fast...
11089/5:The government should never have gotten involved...
11089/6:I've never HEARD such a horrible cough...
11090/0:Maybe it IS a judgment on us...
11091/0:
11092/0:Filthy Seekers.
11093/0:Are you the specialist?  We've been waiting for hours for someone to solve the greasel situation.
11094/0:The Chicago disaster is occupying every available craft.  You shouldn't have any trouble finding a pilot at the Greasel Pit Bar in Lower Seattle.  I don't care who flies you in, just get there.  Mako is developing a new firearm called the Mag Rail.  In addition to finding Nassif, the WTO needs an agent who can get us the Mag Rail schematic.  I hope that will be you, Alex.
11095/0:Wish I could help.
11096/0:You wouldn't fall for something like that.
11097/0:What is this place?
11098/0:Well done.  Order is with us.
11099/0:
11100/0:You really round up freaks and murder them?
11101/0:That took a beating.
11102/0:Better look again.  They did the same thing to me during summer recon.  I got a perfect score because I kept my cool.
11103/0:That took a beating.
11104/0:That took a beating.
11105/0:That took a beating.
11106/0:...I wonder...
11107/0:That took a beating.
11108/0:...I wonder...
11108/1:I think I might be coming down with something.
11109/0:That took a beating.
11110/0:Someday they will learn...
11110/1:They can hire all the police they want, and it won't do any good.
11110/2:... turning into a three-ring circus.
11110/3:A lousy excuse for starkbier...
11110/4:I will have to stop by the gun shop...
11111/0:That took a beating.
11112/0:...I wonder...
11113/0:That took a beating.
11114/0:...I wonder...
11115/0:That took a beating.
11116/0:It's a decent crowd tonight.
11117/0:...I wonder...
11117/1:I think I might be coming down with something.
11118/0:That took a beating.
11119/0:Wonder if she remembers me...
11119/1:I wish she'd call...
11119/2:Happy hour -- here I come.
11119/3:Same old thing.
11119/4:Things are getting weirder all the time...
11119/5:I wish I'd listened...
11119/6:Lookin' good.
11119/7:I need a beer.
11119/8:Twenty years since the Collapse, and still no one can make a decent electric razor.
11119/9:Need to pick up more cologne...
11120/0:What's an Omar doing in the heart of Upper Seattle?
11121/0:Never a dull moment.
11121/1:I should have stayed in school...
11121/2:Fun fun fun.
11121/3:My mother was right.
11121/4:Polka dots - what's her problem with polka dots?
11121/5:I forgot her birthday again...
11121/6:My toe hurts.
11121/7:Maybe I should get a dog...
11121/8:I must have bad breath...
11121/9:Gotta stop talking to myself...
11122/0:...I wonder...
11122/1:I think I might be coming down with something.
11123/0:I wonder how I'd look in orange...
11123/1:Maybe I should get a cat...
11123/2:I hate what this humidity does to my hair.
11123/3:My sister was right.
11123/4:At least I'm getting exercise.
11123/5:I should have skipped that second soy bar...
11123/6:I shouldn't have stayed up so late... (yawn)
11123/7:It's all his fault.
11123/8:Who SAYS I'm a bad dancer?
11123/9:No more wine at lunch.
11124/0:You reconsidered.  Good.  Come to the -- Wait!  Must be an overload... or a self-destruct sequence.  A blast door just sealed off the only exit.  You'll be trapped unless you can kill the power with the control box on the south wall -- or destroy the exposed conduits.  I should've known old Alex Jacobson would have a surprise waiting for unauthorised users...
11125/0:
11126/0:Oh well.  The superior product will have to prevail over glitz and subterfuge.
11127/0:You have a purpose.
11128/0:We have been instructed to let you pass.
11129/0:Hi there, foxy.
11130/0:They're all frothy and swirly.
11131/0:The bookie's got your money.
11132/0:Upset enough to run away?
11133/0:Someday you will liberate yourself from Tarsus's conditioning.
11134/0:I'm just a fan.
11135/0:You uptown feebs sure like to talk.
11136/0:We were friends.  Now he's... gone.  This is crazy.
11137/0:That's why you refuse to support companies like QueeQueg's Coffee, which cut costs by exploiting poor bean growers.
11138/0:I know what you mean.  I got the same routine too.
11139/0:Wow -- someone destroyed that.
11140/0:My problem was that I never had any conviction.  I always needed someone to encourage me.
11141/0:Wow -- someone destroyed that.
11142/0:Wow -- someone destroyed that.
11143/0:Wow -- someone destroyed that.
11144/0:Would you like to buy a can?  Special price -- today only.
11145/0:Too dangerous!
11145/1:Can't talk now!
11146/0:Ach -- someone destroyed that.
11147/0:Just let her go, Red.
11148/0:Too dangerous!
11148/1:Can't talk now!
11149/0:Wow -- someone destroyed that.
11150/0:That's the main entrance.  You'll either need the access code or explosives to get inside.
11151/0:
11152/0:Too dangerous!
11152/1:Can't talk now!
11153/0:Wow -- someone destroyed that.
11154/0:The charges are pure fabrications -- it doesn't matter.  The lawyer is one Kevin O'Rourke. He lives in Suite 2226.  To be blunt, I want him dead.
11155/0:Too dangerous!
11155/1:Can't talk now!
11156/0:Wow -- someone destroyed that.
11157/0:Too dangerous!
11157/1:Cannot talk now!
11158/0:Wow -- someone destroyed that.
11159/0:Too dangerous!
11159/1:Can't talk now!
11160/0:Wow -- someone destroyed that.
11161/0:Too dangerous!
11161/1:Can't talk now!
11162/0:Too dangerous!
11162/1:Can't talk now!
11163/0:Too dangerous!
11163/1:Can't talk now!
11164/0:ApostleCorp is not in the weapons business.  Our people here control the biolab -- that's it.  We've been investigating the Mag Rail project ourselves, because it looks like Mako is gearing up for a large arms shipment.  Five hundred thousand units.  We think the guns are headed for the Knights Templar.
11165/0:No thanks.
11166/0:Too dangerous!
11166/1:Can't talk now!
11167/0:Your people exterminate these guys like they're a pack of greasels.
11168/0:
11169/0:Out of my way.
11170/0:I'm sure you'll put your purchase to good use.  heh heh
11171/0:
11172/0:
11173/0:Every subject has a different reaction when he or she learns the truth.
11174/0:
11174/1:
11174/2:
11175/0:Wow -- someone destroyed that.
11176/0:Wow -- someone destroyed that.
11177/0:I'm calling security!
11178/0:Oh great -- it's malfunctioning.
11179/0:Want my opinion?
11180/0:Oh great -- it's malfunctioning.
11181/0:Too dangerous!
11181/1:Can't talk now!
11182/0:Oh great -- it's malfunctioning.
11183/0:Too dangerous!
11183/1:Can't talk now!
11184/0:Oh great -- it's malfunctioning.
11185/0:I'm under strict orders not to discuss our work.
11186/0:He informed me.  The WTO Chairman is in the interrogation room upstairs.  Don't worry -- no one's going to get interrogated.  Just a safety precaution.
11187/0:It was an accident...
11188/0:Oh great -- it's malfunctioning.
11189/0:It was an accident...
11190/0:Oh great -- it's malfunctioning.
11191/0:It was an accident...
11192/0:Oh great -- it's malfunctioning.
11193/0:Nice move.  That was the nanoformer bot, not a threat.  Now the hazard flush system is the only way to clean this up.  You also could just try powering up the system from the Director's office, but then you'd have to brave the cloud to get to the keypad to activate the Inclinator itself.
11194/0:Yeah?
11195/0:It was an accident...
11196/0:Oh great -- it's malfunctioning.
11197/0:It was an accident...
11198/0:Honey?
11199/0:It was an accident...
11200/0:The Order needs all the information you can find   Look around for some details about what they were talking about.
11201/0:This is a private laboratory.  State your business.
11202/0:It was an accident...
11203/0:It was an accident...
11204/0:Or maybe it was just a new flavor the vendor was trying to push.
11205/0:Looks like you came across a maintenance building.  Maybe you can learn something from one of the civilian employees inside.
11206/0:Someday, they will awaken.
11207/0:...I think they were kicked out.  They disappeared right after the last biochem exam.  Maybe they were expelled for cheating?  That would explain why they were getting such high grades... 
11208/0:Excellent.  My technicians on Ophelia are already configuring the first operational Aquinas Hub in a generation... one which is in orbit and safe from tampering.  Now make sure that both Denton brothers are neutralized.
11209/0:You seem pretty calm.  Considering what's been going on, I would expect most of the students to be a litte nervous.
11210/0:The repairs will be simple -- nothing more serious than a bad radiator hose.
11211/0:That was a joke.  Seekers can make jokes, can't they?
11212/0:The failure in this case of the aerostat perimeter doesn't --
11213/0:Well, show up in New York and maybe you can help me sort all of this out.
11214/0:In a short time, the SSC will be put to the test on the international stage.  Tension in Trier right now is building, as members of both organizations flow into a city already exhausted by conflict.
11215/0:So.  You want to hammer us back into the Dark Ages?  Don't think I'm going to ignore a threat to the world I brought back from ashes.  I'm sending in some commandos.  If somehow you survive, more will be waiting for you on Liberty Island -- and so will I!
11216/0:Oh great -- it's malfunctioning.
11217/0:I can't stand being trapped like this.  I want to DO something.
11218/0:Oh great -- it's malfunctioning.
11219/0:Oh great -- it's malfunctioning.
11220/0:Oh great -- it's malfunctioning.
11221/0:Sorry, I don't have that kind of money. [200]
11222/0:What a day.
11223/0:Someone must've powered this down.
11224/0:Someone must've powered this down.
11225/0:My priorities are survival and infiltration at any cost.  Enough talk.  I am here to assist.
11226/0:Someone must've powered this down.
11227/0:At least I got you moving.  The Leo Jankowski I met in Seattle doesn't stand around moping about his problems.
11228/0:Too late.  She already gave away the nature of ApostleCorp's secret invention.  You can be sure the WTO won't rest until they have teleportation devices of their own -- and a worldwide monopoly on their manufacture.
11229/0:Someone must've powered this down.
11230/0:Someone must've powered this down.
11231/0:It was unwise to trust the safety of Her Holiness to WTO security.
11232/0:Someone must've powered this down.
11233/0:Get me out of here!
11234/0:What were you doing in there?
11235/0:Sure, make it into a snipe hunt... give him a flashlight and a dog whistle and send him into the medina...
11236/0:Until your older brother, JC, broke up their network and in the process caused the world economic collapse.  When you were five, ApostleCorp moved you and your foster parents to Chicago.
11237/0:Is this a sales pitch?  Why don't you get to the punchline.
11238/0:If you're ready to head out, just exit the area.  The unlock weapons scan will automatically reactivate everything.
11239/0:Thanks.
11240/0:
11241/0:Good for you guys.
11242/0:Do not concern yourself with my safety.
11243/0:The other key is already here.  It is time to awaken JC, but we fear she is here to prevent it and to harm him.  You must stop her and you must revive him.
11244/0:What would this "pure democracy" look like?
11245/0:At least one trainee besides me reported to the authorities.  Have you seen Leo?
11246/0:SSC authorities are not sure whether he has been abducted or whether he is responsible in some way for the deaths.  The investigation continues...
11247/0:Someone must've powered this down.
11248/0:I don't know if I'll need to testify.  I talked to the Chairman.  We discussed regime change for New Cairo.
11249/0:Someone must've powered this down.
11250/0:Someone must've powered this down.
11251/0:Luminon Saman inspires a greater devotion among some members, which is a wonderful effect, I guess...
11252/0:First Her Holiness gets taken -- then found-- what a day!
11253/0:Someone must've powered this down.
11254/0:Someone must've powered this down.
11255/0:Someone must've powered this down.
11256/0:Not one Omar will escape.  This will be the end of their presence in Cairo.
11257/0:Now why is this open?
11258/0:Now why is this open?
11259/0:
11260/0:Now why is this open?
11261/0:Now why is this open?
11262/0:This is bioinformatics.  We aren't expecting any visitors.
11263/0:Sure you want to get dropped at Liberty Island?  I heard the place is haunted.
11264/0:Yea-ah... Green Dragon.  I put my money on sewer-gobs every time.  They're meaner.  How much you wanna bet?
11265/0:Most cities are begging to be incorporated.  
11266/0:Thank you.  I'd almost given up hope.  This morning some Templar fanatic murdered my daughter Mina along with a dozen other students.  It was her first day at the Tarsus school.  Don't blame yourself for getting her admitted -- you made us so happy.  Oh!  (sob)  I can't believe it!  I was on my way to claim the body when the Templars attacked the mosque.
11267/0:That's why we're under lockdown and curfew now.  Trying to stamp out the last bits of the Panzerwerks riot.
11268/0:The next stage draws near.
11269/0:I already put down the money for Sid Black, the Harrier pilot.
11270/0:Having grown up poor, I appreciated the Tarsus school, and when ApostleCorp came to me and said they wanted to get rid of the enclave-mentality that keeps the rich behind walls and the poor -- like my relatives in the medina -- scrabbling in the dirt -- I couldn't refuse.
11271/0:The students are fortunate that Archer's plans were uncovered... but my family is far from safe.
11272/0:But -- I was wondering -- does the real NG ever see these conversations -- like, watch recordings or anything?
11273/0:Finish off the Denton brothers and step into their machine.  My scientists will modify your nanite architecture into a delivery vehicle for our cellular defense mechanism.
11274/0:Now why is this open?
11275/0:Now why is this open?
11276/0:Maybe it's just a drill.
11277/0:Now why is this open?
11278/0:Now why is this open?
11279/0:They were eliminated.  SSC stormed the arcology with forces flown in from Germany, but they were surrounded and are now pinned down somewhere inside the structure.
11280/0:Now why is this open?
11281/0:Now why is this open?
11282/0:It's the same message over and over, yet I can't pull myself away.
11283/0:Now why is this open?
11284/0:Now why is this open?
11285/0:Shouldn't this be open?
11286/0:Shouldn't this be open?
11287/0:Wish I could help.  If you have a problem with the new policies, talk to someone at the SSC station across the square.
11288/0:I think you're lying.
11289/0:When you drink a cup of coffee, you drink Pequod's, because Pequod's is a pioneer of the new economy: efficient, modern, clean...
11290/0:(buzz) error (grinding) error (buzz)
11291/0:The only honest form of government is one that responds to the opinions of the people every second of the day.
11292/0:I'm not afraid to.
11293/0:Need additional ammunitition.
11293/1:Ammunition depleted.
11294/0:Security template replaced.
11295/0:Systems need repair.
11296/0:It doesn't sound so hard to write novels.  I could figure it out if I had the time.
11297/0:Don't DO this, Alex!  
11298/0:Targeting...
11299/0:Summoning mobile unit.
11299/1:Armored security platform requested.
11300/0:Summoning mobile repair station.
11301/0:The woman you call Her Holiness is the daughter of the Illuminatus Beth DuClare.  She founded the Church after the Collapse as a foothold to regaining power.
11302/0:I could use the firepower of an SMG, but I'm short on cash.  [400]
11303/0:Just another day at the Pit.
11304/0:Sometimes I wonder why I should care what happens to me anymore, after what they did to my daughter Eeva at that school.
11305/0:Well... to tell you the truth, I was leading up to hiring you.  I don't mind paying for a job like that.
11306/0:I am ready to fight on the front lines and if necessary be imprisoned for my faith.
11307/0:Shouldn't this be open?
11308/0:I'll take it from here, thanks.
11309/0:Shouldn't this be open?
11310/0:Shouldn't this be open?
11311/0:Shouldn't this be open?
11312/0:Shouldn't this be open?
11313/0:Shouldn't this be open?
11314/0:Shouldn't this be open?
11315/0:There is, friend.  Join our order.  We work to reverse and eliminate corruption.
11316/0:Shouldn't this be open?
11317/0:Shouldn't this be open?
11318/0:Shouldn't this be open?
11319/0:So how does it feel?  Your life's work is a phony conflict between business and idealism in the minds of billions of people.
11320/0:We didn't know.  Who would think that the air could eventually kill you?
11321/0:I'm not looking for a roommate.
11322/0:Vmail sender replied:
11323/0:Line of sight obstructed.
11324/0:Enemy deterred.
11324/1:Target leaving zone.
11325/0:Enemy returning fire.
11325/1:Incoming attacks indicate inferior targeting ability.
11326/0:She moves to destroy JC.  We do not understand this violence against her own kind.
11327/0:Enemy augmentation identified.
11328/0:Damage sustained.
11328/1:System damage manageable.  Continuing.
11329/0:I'm certain.  Fortunately, I got there in time.
11330/0:System disruption significant.
11330/1:Damage severe.  Engaging auxillary components.
11331/0:JC Denton did what the Illuminati asked -- he destroyed Bob Page, the leader of MJ-12.  Don't be tricked into believing that the Helios-JC hybrid is true to JC.  It might have its own agenda, one driven by a well-disguised machine intelligence.
11332/0:Let the Order into your heart and learn another way.  We were meant to believe, to aspire -- yes, aspire...
11333/0:Systems failing.
11333/1:Mechanical vulnerability high.
11334/0:Then you are barred from entry.
11335/0:Negligible damage.
11335/1:Enemy ineffective.
11336/0:
11337/0:Ever since the Collapse, the whole world's a Pit, except instead of gobs it's cults.  WTO, Order, Omar, Templars -- they're all the same.
11338/0:Trouble?  TROUBLE?  Not at all -- unless you count canceling a major concert, getting trapped in a war zone, and practically starving to death without even a number to call for room service.
11339/0:That should be off.
11340/0:Sorry to hear that.
11341/0:That should be off.
11342/0:You don't look like you're from around here.
11343/0:That should be off.
11344/0:That should be off.
11345/0:I grew up in Old Chicago, not some cozy enclave.  My parents made it clear I was gonna have to make it on my own.  When I got picked for the covert ops program, I figured what the hell.
11346/0:That should be off.
11347/0:That should be off.
11348/0:They better not hurt that woman.  Mark my words.
11349/0:Making weapons for a bunch of Renaissance-fair types wasn't my first choice of profession -- but jobs are pretty scarce these days.
11350/0:Free this one.
11351/0:That should be off.
11352/0:That should be off.
11353/0:That should be off.
11354/0:That should be off.
11355/0:I don't know who you are and I don't care.
11356/0:I think you're lying.
11357/0:I need you to stay right here.
11358/0:I bet I know who engineered the spill, just from the look he gave me.
11359/0:You're pretty friendly for a rich kid.
11360/0:Fire damage.
11361/0:Targeting ability disrupted.
11362/0:Good work.  Now I will take action.
11363/0:Success.
11363/1:Target weakened.
11364/0:Target eliminated.
11364/1:Requesting cleanup.
11364/2:Successful engagement logged for analysis.
11364/3:Firing-lane cleared.
11364/4:Security measures successful.
11365/0:Failure.
11365/1:Target unharmed.  Analyzing...
11365/2:Reviewing targeting error.
11366/0:Beware: automated security in place.
11366/1:Turn back.  Unauthorized personnel presumed to be hostile.
11366/2:The violator is advised to leave immediately.
11366/3:This area is protected.
11366/4:You have been identified as a threat.  Access denied.
11367/0:Threat elimination likely.
11367/1:Success anticipated.
11367/2:Deterrence unsuccessful.  Proceeding with termination.
11367/3:Trespassers will be held responsible for any medical expenses related to their injuries.
11368/0:We appreciate your resourcefulness in seeking us out.
11369/0:Success imminent.
11369/1:Zone almost clear.
11369/2:Finishing the engagement.
11369/3:Threat is containable.
11370/0:Combat in this sector evenly matched.  Searching for advantage.
11370/1:Analyzing persistent threat.
11370/2:Threat is substantial.
11371/0:Credible danger identified.  Maximum response necessary.
11371/1:Response effectiveness deteriorating.
11371/2:Defense forces may be inadequate.
11371/3:Threat difficult to contain.
11372/0:I'm just one man....  I -- I --
11373/0:I better know a lot more than that if my code is going to be regulating protein synthesis in the cells of your body.
11374/0:That should be off.
11375/0:That should be off.
11376/0:Shouldn't this be on?
11377/0:HEY -- I'll ask the questions here.  You're thugs, and innocent people --
11378/0:Shouldn't this be on?
11379/0:Alex, I'm on the north dock.  Come see me.
11380/0:Shouldn't this be on?
11381/0:Shouldn't this be on?
11382/0:Shouldn't this be on?
11383/0:Shouldn't this be on?
11384/0:Shouldn't this be on?
11385/0:Mako Ballistics is honeycombed with small research teams like ours -- tentacles of outside corporations, seeds of new ones, internal factions.
11386/0:Shouldn't this be on?
11387/0:So.  You fail to appreciate the situation.  At first you looked like a skilled soldier out there, and now you just look like a bloodthirsty monster.  Get your butt to the SSC station.  Now.  
11388/0:
11389/0:No smoking in the Mako building.
11390/0:Distract people from what?
11391/0:It's not for public use anymore.  You'll have to wait in line and get proper clearance like everyone else now.
11392/0:Shutdown.
11392/1:Critical damage.
11392/2:System fail.
11393/0:I have to stay focused, but these strange events keep nagging at me.
11394/0:Just imagine how communication will change when every mind is linked together with lightspeed transmissions.
11395/0:The Plan has been carried out.
11396/0:Like what?
11397/0:Shrewd thinking.
11398/0:Grateful?  Miscommunication?  They were shooting at us!
11399/0:I need to return in time for the Summit.
11400/0:Yeah, you just move along there, young lady.
11401/0:Who the hell are YOU?  I made it clear to the Arcology Chairman that NG would not arrive until tomorrow and that regardless there would be no solicitations, no endorsements, and no appearances until showtime.
11402/0:Mina!  Did you hear that?
11403/0:Hey, Red, what're we gonna do about this guy?
11404/0:The Omar do not take such actions lightly.  For this hostile act, all preferred customer privileges are hereby revoked.
11405/0:Afraid so.
11406/0:I think they've grounded the flights until they can figure out what's going on with that copter that was circling.  
11407/0:Take care of your business, then find me at Pequod's Coffee on 107.  We'll negotiate a fee for the next hop.
11408/0:Any new news?  In the meantime, I've come up with something that might help you out.  I found it tucked away in a corner of the hangar.
11409/0:We can live in peace, or provoke them into exterminating us.  A simple choice.
11410/0:MJ-12?  The offshoot of the Illuminati?  This is almost unbelieveable.  They're the ones who started the Gray Death.  I was supposed to be part of a plot to take over the world?
11411/0:I came across a reference to an... ApostleCorp.  Do they own Tarsus or something?
11412/0:Would I be running if there was an emergency?  Me?  You never heard the name Leo Jankowski in Chicago?
11413/0:A lot of down-and-outs around here are signing up for this Templar outfit.  Me?  I take everything with a grain of salt.
11414/0:Who do you fear?  The Church?  The global syndicates?  It isn't any association of HUMANS that is going to take control.
11415/0:Guess you guys pulled it off.
11416/0:Hey!  HEY!  I'm not going to sit here and -- Janice!  What's --
11417/0:Hazard cleared.
11418/0:Evidence of hostility will be met with force.
11419/0:He intends to give every human being a nanite infusion -- That doesn't seem drastic to you?
11420/0:I could use a few EMP grenades.  Give me those.  [400]
11421/0:I refuse to waste my valuable time speculating.
11422/0:Ever had a Pequachino?  Tastes like laundry detergent.  They put it through seventeen stages of processing.
11423/0:Get MOVIN', feeb.
11424/0:I can't believe we're going to surrender the arcology, but I'm not complaining.
11425/0:State your name and business.
11426/0:Was it a food additive test?
11427/0:We can hear them, no longer caged and scared.
11428/0:Carry out your orders.
11429/0:Right!  Miss Withers...  She's pretty cool for someone who went to business school.
11430/0:So I'm going to be merged with Helios just like JC is?
11431/0:They just hired me -- I'm one of the bouncers.
11432/0:Come on, Bud.  Fill me in.  Did you hit it off?
11433/0:...yet more deviation from the Plan.  Paul was to arrive with the key, bringing the perfected genetic code.  JC was to awaken to greet the new age.  Instead, that woman came, followed soon after by the Hateful Ones.  Where is Paul?  What is going on?
11434/0:Yeah... I am sure that's what happened with Eeva and Jennifer.  They were two of the best -- there is no reason for them to have run away, they were selected for a new program.  I am sure of it.
11435/0:You wouldn't believe me.
11436/0:This is an historic moment that the SSC is proud to be a part of.  To demonstrate our commitment to making this a safe and productive meeting, I am flying to Trier myself to ensure that everything goes according to plan.
11437/0:Playin' it safe, huh?  How much?
11438/0:That's Saman's private system over there.  Get access to it and make a copy of the Sequencing Module.  JC Denton won't be able to hide for long now.
11439/0:Mr. Steed!  On the contrary --
11440/0:Can't say much more than that.
11441/0:Direct hit.
11442/0:Take that!
11443/0:That's finished.
11443/1:I wish it didn't have to end this way.
11444/0:Years of research -- wasted!
11444/1:At least we found out about this one's flaws sooner, rather than later.
11444/2:What a shock!  What a disappointment!
11444/3:We had such high hopes for you!
11445/0:The Headmaster is working for some fanatical secret society -- the Knights Templar.  He's been tracking the more promising students and plans to eliminate them.
11446/0:Argh!  I missed!
11446/1:I can't connect!
11447/0:You're not going to get the better of me.
11447/1:You can't defeat ME.
11448/0:I've been at this since before you were born.
11448/1:Rookie.
11448/2:I know everything you know, and more.
11449/0:Not much longer now.
11449/1:This was too easy.
11450/0:I'm going to put an end to your foolishness.
11450/1:So sad it has to end this way, but you clearly ARE flawed.
11451/0:I... better not get involved.
11452/0:Chicago was a professional job.  What we've got around here?  A couple of Lowtown gangs and a religious cult.  Purely small-scale operations.
11453/0:I can't imagine where they might be.
11454/0:(grunt)
11455/0:Well, I'd make it worth a certain someone's while, that's for sure.  [300 credits]  Why do you ask?  Know anything about government databases?
11456/0:Right.  Carry on, Alex.
11457/0:Order be praised -- those crooks have been trying to run us out of town.  Now take care of Sak so that she can't hire replacements.
11458/0:
11458/1:
11458/2:
11458/3:
11458/4:
11459/0:So ApostleCorp has some sort of home base in Cairo.  I think you found your next line of investigation.  But first you must steal those plans for the Mag Rail.
11460/0:I'll be ready.  Just say the word.
11461/0:An unfortunate circumstance for both parties.
11462/0:Go ahead.  Lie to me.  Lie to the public and lie to the poor saps who worship you and "Her Holiness."  It will just make your day of reconning that much more devastating.
11463/0:I could go through the teleporter, too, right?  I wonder why Mr. Dumier ordered me to stay here and secure the church.
11464/0:It's too bad about Chicago.  We were so close.
11465/0:That thing had you eating out of its hand, didn't it?  Their brains have been dissected, you know -- nothing but Cyrillic opcodes.  These cyborgs leech away resources from WTO enclaves as though they're still starving Russian researchers in post-Collapse science cities.
11466/0:Serious.  Another week of this, and I'm finished.
11467/0:What is wrong with you?  You can't ride through that radiation.
11468/0:... our dream realized...
11468/1:... the truth...
11468/2:... almost beyond imagination...
11468/3:... at last...
11469/0:(yawn)
11469/1:(ahem)
11469/2:(cough)
11470/0:All by yourself?
11471/0:Please stop that.
11471/1:Nice to see you have a sense of humor.
11472/0:Excuse me?
11472/1:Don't touch me.
11473/0:It's impolite to stare.
11473/1:What are you trying to figure out?
11474/0:I am not amused.
11474/1:I'm not sure what you're getting at.
11475/0:You're not authorized for this area.
11475/1:This area is restricted.  Turn back.
11476/0:(laughs) You're kidding, right?
11476/1:Put your weapon away.
11477/0:I am not amused.
11477/1:I don't have the time or the patience for your nonsense right now.
11478/0:You need work, you go to the Pit.  This is what I did.  I found work.  Mercenary.  Black market.  In a few hours, they send me to Egypt.  You said you never heard of Leo Jankowski?  Well, you just wait.
11479/0:You're really getting on my nerves.
11479/1:I don't see what this is going to prove.
11480/0:That's right, you arrived and you're still there.  I saw you myself -- the real NG Resonance.
11481/0:Thanks.  I'm just glad things are working out for you.  Keep your head down.
11482/0:Unless you have a better idea.
11483/0:Janice no longer works here.  Mr. Steed, this is the last "talk bullet."
11484/0:Look how dark it is, Ani.  The breathers only work up to twelve million ppl.
11485/0:Poor beasts...
11486/0:
11487/0:I've been waiting for your summons.  Please, make me a Knight.
11488/0:Citizens should be prepared for random searches while travelling Trier's streets.  Thank you for your cooperation.
11489/0:A black-market biomod would be great, if I could afford it.  [500]
11490/0:Pit's downstairs.
11491/0:
11492/0:If you're trying to intimidate me with that glare, it's not working.
11492/1:Don't forget to blink.
11493/0:Really, enough with this nonsense.
11493/1:Your antics are beginning to aggravate me.
11494/0:The Templars caught us off guard.  Most everyone is either dead or captured.
11495/0:Back off.
11495/1:Hey!
11496/0:When you have eliminated the threat and spoken to JC, go outside to the abandoned VersaLife base.  I see that you have already turned on the pilot beacon.  I will be able to meet you there.
11497/0:A little hyperactive, are we?
11497/1:Note to self: tone down humor genes in next rev...
11498/0:I'm serious.  Put that away or you'll be sorry.
11498/1:You're not prepared to back up that threat with action.  Believe me.
11499/0:If you do not leave the area, I will be forced to remove you myself.
11499/1:This area is off-limits -- I'm serious.
11500/0:This is your last warning.
11500/1:Do you know who you're messing with?
11501/0:I was just over by the Heron's Loft landing pad.  How'd Sophia Sak manage to get your jet?  Did you owe her money?
11502/0:Today marks the one year anniversary of the Refinery Riots, protesting the incorporation of Seattle into the WTO.  Mourners held a candlelight vigil in remembrance of those killed in the chaos.
11503/0:That's it.  I'm going to teach you a lesson.
11503/1:I warned you, and now you're going to pay the price.
11504/0:Glad to see you're finished with your theatrics.
11504/1:Good.  We can get back on track
11505/0:Not now!
11505/1:I have more pressing concerns.
11506/0:I took out the cyborg.
11507/0:He, too, is helpless and in need of our new systems.  We thought we had the infusions perfected three years ago, but his body rejected them, violently.  He had to be cryogenically frozen until we could finish the design.
11508/0:Do not interfere.
11509/0:I'm reconsidering your offer.  Which keys and codes have you got?
11510/0:In her generosity, Her Holiness has relaxed interpretations of doctrinal law.  It is time for a return to orthodoxy.
11511/0:
11512/0:I'm tired of standing around.  Let's do this.
11513/0:Don't think I don't notice things.  People coming and going.  They climb in the dumpster out there and disappear.
11514/0:Order be praised -- those crooks have been trying to run us out of town.  Now take care of Sak so that she can't hire replacements.
11515/0:I'm listening...
11516/0:The Headmaster is working for some fanatical secret society -- the Knights Templar.  He's been tracking the more promising students and plans to eliminate them.
11517/0:
11517/1:
11518/0:Leave me alone.
11519/0:Hello.
11519/1:Hi.
11519/2:Hey there.
11520/0:Doesn't matter much to me.  Sure -- take a look.  Go over to the weapon case and get ready to press that button.  Meanwhile, I'll unlock the controls from the safety of my office.  No offense -- but I'm not standing out in the open while a stranger is fingering the trigger of the Mag Rail.
11521/0:Right before getting me into this mess, the record company fired my manager.  Pretty stupid, huh?
11522/0:Hello.
11522/1:Hi.
11522/2:Hey there.
11523/0:I will not miss the school in the medina.  It is in a warehouse, and the teachers are all Seekers.
11524/0:That cat's on fire!
11525/0:Ha!  Something must have tried to pounce on that rat.
11526/0:Ha!  Something must have tried to pounce on that rat.
11527/0:You better not get me in trouble.
11528/0:Looks like something spooked the pigeons.
11529/0:Looks like something spooked the pigeons.
11530/0:What are we supposed to do?
11531/0:Birds sure are agitated....
11532/0:Okay, have it your way.
11533/0:Birds sure are agitated....
11534/0:They had deep roots in the local population and were able to call up a large number of paladins.  In addition, they have deployed a military bot in the mosque and two in the arcology.
11535/0:Someone's damaged this bot...
11536/0:You've shown appalling judgement, Alex.  I share your loathing of the Nassifs, but you've become a threat to a community protected by the Church.  I guess you took out Dr. Nassif for revenge, rather than for the ideals of the Order.  You leave me no choice but to send in a task force to destroy you.
11537/0:Are you sure you've got the right person?
11538/0:The cyborgs pay for beta code.  Believe me.
11539/0:
11540/0:Do me a favor.  Try to understand what this confilct is about before you murder anybody else.
11541/0:You will fall.  Your culture has already disintegrated into flimsy tatters.  We are merely sweeping the streets clean.
11542/0:Guess what I found out?  The Order and WTO are both puppets of the Illuminati.
11543/0:Read the field, then make your move.
11544/0:With the help of Agent Morgan, I learned that Luminon Saman is the traitor.  He has converted most of the Trier shard to his extremist views, incited the riots, and has been stealing equipment from the Panzerwerks factory.
11545/0:You might be interested in something I overheard at the Templar recruiting station in the arcology.
11546/0:Pequod's.  Coffee for your kind of world.
11547/0:Yeah, that's fascinating, but--
11548/0:Tarsus Tracking Report 4117 -- Alex D.  There are concerns that D. may be the greatest threat among his peers.  Last seen in Cairo, questioning Leila Nassif for the WTO.  Intel suggests that he now has objectives in Trier.  This makes it imperative that we get our agent through the gate immediately and shut it down.
11549/0:Someone's damaged this bot...
11550/0:I ran across some Templars in the apartment building across from the mosque.  Maybe they're the assault team.
11551/0:Pick a fight up here, you're on your own, man.  I got us this job, and I plan to collect.
11552/0:A generous offer.  I'll give it some thought.
11553/0:Hmmm... Whoever disabled it cannot have gotten far.
11554/0:Your advice?
11555/0:An investigation is underway, but it's been difficult.  None of my people made it back alive.
11556/0:Hmmm... Whoever disabled it cannot have gotten far.
11557/0:Sure, tell me about the guards.  I have a map of the area and you can show me.
11558/0:I've never seen a bot do THAT before.
11559/0:I've never seen a bot do THAT before.
11560/0:By Sidon, what do you think happened to that bot?
11561/0:Nothing is solved by foreigners coming here to sign useless treaties.
11562/0:By Sidon, what do you think happened to that bot?
11563/0:With this act, the geography of human thinking will be leveled.  Every mind will be part of a continuum.
11564/0:
11565/0:Dead.  One of his rivals in Germany.  You'll now be dealing with a Mr. Kirkpatrick.  The SMG shipment will arrive next week.
11566/0:Listen -- Her Holiness has much to teach us.
11567/0:Much activity now... much disruption.
11568/0:
11569/0:Your cavalier attitude toward human life is disgusting...  Nonetheless you got the info we needed from Nassif in Cairo.  For that, I'm giving you this extra biomod canister so that you might be a more effective operative.  Try to use it more wisely than you've been using your current resources.
11570/0:I have a job to do.
11571/0:All this spelunking just paid off... you found a biomod canister!  I wouldn't worry if it's collected a little dust -- your systems can incorporate the old protocol.
11572/0:We don't NEED to trust her, just keep her on a short enough leash.  As far as I'm concerned, she's just a trained beast.
11573/0:Yeah, it seemed like the paperwork was kinda odd on that one they shuffled back to the Flight Bay 24 storage room so quickly.
11574/0:We desire schematic data on a new product being developed at that facility.  Exoskeletal armor commissioned by the Knights Templar.  A potential combat threat to our organization.
11575/0:Say, what's with this door?
11575/1:Hmmm...  That door...  Someone must be snooping around.
11576/0:Say, what's with this door?
11576/1:Hmmm...  That door...  Someone must be snooping around.
11577/0:This door shouldn't be open.
11577/1:Door's open?  Odd...
11578/0:This door shouldn't be open.
11578/1:Door's open?  Odd...
11579/0:This door shouldn't be closed.
11579/1:I wonder how this door got closed.
11580/0:This door shouldn't be closed.
11580/1:I wonder how this door got closed.
11581/0:Someone really wanted to get past this door.
11581/1:That door's been destroyed!  Someone's up to no good.
11582/0:Someone really wanted to get past this door.
11582/1:That door's been destroyed!  Someone's up to no good.
11583/0:She brings destruction with her.  I hope you can end it.
11584/0:It looks like someone may have been playing with the lights.
11584/1:What's with the lights around here?
11584/2:I wonder what's going on with the lights.
11585/0:The question is whether you want to give individuals the power to impose such organization on a global scale -- and to imprint it, biologically, on our hearts and minds.
11586/0:
11587/0:
11588/0:Excellent.  By the Sword and the Trowel and the honor of the Magister Templi, I pronounce you a Knight of the Rosy Cross.
11589/0:Don't mess around too long, though, or I'll have to pay hangar fees.
11590/0:
11591/0:Your rescue mission was a failure.  Both of the shoppers are dead.  You'll be held responsible for putting those people at risk and failing to get them both to safety.
11592/0:Not now.  I'm concentrating.
11593/0:The Templars put a bounty on the Nassif family.  Maybe that's why you're here.
11594/0:It's never too soon to talk to your kids about the dangers of black market biomods.
11595/0:Looks like there's been a battle.
11596/0:I talk to everyone that I can.  You're very close but not quite the one I'm looking for.
11597/0:It's just a trick!
11597/1:I see your game now!
11598/0:May her Holiness guide my hand...
11598/1:May my aim be as true as my spirit...
11599/0:Her Holiness, protect me as I go into battle...
11599/1:May Order prevail...
11600/0:Shall we go?  I will be your pilot until we reach Liberty Island.
11601/0:Oh no, not again...
11601/1:Not this again...
11602/0:It looks like someone may have been playing with the lights.
11602/1:What's with the lights around here?
11602/2:I wonder what's going on with the lights.
11603/0:Prepare to defend yourself.
11604/0:I wonder how this got turned off.
11604/1:This area should be lit.
11605/0:(grunt)
11605/1:(grunt)
11606/0:I wonder how this got turned off.
11606/1:This area should be lit.
11607/0:Take that!
11607/1:Ha!
11608/0:I wonder who turned this on...
11608/1:This area should be dark.
11609/0:So ApostleCorp has some sort of home base in Cairo.  I guess we know where you're going to find your next target.  Your pilot will be waiting for you on the roof.
11610/0:Take that!
11610/1:Ha!
11611/0:I wonder who turned this on...
11611/1:This area should be dark.
11612/0:Show us what you can do, Alex.  With Tarsus gone, maybe a position with WTO Security would appeal to you.
11613/0:Too bad it has to end like this...
11613/1:What a shame... 
11614/0:I don't mean to interrupt....
11615/0:Smoke... That's strange.
11615/1: I wonder where that smoke is coming from.
11616/0:Me?  I know a bad situation when I see one.
11617/0:Smoke... That's strange.
11617/1: I wonder where that smoke is coming from.
11618/0:
11619/0:Blood!
11619/1:I'd say this blood is a sign I've got company.
11620/0:
11621/0:
11622/0:Right, Morgan told me to expect you, Alex.  She said you might want some help, especially since we suspect the Order may be plotting to assassinate Nassif.  My orders are to protect Nassif, no matter what.  We need her alive AND conscious for quick information extraction.
11623/0:
11624/0:Right on.  I'll tell him to put Snake-eyes in the chute.
11625/0:Stop bugging me.  People might begin to wonder.
11626/0:You sound like you want a favor.  What makes you think I'll say yes?
11627/0:Maybe Panzerwerks mechs aren't all they're cracked up to be.
11628/0:I checked out the school.  No sign of your daughter, but you should tell her to watch out for the headmaster.  He's only pretending to be a school administrator.
11629/0:You're lucky they make us check our weapons at the door.
11630/0:Admittance is by password only.
11631/0:At least modern aristocrats are democratically elected.  People vote with their pocketbooks.
11632/0:We expect that they just relocated it, since the beacon has to be within a certain range of the hangar bay to be useful.  But we can't get out to search for it, let alone activate it.  We suspect it may be up in the control room since that area is so heavily guarded.  If you can find it and turn it on, the SSC would know to send in a rescue chopper.
11633/0:I hope you've seen the error of your ways... and find Order in your next life.
11633/1:Another lost soul... liberated.
11633/2:May your spirit finally find peace.
11634/0:Drat!  I missed!
11634/1:Just missed 'em.
11635/0:I am satisfied.  Nothing remains that can challenge the Grand Masters.
11636/0:You cannot escape your fate!
11637/0:He's running away!
11638/0:Hate to see 'em go like that.  In his day, Claw was the biggest fighter around.
11639/0:I just hope Jamila and Jennifer are safe.
11640/0:Did you hear that they're trying to grow their own food down there?  Right in the middle of Nanite Swell 11.
11641/0:She's running away!
11642/0:Blood!
11642/1:I'd say this blood is a sign I've got company.
11643/0:I am protected by Her Holiness.  
11643/1:Your aim is untrue... just like your spirit.
11644/0:The shadows are flickering.
11644/1:Something... in the shadows...
11645/0:I will find you... and Order will be triumphant.
11645/1:I can't get a clear shot.
11646/0:The shadows are flickering.
11646/1:Something... in the shadows...
11647/0:Mmmph!
11647/1:Oooof!
11648/0:Hmm... Fire.
11648/1:Something's burning...
11649/0:(grunt) This is taking a lot out of me.
11649/1:Ungh.
11650/0:Hmm... Fire.
11650/1:Something's burning...
11651/0:Who'da thought the cooked meat would be Gob-zilla.  Wow, the end of an era.
11652/0:You confuse us with your shifting loyalty.
11653/0:(grunt) Her Holiness...  protect me now in my hour of need.
11653/1:(groan)
11654/0:By Sidon, it looks like there's been a recent exchange of fire here.
11654/1:Hmmm...  This zone saw gunplay not too long ago.
11654/2:At least whoever was involved doesn't have very good aim...
11655/0:By Sidon, it looks like there's been a recent exchange of fire here.
11655/1:Hmmm...  This zone saw gunplay not too long ago.
11655/2:At least whoever was involved doesn't have very good aim...
11656/0:Bullet holes?  
11656/1:
11657/0:Bullet holes?  
11657/1:
11658/0:My only regret is that Her Holiness did not survive to share this great day.  It was her willingness to participate in these negotiations that put her life at risk.  All of us involved in the compromise, from both sides of the table, would like to dedicate this effort to her memory.
11659/0:I'll be on my toes now that I know someone's lurking about with a boltcaster.
11660/0:I just came from Upper Seattle.  How'd you get this call past WTO security?
11661/0:Can I talk to Miss Sak?
11662/0:Is something wrong?
11663/0:That's why you refuse to support companies like QueeQueg's Coffee, which cut costs by exploiting poor bean growers.
11664/0:What do you know about the Tarsus Academy on Level 107?
11665/0:I don't know... I think I'd better play it safe right now.
11666/0:Address the flaws in human nature.  Make all beings truly equal in both body and mind.  If you start with minds that are lucid, knowledgable, and emotionally sound, the needs of government change dramatically.
11667/0:What about the VIP membership?
11668/0:Why do you want to know?
11669/0:Not for support staff.
11670/0:
11671/0:I... don't...  mmmfff...
11671/1:(grunt) Everything is... starting to spin...  mmmfff...
11672/0:Better than none of the above from Cindy.  (sardonic laugh)  Meet me outside the tavern.
11673/0:(shrieking)
11673/1:I'm on FIRE!!
11674/0:Nah, not yet.  I've got things to do.
11675/0:Time for you to go.
11676/0:(moan) It burns! 
11676/1:(moan) I can't see a thing!
11677/0:
11678/0:(groan)
11678/1:(groan)
11679/0:You look like the man on the holocomm who warned Dr. Nassif about the security breach.
11680/0:(sigh) peace... 
11680/1:Ommm... (gasp)
11681/0:I'll be on my toes now that I know someone's lurking about with a boltcaster.
11682/0:If you absolutely must leave the arcology structure, wear appropriate protective gear and return to a sealed area as soon as possible.  
11683/0:Ouch!
11683/1:Ungh!
11684/0:Nice knife.  Poor aim.
11685/0:(gasp)
11686/0:Nice knife.  Poor aim.
11687/0:Very funny.  You know, you don't seem very shy to ME.
11688/0:Order WILL prevail.
11688/1:The righteous will succeed.
11689/0:It's just a trick!
11689/1:Clever... but I'll still find you.
11690/0:It was good meeting you.
11691/0:Heretic!
11691/1:Infidel!
11691/2:Unbeliever!
11692/0:It's just a trick!
11692/1:Clever... but I'll still find you.
11693/0:We've been fooled!
11694/0:
11695/0:Heretic!
11695/1:Infidel!
11695/2:Unbeliever!
11696/0:We've been fooled!
11697/0:Gah!  Just one of those noisemakers...  
11698/0:I could use a little more cash so I can get out of this town in style.
11699/0:Gah!  Just one of those noisemakers...  
11700/0:It's only a noisemaker.  Ignore it.
11701/0:Huh?
11701/1:Hello?
11701/2:Maybe something's up?
11702/0:It looks like we'll be surrendering the arcology here shortly.  If you want to help out with the evacuation, see if you can find where the Templars moved the pilot beacon.  It's got to be nearby -- maybe it's up in the control room?  They have that area pretty well guarded...  Talk to the captain for details.
11703/0:I can't even afford the EMP grenades. [400]
11704/0:I'm away from my posh penthouse right now, probably partying at Club Vox again.  Stop by later.
11705/0:We have nothing further to discuss.
11706/0:You took care of him?  Well, you probably just saved someone's life.  He was ordered to self-destruct when he found the enemy.  This would have destroyed both of them and helped the Illuminati seize some sort of device that's supposed to make them all-powerful.
11707/0:Her Holiness has been corrupted by politics.  Perhaps now she will learn.
11708/0:Looks like we have a fight on our hands.
11709/0:Here you go.  Now keep your nose out of my business.
11710/0:Scan complete.  Your systems contain impressive innovations.
11711/0:JC Denton was the man responsible for the Collapse -- what good would it do to revive him?  Don't let ApostleCorp or the Illuminati use you as a pawn.  One wants to worship JC and the other wants to try to control him.  Neither group can see he's too mad and too powerful for either.  I'm going to destroy him while he's still weak -- it's the only sane answer.  
11712/0:It's always like this, when he goes away...
11713/0:Here we go again!
11713/1:Back for more?
11714/0:Here we go again!
11714/1:Back for more?
11715/0:Toward oneness. 
11715/1:Toward union with earth and spirit.
11715/2:Toward inmost Order.
11715/3:... Cetan... Cetan... Cetan...
11715/4:... Citta... Citta... Citta...
11715/5:... Phassa... Phassa... Phassa... 
11715/6:... Ekaggat... Ekaggat... Ekaggat...
11715/7:... ommmm... ommmm... ommmm...
11716/0:Hang on there, sport.
11717/0:We get paid just the same.  That's the only standard that matters to me.
11718/0:Here we go again!
11718/1:Back for more?
11719/0:(yawn)  
11719/1:... ahem...
11719/2:(cough)
11720/0:Thought I'd be an easy target, eh?
11720/1:I'm not going to give up.
11721/0:Can't you see I'm busy here?
11721/1:It's not safe to stop and talk.
11722/0:Thought I'd be an easy target, eh?
11722/1:I'm not going to give up.
11723/0:I'm sorry!
11723/1:Oh no!
11724/0:You'd better go.  Chairman Dumier will wonder what we've been talking about for so long.
11725/0:Sure, you expect this sort of thing in Cleveland, but not in Seattle.
11726/0:Thought I'd be an easy target, eh?
11726/1:I'm not going to give up.
11727/0:Excuse me?
11727/1:Please back off.
11728/0:It's only a noisemaker.  Ignore it.
11729/0:They stay down there, we stay up here -- that's the way it should be.
11730/0:At least the SSC is coming to bail us out.
11731/0:By transferring your biomod architecture to JC, you will complete his interface to the AI and bring him out of the coma.  This is a job we intended for Paul, but now it falls on your shoulders.
11732/0:I can't afford the energy cells right now. [600]
11733/0:I think you underestimated me.
11733/1:You're going to regret this.
11734/0:This is a restricted area.  
11734/1:This is not a public zone.
11735/0:Gah!  A smokescreen!
11736/0:I think you underestimated me.
11736/1:You're going to regret this.
11737/0:What are you looking at?
11737/1:Stop staring.  It's impolite.
11738/0:Gah!  A smokescreen!
11739/0:Something just wasn't right about the people who worked here.
11740/0:I think you underestimated me.
11740/1:You're going to regret this.
11741/0:Ummm... Is there a problem?
11741/1:Why are you acting like so strange?
11742/0:Looks like someone's playing tricks on us.  It's just harmless smoke.
11743/0:You should never have messed with us!
11743/1:We can handle this!  Piece of cake!
11744/0:Looks like someone's playing tricks on us.  It's just harmless smoke.
11745/0:Hey!  Watch where you point that thing!
11745/1:I don't appreciate these hysterics!
11746/0:Pay a bit more attenttion to your aim.
11746/1:I can only be so patient with such provocation.
11747/0:What's that?  Movement?
11747/1:How did that happen?
11748/0:What's that?  Movement?
11748/1:How did that happen?
11749/0:No more talking.
11750/0:Where did it go?
11750/1:By the skull of Sidon, it's missing!
11751/0:Excellent.  My technicians on Ophelia are already configuring the first operational Aquinas Hub in a generation... one which is in orbit and safe from tampering.  Now make sure that JC Denton is dead, and destroy his illegal machine.
11752/0:Where did it go?
11752/1:By the skull of Sidon, it's missing!
11753/0:We hope for new peace, less silence.
11754/0:You have your orders.  Proceed.
11755/0:That's not where it should be.
11755/1:It's clearly out of place.  People need to be more careful.
11756/0:The Order is on the right path.
11757/0:
11758/0:Please do not report any of these transactions.
11759/0:Got a problem?  The owner's probably around here somewhere.
11760/0:My money's on Green Dragon.
11761/0:The vultures always know when a man's down, don't they?  All right.  Here.  But you can forget the VIP membership.  Word got out about the Omar.  Our VIP lounge is closed indefinitely.
11762/0:I'm just an old bureaucrat.  I don't know anything about handling a real emergency.
11763/0:Can't afford that biomod. [500]
11764/0:No need for people to have the perception that we started these organizations for some other purpose.
11765/0:That makes you a private, too.
11766/0:I still don't have one.
11767/0:
11768/0:
11769/0:You should never have messed with us!
11769/1:We can handle this!  Piece of cake!
11770/0:You should never have messed with us!
11770/1:We can handle this!  Piece of cake!
11771/0:Knock it off.
11771/1:You're trying my patience.
11772/0:Just a scratch.
11772/1:You'll have to try harder than that.
11773/0:Stop jostling me!
11773/1:Back off!
11774/0:(wild laugh)  Thanks for the creds, old bean.  Think I'm gonna rag it over to Times Square to see Erin.  For what it's worth, here's a map of the island.  I figure you aren't leavin' that island, so why should I gamble my bird?  Right?  (laugh)  Over -- and -- out, scally...
11775/0:Just a scratch.
11775/1:You'll have to try harder than that.
11776/0:Get out of here! 
11776/1:You don't have clearance for this area.  Leave immediately.
11777/0:Just a scratch.
11777/1:You'll have to try harder than that.
11778/0:You're really wearing on my nerves, staring at me like that.
11778/1:Stop looking at me like that.
11779/0:(grunt)
11779/1:(grunt) I felt that one.
11780/0:Stop acting like a fool.
11780/1:Knock it off.
11781/0:(grunt)
11781/1:(grunt) I felt that one.
11782/0:Get away from me!
11782/1:What is your problem?!
11783/0:(grunt)
11783/1:(grunt) I felt that one.
11784/0:This isn't funny, it's dangerous.
11784/1:I will return the favor, if that's what you want.
11785/0:(groan) ... clearly means business.
11785/1:(grunt) This is really starting to add up.
11786/0:You must be private security for one of the factions.
11787/0:So there's ANOTHER Denton to worry about?
11788/0:You're cleared to go about your business.
11789/0:(groan) ... clearly means business.
11789/1:(grunt) This is really starting to add up.
11790/0:I only have so much patience with these shenanigans!
11790/1:You're going to cross the line, if you're not careful.
11791/0:That was your last warning...
11791/1:You're in trouble now.
11792/0:You do the bidding of JC Denton, but is your heart in it?  Or are you tempted to share the Aquinas specification with us?    We offer you your humanity, whereas he can give you nothing but a machine's simulation of humanity.
11793/0:Shall we conduct business?
11794/0:We are, but first the clam must give up its pearl.  Good luck, Special Agent Denton.  We will call on you when the time comes.  In case you need a pilot to take you to the compound, the Nine Worlds Tavern is a good place to hire one.
11795/0:Lovely.  See you at the terminal, mate.  Level 110, Flight Bay 23.  My jet's on a secure landing pad, so you'll have to contact me with the pilot beacon in the northeast corner of the main terminal.
11796/0:I hope Seattle isn't going to turn into another Chicago.
11797/0:Sloppy work, kiddo.
11798/0:Let's pray that she is.
11799/0:You aren't so special anymore, Denton.  Maybe you remember Billie Adams.
11800/0:He's a very busy man, but always has time for parents, especially those such as yourself.  I can just tell your child must be a star student.
11801/0:I've had some contact with the Order, but I haven't heard about any legal actions.
11802/0:The key I have is to the back stairwell.  It should get you into the kitchen via the storeroom.
11803/0:
11804/0:Only thing is I can't afford the feebsville markup.  That's where YOU come in.
11805/0:At least they haven't tried to suck out my brains and laminate my body with black Latex.
11806/0:I don't know what's gotten into her.  She was once a calm and devoted Seeker, like myself.
11807/0:Ach -- have you ever seen such a mess?
11808/0:That's a generous proposal.  I'll think about it.
11809/0:Are the paladins ready?
11810/0:All of the trainees in the program are Denton clones?  Even me?
11811/0:(groan) ... clearly means business.
11811/1:(grunt) This is really starting to add up.
11812/0:(groan) ...can't end like this.
11812/1:(groan) ...haven't got much strength left.
11813/0:(groan) ...can't end like this.
11813/1:(groan) ...haven't got much strength left.
11814/0:Good day.
11815/0:Lunatic!
11816/0:Let's go.
11817/0:(groan) ...can't end like this.
11817/1:(groan) ...haven't got much strength left.
11818/0:Good day.
11819/0:My main character, he's going to be extremely powerful but conflicted.
11820/0:Thanks for your help.
11821/0:Easy target!
11821/1:I tried to warn you...
11821/2:Take that!
11822/0:Eh?
11822/1:Huh?
11823/0:
11824/0:Easy target!
11824/1:I tried to warn you...
11824/2:Take that!
11825/0:Hm.
11825/1:What?
11826/0:
11827/0:Easy target!
11827/1:I tried to warn you...
11827/2:Take that!
11828/0:That again?
11828/1:More?
11829/0:I got him!
11829/1:He's an easy target.
11830/0:I got him!
11830/1:He's an easy target.
11831/0:What's that?
11831/1:Um, maybe I need to wake up here.	
11832/0:I got him!
11832/1:He's an easy target.
11833/0:Weird.
11833/1:Might be something.
11834/0:If you start to change your mind -- don't worry -- I'll be ready to pull the trigger.
11835/0:Hey!
11835/1:Whoa!
11836/0:I don't have to take this.
11836/1:You'll be sorry.
11837/0:Miss Sak thanks you.
11838/0:This is more than I ever bargained for.
11839/0:Perhaps I am too aggressive, but a society in which everyone understands everyone else is something I think we all should strive for.
11840/0:Not interested.  Sorry.
11841/0:Why this family?
11842/0:Oh -- well, they really aren't doing ME much good, true... but I can't bear to be completely defenseless.  You'll have to make do with what I gave you.
11843/0:Find the Aquinas specification, transmit it to my team in Munich, then neutralize the Dentons and step into their machine.  My scientists will modify your nanite architecture into a delivery vehicle for our cellular defense mechanism.
11844/0:Understood.  I'll be ready.
11845/0:I got her!
11845/1:She's an easy target.
11846/0:I got her!
11846/1:She's an easy target.
11847/0:What the --?!
11847/1:Eek!
11848/0:From here out, you deal directly with Sid.
11849/0:I got her!
11849/1:She's an easy target.
11850/0:Guess it was nothing.
11850/1:Just my imagination.
11851/0:That wasn't so hard.
11851/1:So much violence...
11851/2:I didn't think I had it in me.
11852/0:Maybe I just saw...
11852/1:Looked like something.
11853/0:Do tell me if you learn anything about the VIP area.
11854/0:That wasn't so hard.
11854/1:So much violence...
11854/2:I didn't think I had it in me.
11855/0:I know what I saw.
11855/1:I definitely saw something there.
11856/0:Okay.  You can pass, but you're instructed to report immediately to Chief Morgan at the WTO air terminal.
11857/0:Living in the comfort of a WTO arcology, it's easy to take for granted all the theory and work that went into constructing these living spaces.
11858/0:That wasn't so hard.
11858/1:So much violence...
11858/2:I didn't think I had it in me.
11859/0:That didn't sound right.
11859/1:Noisy.
11860/0:Are you okay? 
11861/0:Are you okay? 
11862/0:I felt that.
11862/1:Something bumped me.
11863/0:Are you okay? 
11864/0:Ouch!  That hurt.
11864/1:(grunt) Wha?
11865/0:They won't know what hit 'em.
11866/0:Oh God!  What if I'm next!?
11867/0:Oh no!
11867/1:What the hell?!
11868/0:I wasn't moping.
11869/0:I wish I didn't have to get up for work in the morning.
11870/0:You wrecked my equipment!  Get out!
11871/0:Hm.  Been knocked out.
11871/1:Whoa -- out cold!
11872/0:Helios is ready.  Think of it -- billions of perfect beings in instant communication with each other.  We're going to change what it means to be a human being.
11873/0:There's just something wrong with that whole damn machine....
11874/0:Ew.  A corpse.
11874/1:Someone's been killed!
11875/0:Let's go.
11876/0:
11877/0:I'm ruined!
11878/0:Good for you.
11879/0:Give me the biomod canister.  [500]
11880/0:If you don't already have one, then you're probably not supposed to have one... but there might be a compromise....
11881/0:Damn!  Green Dragon was my second-best fighter...
11882/0:Uh... I didn't.  You destroyed their coffee?
11883/0:I'm working for the Omar -- you know, the cyborgs.  They're a global operation these days.
11884/0:Hard to believe that two people would attempt to reconstruct all of global society.
11885/0:I guess you're here to wipe us out.  Like JC Denton wiped out the people who ran HIS trials.  Well, we aren't as diabolical as MJ-12 was.  I hope you aren't planning to trigger another Collapse...
11886/0:Oh God!  What if I'm next!?
11887/0:Oh God!  What if I'm next!?
11888/0:Aw.  It's scared.
11888/1:Wonder what's got it so spooked.
11889/0:Just a few more like that, and we'll be safe.
11890/0:It's broken.
11890/1:I'm not going to fix it.
11891/0:Just a few more like that, and we'll be safe.
11892/0:It's been destroyed.
11892/1:Whoa.  Been doing some remodeling.
11893/0:Just a few more like that, and we'll be safe.
11894/0:Hm.  It's been shut down.
11894/1:Wonder why that's disabled.
11895/0:You handled that well.
11896/0:You handled that well.
11897/0:It's not supposed to do that.
11897/1:Hm.  Must be a bug.
11898/0:You handled that well.
11899/0:It's not supposed to be on.
11899/1:I thought that was off.
11900/0:To reach the other levels of the arcology, exit the air terminal and take the ramp to the elevator.  It will take you to the main arcology concourse.  From there, you can reach the coffeeshop or the elevator to the Mosque, via which you can exit the arcology entirely.
11901/0:How can you desert me like this?!
11901/1:Coward!
11902/0:I thought that was supposed to be on.
11902/1:I don't think that should be off.
11903/0:How can you desert me like this?!
11903/1:Coward!
11904/0:What's it doing open?
11904/1:That's supposed to stay closed.
11905/0:And they called it Aquinas.
11906/0:I thought that was open.
11906/1:That shouldn't be closed.
11907/0:Moving?  That's weird.
11907/1:I wonder why that moved.
11908/0:Out, demons, out!  Out, demons, out!
11909/0:Here you go.  [250 credits.]
11910/0:Still unresolved.  Our people have the area closed to pedestrians.
11911/0:Order be praised, my Eeva is safe.  How do I repay you?  Here -- no arguing -- take a reward.  Money means nothing to me anymore.
11912/0:I am interested in the security chief in the unmarked suite on level 108 in the arcology.  His tissues are heavy with biotech.  Beta biocules?  The next rev of the Piezochem architecture?  Who knows, maybe something beyond.  I have a client who will pay handsomely to study one of his biomods.
11913/0:It'll take us a while to get cleaned up for the next match.
11914/0:...it's like a cat playing with it's prey.  Why don't they finish off those SSC holed up in the hangar already?
11915/0:I talked to Tracer Tong.  He says that Her Holiness is being held by the Templars.
11916/0:Don't worry about it.  I've already talked to him and he gave me the code for the maintenance closet.
11917/0:WTO incorporation opens new markets, so everyone has access to what they need.  That's only going to promote peace.
11918/0:Your enemies have occupied the island.
11919/0:If anything happens to Her Holiness, I don't want to imagine what will become of the Order Church.
11920/0:Then it will be time for you to do your part, Alex.  Everything depends upon you.
11921/0:A beauty, isn't it?
11922/0:How can you desert me like this?!
11922/1:Coward!
11923/0:(ahem)  We'll finish this when we've got more privacy.
11924/0:Hm.  It's missing.
11924/1:I wonder where it went.
11925/0:(ahem)  We'll finish this when we've got more privacy.
11926/0:That's out of place.
11926/1:It shouldn't be there.
11927/0:Our current plan nears closing, but we will continue our work in the shadows, as always.
11928/0:Oh, sure.  I'll wait for my own people, thanks.  I don't want to get myself SHOT.
11929/0:(ahem)  We'll finish this when we've got more privacy.
11930/0:Glad I missed the party here.
11930/1:Looks like a fight broke out.
11931/0:If you've got a multitool, you might try hacking the control panel next to the beams.  Or -- or something else that might work -- just blow the whole thing up with a grenade.
11932/0:Fantastic work this time... I'm impressed.
11932/1:I'll need to get this cleaned.
11932/2:I need more time on the mainframe...
11932/3:Mmmmm... Now what was I thinking...?
11932/4:The numbers just don't add up.
11932/5:Should've taken more theory at the university...
11932/6:That's what I get for trusting a simulation...
11933/0:Guess I'll have to check the database...
11933/1:My theory could be wrong -- but I doubt it.
11933/2:More sloppy measurements...
11933/3:I could sure use an assistant.
11933/4:Huh.  A laughable result...
11934/0:It's a trick.
11934/1:You can't fool me.
11935/0:Well, that's another story...
11936/0:Ready or not...
11936/1:Let's get this over with.
11937/0:It's not safe!
11937/1:We're in danger!
11938/0:Back for more?
11938/1:You again?
11939/0:Don't blink, muchacho.
11940/0:It's not safe!
11940/1:We're in danger!
11941/0:Where's your weapon?
11941/1:Think you can take me unarmed?
11942/0:Guess a little bit of excitement never hurt anyone.
11943/0:It's not safe!
11943/1:We're in danger!
11944/0:(grunt) 
11944/1:(grunt)
11945/0:Gotcha!
11945/1:Ha!  More where that came from.
11946/0:Bingo!
11946/1:I got a hit.
11947/0:Good day, ma'am.
11948/0:
11949/0:The EMP grenades sound good.  I'll take those. [400]
11950/0:She's all yours.
11951/0:We have committed acts of violence only when we believed it could save billions of pure human lives.  A few casualties are a reasonable price to pay to preserve humanity itself.  In the end, people will be grateful for our bravery and vision.
11952/0:
11953/0:2226 is some slimey lawyer.
11954/0:Perhaps I can be of assistance later.
11955/0:It was an accident...
11956/0:It was an accident...
11957/0:It was an accident...
11958/0:It was an accident...
11959/0:Please, listen to me.  The secrecy of our organization is vital, not just to you, but to the billions of people who will be affected by our research.
11960/0:(sneeze)
11960/1:(grumble)
11960/2:(whistle)
11960/3:(hum)
11961/0:Oh no!  I'm sorry! 
11961/1:Oops!
11962/0:(sneeze)
11962/1:(grumble)
11962/2:(whistle)
11962/3:(hum)
11963/0:Oh no!  I'm sorry! 
11963/1:Oops!
11964/0:Whoa.  I just killed someone.
11964/1:Yikes.  That was almost too easy.
11965/0:We can handle them, no problem.
11966/0:News travels fast around here.
11967/0:(sneeze)
11967/1:(grumble)
11967/2:(whistle)
11967/3:(hum)
11968/0:Oh no!  I'm sorry! 
11968/1:Oops!
11969/0:I can't make a shot.
11969/1:My aim is terrible.
11970/0:(sneeze)
11970/1:(grumble)
11970/2:(whistle)
11970/3:(hum)
11971/0:(grunt)
11971/1:(ahem)
11971/2:(sneeze)
11971/3:(grumble)
11971/4:(whistle)
11972/0:(sneeze)
11972/1:(grumble)
11972/2:(hum)
11973/0:(grunt)
11973/1:(ahem)
11973/2:(sneeze)
11973/3:(grumble)
11973/4:(whistle)
11974/0:Coward!
11974/1:You're just going to run?!
11975/0:Maybe I can help out.  I'm on my way to the arcology.
11976/0:(sneeze)
11976/1:(grumble)
11976/2:(hum)
11977/0:(grunt)
11977/1:(ahem)
11977/2:(sneeze)
11977/3:(grumble)
11977/4:(whistle)
11978/0:Missed me.
11978/1:Nice aim.
11979/0:Vermin!
11980/0:Come out, you coward.
11980/1:I can't see that feeb anymore...
11981/0:Vermin!
11982/0:(grunt) Omigod, I've been hit!
11982/1:(grunt) Oh nooo...
11983/0:Vermin!
11984/0:(grunt) Unggh.  That hurts.
11984/1:(grunt) Ooh... lightheaded...
11985/0:Please remember to clean the toaster oven in the facility kitchen when you are finished using it.
11986/0:Because that is how things really get done -- country club, penthouse suite, bedroom...
11987/0:What a cute little cat.
11988/0:(grunt) I'm fading.
11988/1:(grunt) Not much left.
11989/0:(grunt) Poison?
11989/1:(grunt) ...don't feel so well...
11990/0:(shrieking)
11990/1:I'm on fire!!
11991/0:We don't want you falling into the wrong hands.  You better go.
11992/0:A world in their own image, perhaps, one that wouldn't include ApostleCorp.  They categorically oppose all biomod technologies.  We think they might have staged the Chicago attack merely to ensure that our laboratory was destroyed.
11993/0:We cannot allow JC to continue to sleep.
11994/0:What does it matter, as long as I have customers?
11995/0:The flight deck is off limits to unauthorized personnel.
11996/0:When you're ready to go, just open the door.  The automatic weapons reactivation systems take care of everything.
11997/0:Hydroponics failure.
11998/0:It's even possible they waited to tell us because they wanted to see how people react to exposure.
11999/0:(sneeze)
11999/1:(grumble)
11999/2:(hum)
12000/0:(sneeze)
12000/1:(grumble)
12000/2:(hum)
12001/0:(sneeze)
12001/1:(grumble)
12001/2:(whistle)
12001/3:(hum)
12002/0:Then why are you confiding this in me?
12003/0:(sneeze)
12003/1:(grumble)
12003/2:(whistle)
12003/3:(hum)
12004/0:Talk to Red.  He's the friendly one.
12005/0:(sneeze)
12005/1:(grumble)
12005/2:(whistle)
12005/3:(hum)
12006/0:What a cute little cat.
12007/0:(sneeze)
12007/1:(grumble)
12007/2:(whistle)
12007/3:(hum)
12008/0:What a cute little cat.
12009/0:Do I... know you?  Where's Tong?
12010/0:Huh?  A rat...
12011/0:Look at that bird.
12012/0:Miss Withers, huh?  I'll let you know if I run into her.
12013/0:Huh?  A rat...
12014/0:Look at that bird.
12015/0:Huh?  A rat...
12016/0:Look at that bird.
12017/0:Huh?  A rat...
12018/0:Stand back!  I tossed in a grenade!
12019/0:Well, of course.  I --
12020/0:Just visiting New Seattle.
12021/0:Stand back!  I tossed in a grenade!
12022/0:Stand back!  I tossed in a grenade!
12023/0:At last, my scientists succeeded.  You are the complete solution.  My brother, Paul, was to be upgraded first so that he could carry the infusions through the Gate, but there was a setback.
12024/0:Incoming!
12025/0:Incoming!
12026/0:I don't know what Paul's status is, but I'm sure any resources you've got would be useful.
12027/0:A stupid thing to do.
12028/0:You could've told me and the other trainees about the experiments.
12029/0:I'm just on watch.  Talk to the teacher if you need something.
12030/0:What brings the German Luminon to Cairo?
12031/0:The thing about a greasel fight, it has more to do with upbringing than breeding.  A greasel's a greasel.
12032/0:Nothing, but I've got a girl waiting for me in Trier, Germany.  Protester-type.  She's there for the summit.
12033/0:Please return when you have adequate funds.
12034/0:This city is lost.  Toxic air and fanatics enforcing martial law.
12035/0:Guess you're probably here to deal with the hostage situation.
12036/0:The black market biomod sounds great, but I haven't got the credits. [1000]
12037/0:Huh?  A rat...
12038/0:It's still the champ, I think.  They call it Gob-zilla.  Real cute.
12039/0:Huh?  A rat...
12040/0:Huh?  A rat...
12041/0:Huh?  A rat...
12042/0:Huh?  A rat...
12043/0:Incoming!
12044/0:Huh?  A rat...
12045/0:Uh-oh.  Someone's boobytrapping the place.
12046/0:Huh?  A rat...
12047/0:Uh-oh.  Someone's boobytrapping the place.
12048/0:Huh?  A rat...
12049/0:Uh-oh.  Someone's boobytrapping the place.
12050/0:This is what we've been reduced to?!
12051/0:Hm, stray cat.
12052/0:I'm trying to track someone down -- noticed anything unusual?
12052/1:Has anyone come this way?
12053/0:Hm, stray cat.
12054/0:I'm trying to track someone down -- noticed anything unusual?
12054/1:Has anyone come this way?
12055/0:I'm trying to track someone down -- noticed anything unusual?
12055/1:Has anyone come this way?
12056/0:Until we can get a lift, we're stuck here, under siege.
12057/0:I'm following someone.  Have you noticed anything out of the ordinary?
12058/0:I got your jet back.  Isn't that good enough?
12059/0:I'm following someone.  Have you noticed anything out of the ordinary?
12060/0:I'm following someone.  Have you noticed anything out of the ordinary?
12061/0:Every person on Earth will be merged, to one degree or another.
12062/0:No offense, but I don't want any of your nanites near me.
12063/0:You care about the people who lost everything during the Collapse.
12064/0:We only want to be left in peace.  We come to help JC to make this the last conflict.
12065/0:I keep telling my little girl -- the security force here will keep us safe no matter what happens in other places.
12066/0:JC Denton needs you alive in order for the procedure to work.  That is the only reason I haven't abandoned you.
12067/0:I dropped you right in front of Nine Worlds Tavern.  Best starkbier in the city.  Not a bad place to ask around if you want to find one of the locals.  Lemme park the jet, and you can find me at the tavern later when you're ready for another hop.
12068/0:Order be praised.  May Her Holiness watch over and guide you.
12069/0:What the HELL do you think you're doing?
12070/0:Luminon Saman from the German Shard.  My pleasure.  I was HOPING one of Billie's former classmates would show up.
12071/0:What are you studying?
12072/0:Please do something.  Tell the authorities or stop Archer yourself.  We can't.
12073/0:
12073/1:
12073/2:
12074/0:Hm, stray cat.
12075/0:Wish I had the buy-in money, but I don't.  [100 credits]
12076/0:Hm, stray cat.
12077/0:Hm, stray cat.
12078/0:
12079/0:Hm, stray cat.
12080/0:Well, she's dead.  Happy now?
12081/0:First install your biomods, then I'll open the door.  The upgrades will improve your survivability now that we can't protect you.
12082/0:Hm, stray cat.
12083/0:I'm following a guy.  Have you seen him?
12084/0:Hm, stray cat.
12085/0:I'm following a guy.  Have you seen him?
12086/0:Hm, stray cat.
12087/0:I'm following a guy.  Have you seen him?
12088/0:Hm, stray cat.
12089/0:I'm following this lady.  Have you seen her?
12090/0:I ran into this commando.  No longer a factor.
12091/0:Sorry, I'm on duty.
12092/0:Hm, stray cat.
12093/0:I'm following this lady.  Have you seen her?
12094/0:Hm, stray cat.
12095/0:I'm following this lady.  Have you seen her?
12096/0:Just kidding.  Listen, I'm serious.  You didn't hear the explosions?  I saw a guard killed right in front of me on the apartment level.
12097/0:Do you know what that could be?
12098/0:Do you know what that could be?
12099/0:I do kinda miss the frisking though...
12100/0:Do you know what that could be?
12101/0:Did you hear something?
12102/0:
12103/0:I see you found what I brought you from Cairo -- the biomod canister on the crate over there.  It was a payment from the Omar.  Personally, I'm done with biomodification.
12104/0:They say she writes all of her own material.  Right -- her and a team of about a hundred composers in a WTO enclave somewhere.
12105/0:You kinda snuck up on us.  I guess I'm a little jumpy from all the attacks.
12106/0:I believe in dialogue -- don't get me wrong.  But it takes more than words to win over the hearts of the people.
12107/0:They ambushed me.  Didn't like that I was beginning to unravel their network.
12108/0:We have good reason to believe that ApostleCorp's headquarters are in Cairo.  This is where she would go looking for help.
12109/0:I thought we understood each other, Alex.  Oh well.  I guess it won't come as any surprise that I'm going to have to kill you before you can reach the Statue.  What you want to do threatens my life's work.  See you shortly.
12110/0:Don't trust this guy.  Keep looking -- we need to know Dr. Nassif's location.  Search the director's private office off this room for clues to her whereabouts.  A datacube or vmail may point the way. 
12111/0:Been here a long time, gave me a chance to pretty the place up, with my paintings.
12112/0:Go ahead.  I'll watch the rear.
12113/0:I guess I do not have the right pedigree to live with you rich types.
12114/0:
12115/0:I'm a writer, in case you were wondering.  A novelist.  My job is to understand this rush of experience that sails past people around here -- and then fling it back in their faces.
12116/0:More birds.
12117/0:More birds.
12118/0:More birds.
12119/0:More birds.
12120/0:More birds.
12121/0:I... better not get involved.
12122/0:More birds.
12123/0:More birds.
12124/0:You'd better introduce yourself to the others.  Klara's just down the hall, and Leo's running laps around the track.
12125/0:More birds.
12126/0:
12126/1:
12127/0:More birds.
12128/0:I'm starting to believe some of that stuff myself, actually.  It's just saturation.  Finally your brain just gives up.
12129/0:More birds.
12130/0:The WTO will get everything back under control, though.  Just give us time.
12131/0:I don't know.  This is my first time at an NG kiosk....
12132/0:
12133/0:It may be surrender, but at least it's on our own terms and with a minimum of casualties.
12134/0:I talked to Tracer Tong.  He says that Her Holiness is being held by the Templars.
12135/0:But you could fix them, right?
12136/0:I brought you something from Cairo, by the way -- the biomod canister on the crate over there.  It was a payment from the Omar.  Personally, I'm done with biomodification.
12137/0:I have spoken.
12138/0:More birds.
12139/0:More birds.
12140/0:(laugh)  That's gotta sting...
12141/0:Explosives!
12142/0:Explosives!
12143/0:Explosives!
12144/0:Something didn't add up quite right on last night's shipment.
12145/0:Explosives!
12146/0:Yes, young Pliable.  Dr. Todd is waiting for you in the flight bay.  Do as he asks.  As long as you cooperate, my paladins will hold their fire.  I will have additional instructions for you when you reach Liberty Island.
12147/0:Explosives!
12148/0:Explosives!
12149/0:Explosives!
12150/0:Explosives!
12151/0:Never cower from the Truth.
12152/0:Billie Adams must be destroyed.  If she damages the Helios core, she will destroy JC's mind.
12153/0:Good work.  Power is restored and the beacon is ready to be activated.  Just turn it on and your pilot will be able to land.  But first you must find a way into JC's sanctuary.  You are our only hope of reviving him.
12154/0:Terrorists... wonder what they want...
12155/0:The bodies of two of the missing students, Jennifer McAllister and Eeva Nassif, have just been discovered in Old Cairo.  In addition, the Headmaster has recently disappeared.
12156/0:You know that Queequeg's coffee beans are slow-roasted in convective drums for maximum fidelity to regional flavor.
12157/0:Here's a key to the gate in the courtyard.  Like I said, the facility is on the north side of the city.
12158/0:
12159/0:
12160/0:How do I do that?
12161/0:Busy man.
12162/0:Go ahead.  Take it.
12163/0:Sure, take out Dumier's commandos on the dock.  [500]
12164/0:Shouldn't this be on?
12165/0:Maybe I'm just jumpy after that copter refused to follow protocol or land.
12166/0:Shouldn't this be on?
12167/0:Shouldn't this be on?
12168/0:Shouldn't this be on?
12169/0:Explosives!
12170/0:I can't get by!
12171/0:Explosives!
12172/0:I can't get by!
12173/0:Her Holiness had the vision to start the movement, but Luminon Saman has the drive to complete it.
12174/0:Explosives!
12175/0:I can't get by!
12176/0:Explosives!
12177/0:I can't get by!
12178/0:I want to wipe out the Dentons.
12179/0:I was attacked.  Seen anyone suspicious?
12180/0:I can't get by!
12181/0:I was attacked.  Seen anyone suspicious?
12182/0:I can't get by!
12183/0:Have a good day.
12184/0:Yeah?  All of it?
12185/0:I was attacked.  Seen anyone suspicious?
12186/0:Our research isn't ready for public consumption yet.
12187/0:I am nervous enough about my grades.  And you will get me in trouble with the teacher.
12188/0:I was attacked.  Seen anyone suspicious?
12189/0:I want to report criminal activity at the Tarsus school.
12190/0:I was attacked.  Seen anyone suspicious?
12191/0:I was attacked.  Seen anyone suspicious?
12192/0:This is a LABORATORY, let me remind you.
12193/0:I said, "Take my things to the VIP lounge" -- and they stick me down here.
12194/0:That would be a big mistake.  You'll be marked if you start doing jobs for the Harvester.  But there's no point debating about it.  Tell you what.  Let me live and I'll give you the keypad code to the nanoformer bot bay.
12195/0:Alex!  You were right, Her Holiness and Mr. Dumier had a secret alliance all along.
12196/0:Isn't it true that we are approaching a watershed moment in international affairs in which two great powers, separated so far by circumstance and the fog of reconstruction, finally begin to bump elbows?
12197/0:
12198/0:If you can sneak past the camera, or take it out with EMP, you'll be fine.  As soon as that camera catches sight of a target, the turret opens fire.
12199/0:Oh, okay.  Well it is good to hear they are safe.  I will keep their secret.
12200/0:
12201/0:I will be waiting.
12202/0:We can after we eliminate the leadership of these factions and destroy whatever it is JC Denton is building inside the Statue.
12203/0:Match 8!  Bad news -- the champ's been cooked in her own crib.  Gob-zilla is no more!  But house rules will provide.  Reigning trainer gets a free substitution.  Four-to-one odds stand.  Buy-in is the house minimum.  [100 credits.]
12204/0:I can't get by!
12205/0:Let's pick another target.  I gotta keep moving to stay warm.
12206/0:Have the Templars -- I mean, the Hateful Ones -- caused any other trouble for you since their arrival?
12207/0:Yeah... I am sure that's what happened with Eeva and Jennifer.  They were two of the best -- there is no reason for them to have run away, they were selected for a new program.  I am sure of it.
12208/0:I can't get by!
12209/0:You see so many faces, you get to where you can read people's minds.
12210/0:What a day.
12211/0:I can't get by!
12212/0:I can't get by!
12213/0:I was attacked.  Seen anyone suspicious?
12214/0:I can't get by!
12215/0:I was attacked.  Seen anyone suspicious?
12216/0:I can't get by!
12217/0:I was attacked.  Seen anyone suspicious?
12218/0:Door's stuck.
12219/0:Why not?
12220/0:I was attacked.  Seen anyone suspicious?
12221/0:Door's stuck.
12222/0:Terrorists... wonder what they want...
12223/0:I was attacked.  Seen anyone suspicious?
12224/0:Door's stuck.
12225/0:I was attacked.  Seen anyone suspicious?
12226/0:Door's stuck.
12227/0:Some monster attacked me, and now I've got to find it -- seen anything?
12228/0:Are you tired of breathers?  Are you sick of the Plague 11 cough?  Have you had it with dizzy spells?  I want to tell you about an amazing new elixir.
12229/0:Some monster attacked me, and now I've got to find it -- seen anything?
12230/0:Tarsus Tracking Report 4117 -- Alex D.  There are concerns that D. may be the greatest threat among her peers. Last seen in Cairo, eliminating Leila Nassif for the Order.   Intel suggests that she now has objectives in Trier.  This makes it imperative that we get our agent through the gate immediately and shut it down.
12231/0:Some monster attacked me, and now I've got to find it -- seen anything?
12232/0:These scientists will be made quiet permanently.  They will end once we are free.
12233/0:Some monster attacked me, and now I've got to find it -- seen anything?
12234/0:Do I LOOK stupid?
12235/0:I see.  Sorry to hear that.
12236/0:Please carry on with your business.
12237/0:Hey, are you one of the workers from that factory, under the canal?  My mom said to see if you need a message boy... We need the credits.
12238/0:The kitties tell me to do things...to myself.
12239/0:(laugh)  That's gotta sting...
12240/0:That's a generous proposal.  I'll think about it.
12241/0:The door is stuck!
12242/0:Door's stuck.
12243/0:Door's stuck.
12244/0:I'm ready.
12245/0:Door's stuck.
12246/0:Some monster attacked me, and now I've got to find it -- seen anything?
12247/0:Door's stuck.
12248/0:Some monster attacked me, and now I've got to find it -- seen anything?
12249/0:Door's stuck.
12250/0:Some monster attacked me, and now I've got to find it -- seen anything?
12251/0:Door's stuck.
12252/0:Some monster attacked me, and now I've got to find it -- seen anything?
12253/0:Door's stuck.
12254/0:Some monster attacked me, and now I've got to find it -- seen anything?
12255/0:Gotta move this myself.
12256/0:Some monster attacked me, and now I've got to find it -- seen anything?
12257/0:Gotta move this myself.
12258/0:Some monster attacked me, and now I've got to find it -- seen anything?
12259/0:Some monster attacked me, and now I've got to find it -- seen anything?
12260/0:I can't believe he would recruit some modified freak, especially for a mission as critical as this one.
12261/0:Seen anything suspicious?
12262/0:Seen anything suspicious?
12263/0:Sounds like a valuable invention.  Why aren't they manufacturing it?
12264/0:Of course they....  Wait a minute -- you don't work for Mr. Kurczec!
12265/0:One Metro Pass, please.  [250 credits]
12266/0:Gotta move this myself.
12267/0:Gotta move this myself.
12268/0:I must move this myself!
12269/0:Gotta move this myself.
12270/0:Seen anything suspicious?
12271/0:Gotta move this myself.
12272/0:Seen anything suspicious?
12273/0:Gotta move this myself.
12274/0:Training's so important because greasels all come from the same genetic line, made by a company called VersaLife, which I guess must've gone bankrupt after the Collapse.
12275/0:This ain't exactly an airport up here.
12276/0:Seen anything suspicious?
12277/0:Gotta move this myself.
12278/0:Seen anything suspicious?
12279/0:Gotta move this myself.
12280/0:Seen anything suspicious?
12281/0:Gotta move this myself.
12282/0:I thought QueeQueg's stood for something.
12283/0:Seen anything suspicious?
12284/0:Gotta move this myself.
12285/0:Doesn't matter if you dress spiffy.  I don't fly scabs who can't pay the fare.
12286/0:Seen anything suspicious?
12287/0:I already took a peek at the club's records.
12288/0:Seen anything suspicious?
12289/0:Seen anything suspicious?
12290/0:Seen anything suspicious?
12291/0:We are working to protect the Earth.  We have no interest in materials or money.
12292/0:Penthouse.  Nice.
12293/0:What is wrong with you?  You can't ride through that radiation.
12294/0:I thought this place was supposed to be a fortress.
12295/0:Any special instructions for the drop?  Strafing run?  Hostile insertion?  Drop you near a pub?  You're payin' for quality, remember.
12296/0:Not important, so long as it knows how to keep Order...
12297/0:Tell Eddie it's time for the next fight.
12298/0:I have done that THREE times already.  This is ridiculous.
12299/0:I don't know anything else about it.
12300/0:Don't worry about it.  I've already talked to him and he gave me the code for the maintenance closet.
12301/0:We thought we had enough troops ready to deal with anything that could happen.  I guess we were wrong.
12302/0:Well... it's not unusual for a company to promote more than one brand of a product.
12303/0:That's too dangerous.  Better stay back.
12304/0:That's too dangerous.  Better stay back.
12305/0:Thanks for doing all the hard work, finding the way in here.  All I had to do was follow in your footsteps and now I'm just minutes away from completing my objective.
12306/0:That's too dangerous.  Better stay back.
12307/0:That's too dangerous.  Better stay back.
12308/0:That's too dangerous.  Better stay back.
12309/0:That's too dangerous.  Better stay back.
12310/0:Query:  Subject D is reliably allied to Illuminati?
12311/0:That's too dangerous.  Better stay back.
12312/0:Maybe you should leave town.
12313/0:Arcology scientists are presently investigating cleanup alternatives.
12314/0:That's too dangerous.  Better stay back.
12315/0:That's too dangerous.  Better stay back.
12316/0:Normally I would have you killed on the spot, but you are still my best asset against Saman.  Hopefully, in time, you will change your opinion of my cause.
12317/0:You also know that Queequeg's Coffee imports exclusively from independent coffee growers from around the world.
12318/0:What's the situation here, Captain?
12319/0:That's too dangerous.  Better stay back.
12320/0:I'll see what I can do.
12321/0:The price on those prox mines is too steep for me. [600]
12322/0:Dr. Nassif is up ahead.  You're being used, Alex.  All the WTO wants is to steal her research and clone their own lab specimens.  The wisest alternative is to kill her before she can be interrogated.
12323/0:It's an unusual assignment, but I'm committed to carrying it out. Let's go.
12324/0:Attention citizens: Flight Bay 24 is closed until further notice.  The space has been leased to a private organization.
12325/0:Is he that bad?
12326/0:
12327/0:I already found their hideout and I took down that trader before he could say a word.
12328/0:We've got trouble.  I spotted a Seeker coming our way.  Look, there's no reason for me to drag a trainee into a firefight.  Why don't you try to slip out before I start shooting.
12329/0:No thanks.
12330/0:Huh?
12330/1:Eh?
12330/2:Hello?
12331/0:Miss Cutie-pie gave me ten minutes to clear out.  She had my WTO citizenship revoked, too -- just like that!  I'm ruined!  Damn you mercenaries!
12332/0:I've got to prepare my troops for departure and debriefing.
12333/0:There were stories about sacrifices... I do not believe those, but Seekers are definitely strange.
12334/0:Never heard of him.
12335/0:
12335/1:
12335/2:
12335/3:
12335/4:
12335/5:
12336/0:
12336/1:
12336/2:
12336/3:
12337/0:You don't have any extra pilots?
12338/0:QueeQueg's.  A taste of class.
12339/0:Suspicion naturally gravitates toward the nondenominational faith known as the Order.  But who are the Order?  
12340/0:That's too dangerous.  Better stay back.
12341/0:That's too dangerous.  Better stay back.
12342/0:I need you to return to Cairo to rescue my brother, Paul, who was seized by the Templars.  Then meet me at Liberty Island, where in the ruins of an old military base there is an Aquinas node that can be used to distribute the infusion technology world-wide.
12343/0:Have fun.  
12344/0:I do have my own army, you know.
12345/0:That's right.  You already lost.
12345/1:Let's see what you got!
12346/0:Looks like a bad upgrade... Jesus!
12346/1:Damn it, bot -- I'm not the enemy!
12347/0:Everything satisfactory, miss?  I am the owner.
12348/0:You got this coming.
12348/1:Nobody hits and just walks away.
12349/0:I can't wait until the next album.
12350/0:Don't blame ME if you get caught in the crossfire...
12351/0:I need to go to the Rauchstadt area.
12352/0:This changes everything.
12353/0:Well, don't think we're all fanatics about that stuff.  You won't see ME taking any mods, but, you know, to each his own.  My unit got sent down here to see if we could find an unlock control for the Denton bunker.  Figures we'd get jumped by a bunch of mutants.  I'm the only one left.
12354/0:You--!
12355/0:This is WTO Security Chief Donna Morgan.   You were told to report to the air terminal.  Very well, but do us a favor.  The Minister of Culture lives in the penthouse here.  We believe he is smuggling equipment and violating WTO import-export regulations.  Search his apartment for a vault containing contraband.
12356/0:Terrorists... wonder what they want...
12357/0:It sounds like there's some sort of history between you and Chad Dumier.
12358/0:Unbelievable -- the Chairman himself is a Templar.  Maybe you should locate the files he was talking about and confront him in the hangar bay.  But first check out that ApostleCorp facility.  Your assignment will be to eliminate Dr. Nassif before she gives any information to the Templar extremists -- or to the WTO.
12359/0:Remember: an Omar Trader is always nearby when you are ready to conduct business.
12360/0:If you see any suspicious activity, please report it to the SSC office immediately.
12361/0:Give me the ammo clips. [600]
12362/0:Let's make this a quick one.
12362/1:Okay paladins, eyes open.
12363/0:This area is clear.
12364/0:I'm lucky you came along when you did.
12365/0:I think I cut him... see any blood?
12365/1:He's breathing.  Hear that?
12365/2:Run him down.
12366/0:She isn't finished.
12366/1:Run her down.
12366/2:She's breathing.  Hear that?
12367/0:Nur Gewehre has been in my family for three generations.  I have been locking up since I was a boy.
12368/0:
12369/0:They caught us with our guard down.  It won't happen again.
12370/0:...in my sights...
12371/0:...in my sights...
12372/0:...in my sights...
12373/0:...in my sights...
12374/0:The Order is on the right path.
12375/0:...in my sights...
12376/0:...in my sights...
12377/0:When you drink a cup of coffee, you drink Pequod's, because Pequod's is a pioneer of the new economy: efficient, modern, clean...
12378/0:Look at him struttin' round the pit, showin' off just like his Daddy...
12379/0:
12380/0:The WTO appreciates the help of conscientious citizens.
12381/0:I only talked to Billie briefly in Seattle, but I could tell right away that something was off.
12382/0:We're fortunate that the beacon's been activated.  Otherwise, I have no idea what would've happened to us.
12383/0:It's just hard to keep quiet after an experience like that!
12384/0:Your first responsibility is to Templar HQ -- remember that.  I just spent two hours trying to convince our superiors that they haven't wasted millions on the power-armor research, even though you've leaked key design specs.
12385/0:The arcology was supposed to be safe.  That is the whole point of the WTO.
12386/0:JC's plan, it will bring new evenness, and quiet your kind's hostilities.
12387/0:We have been instructed to let you pass.
12388/0:We never stole from you.  We only employed the necessary tactics to stop you from harming the natural Order.
12389/0:But -- armed guards in a nightclub?
12390/0:You work in a lab or something?
12391/0:I heard there was an accident....  Sorry to spoil your plans.
12392/0:Very well.  We will be enemies.
12393/0:I took personal responsibility for Trier security.  I guess I have to take responsibility for what happened to Max.
12394/0:...in my sights...
12395/0:Coy boy... What's the matter?  Don't like talking politics?
12396/0:...in my sights...
12397/0:...in my sights...
12398/0:That ain't his name -- it's a Templar title.  Like "private."  Now move your feeb ass.
12399/0:...in my sights...
12400/0:If you don't already have one, then you're probably not supposed to have one... but there might be a compromise....
12401/0:...in my sights...
12402/0:...in my sights...
12403/0:Yes... well... your father was just being a comedian...
12404/0:
12405/0:Oh, and by the way, it has come to my attention that you rooted out some corruption in the New Cairo arcology.  Well done.  It's my pleasure to present you with the Citizen's Bonus in person.
12406/0:Looks pretty rough down there.  Pity you couldn't afford a couple of my Sunfire missiles to help you out.  For what it's worth, here's a map of the island.  Later, old bean.  Think I'm gonna rag it over to Times Square to see Erin.
12407/0:
12408/0:This changes everything.
12409/0:So you've been here two weeks.  Any advice?
12410/0:Give me the biomod. [1000]
12411/0:
12412/0:I knew pinching all this stuff would pay off.
12413/0:Maybe I should leave town.  
12414/0:You'd better be ready.  After everything he's done to undermine the Grand Master's plans, he definitely wants this guy taken down.
12415/0:Your followers must understand the need for dialogue.
12416/0:WTO indifference to nanite pollution is the reason for the plague that has decimated the village.  If you and Billie can help the locals, maybe you can win their trust and get some information on Dr. Nassif.
12417/0:I can't believe that after everything you learned in meeting with the Order members that you persist in seeking out the WTO.  (sigh)  May Her Holiness watch over you.
12418/0:WTO incorporation opens new markets, so everyone has access to what they need.  That's only going to promote peace.
12419/0:You're lucky to have someone like that looking after your interests.
12420/0:Please return when you have adequate funds.
12421/0:A remarkable achievement.  You do not even comprehend today's significance for the future of this planet, but you have our gratitude.  A discount will be applied to all of your business transactions with our agents, anywhere in the world.
12422/0:You are obviously not from around here.
12423/0:I'll leave you to your scheming.
12424/0:The Omar moved into Trier a few months ago.  I knew I had to adapt or get out of town.
12425/0:Thank you.  I'd almost given up hope.  This morning I lost my daughter to the plague.  And today was to be her first day at the Tarsus school.  Thank you for helping to get her admitted -- we were so happy.  Oh!  (sob)  I was here to claim the body when the Templars attacked.
12426/0:Yes?
12426/1:For Purity.
12426/2:Our ranks are always open.
12427/0:Sir.
12428/0:Time to send in a bot.
12429/0:Time to send in a bot.
12430/0:Leo?  Is that you?  The frogsuit threw me for a second.
12431/0:Dr. Nassif would never have told you to come HERE.
12432/0:I'm a little low on funds right now.
12433/0:The air's clean in the medina now, and the Templars haven't seized full control there.  That's where we need to go.
12434/0:When you have eliminated the threat and spoken to JC, go outside to the abandoned VersaLife base.  I see that you have already turned on the pilot beacon.  I will be able to meet you there.
12435/0:No time to chat -- get to work.
12436/0:Lunatic!
12437/0:Thanks.  I suppose this Summit meeting must be good for business.
12438/0:Be careful of Luminon Saman.  
12439/0:I need someone to take me to the Rauchstadt neighborhood.
12440/0:At least modern aristocrats are democratically elected.  People vote with their pocketbooks.
12441/0:Time to send in a bot.
12442/0:
12443/0:Time to send in a bot.
12444/0:Time to send in a bot.
12445/0:Time to send in a bot.
12446/0:We're running out of energy here, so we're all going to have to make some sacrifices.  Survival first -- we can't justify diverting resources to any of our experiments anymore.  Namely, I think it may finally be time to stop the food supply to the grays.
12447/0:Time to send in a bot.
12448/0:Time to send in a bot.
12449/0:Time to send in a bot.
12450/0:If our enemies capture this facility, they'll learn how you were made.  Stand by us, Alex.  You're the one with combat training.  Maybe you could handle the intruders before they reach my companion and me.
12451/0:Time to send in a bot.
12452/0:My orders are to secure the lower level.
12453/0:Time to send in a bot.
12454/0:I have some subpeonaes to write.
12455/0:Time to send in a bot.
12456/0:This is not a zoo.
12457/0:I like talking to my fans.  Come back when you have something else to discuss.
12458/0:And I'm sendin' YOU to guard the ramp.  Or I tell Mr. Paladin you got shook an' hid.
12459/0:I'd give my life savings if I thought somebody could eradicate the sect entirely.
12460/0:Hey there!  I haven't seen you around here before.
12461/0:The goals of the Illuminati -- prosperity, relative freedom, social stability -- are not so baleful to humanity as you suppose.
12462/0:
12463/0:What about freedom of religion?
12464/0:Don't take long.
12465/0:Maybe later.
12466/0:
12467/0:Let's keep this deal quiet.  Cool?
12468/0:What do you think you're doing?!
12469/0:That's no religion, that's a cult.  They lure weak-minded people to their meetings, then brainwash them into terrorists.
12470/0:Not with the security grid malfunctioning.  We're fine right here.
12471/0:Alex, this is Ava Johnson.  I'm a pilot, and I've been sent to pick you up.  The signal from the beacon will let me land near the VersaLife facility, but first you must speak to JC.  I will circle the area until it's time to land.
12472/0:I just wanted to give those Order freaks what they deserve.
12473/0:Still... vandalism's a crime, right?
12474/0:
12475/0:I'll think about it.
12476/0:I cannot watch over you anymore because I am needed elsewhere.  Here is a map of the island.  Good luck, Alex.
12477/0:The canisters will transfer seed populations of nanites into subregions of your body.  You will need to configure each subpopulation for a specific skill.  For instance, the actin drivers in your legs can either increase your speed or quiet your footsteps -- not both.
12478/0:We will provide civilization with only the best leadership.
12479/0:Am I about to get jumped or something?
12480/0:Please.  Let me enjoy my holiday.
12481/0:He said I should get your help.  Perhaps we all have a common enemy now.
12482/0:The only guy with the code for the repair bot's closet is trapped on another platform.  We've also got a hazard flush system -- and we've got the code for that one -- 4781 -- but the remote access is damaged.  I'm trying to get one of these fools to go up to the balcony overlooking the bay to hit the master control, but they're afraid of crossing through the spill.
12483/0:Work with us, Alex.  If you show me I can trust you, I am prepared to privelege you like the daughter I never had.
12484/0:What's going on back there?
12485/0:Just get ready to press the button.
12486/0:They station us without any useful intel, and then wonder how we got cornered like this.
12487/0:Panzerwerks bonuses are an insult.  The Order is taking on the corrupt management on behalf of labor, hurting NO ONE, only damaging machines.
12488/0:Had any trouble with the Templars?
12489/0:Right now, the name JC Denton is a synonym for the Collapse.  In the end, though, the period of history he has set in motion will be seen as the second Enlightenment.
12490/0:
12491/0:That bot means business.  When you start to feel the ground shake, it means it's nearby.
12492/0:I'll just wait here.
12493/0:The Nassif Greenhouse is already producing food -- clean, affordable vegetables.
12494/0:She was a human being, for God's sake.
12495/0:How can you be sure?  What did you see?
12496/0:You better not be someone else trying to get into Flight Bay 24.  I've had it up to here with that today.
12497/0:Get in there!  He's going to kill them!
12498/0:The Mako facility north of town.  Who do you work for?  You mentioned a mission...
12499/0:
12500/0:Looks like you won't get any more info out of him directly.  Find his apartment and search the place for clues.  Perhaps Dr. Nassif contacted him when she arrived in Cairo.
12501/0:
12502/0:Huh.  Smug arcology brat...
12503/0:It's Panzerwerks that started the rioting.
12504/0:You tellin' me that's the World Championship greasel?  Gob fights like a pet bird!
12505/0:Unless the Templars have already convinced one of you to go through the Gate and murder JC.  Exactly.  At a minimum, they have a highly placed spy who has torn apart our organization, starting with Chicago.
12506/0:Good.  Now I'd like you to come downstairs to meet the other trainees.  Billie Adams you know from Chicago.  Check in with her in Apartment 454 on your way down.
12507/0:There are several ways to put an end to the Nassif family's illegal food production.  Destroying the filter system will kill the plants or you can destroy them directly.  You could also reprogram the software that automates the greenhouse.
12508/0:My family may now finally be safe.
12509/0:QueeQueg's is finished.  A year from now, no one -- not even the poor in the medina -- will have to drink contaminated scabland coffee.  Congratulations.  You have served the community well.
12510/0:
12511/0:That's not where it should be.
12511/1:It's clearly out of place.  People need to be more careful.
12512/0:Gah!  Someone's damaged it.
12512/1:How did it get like this?
12513/0:I'd like to see 'em try to fire me, though.
12514/0:Gah!  Someone's damaged it.
12514/1:How did it get like this?
12515/0:Are you really trying to find me a place to live in the arcology?  Don't you want to be able to see each other more often?
12516/0:It's been destroyed.
12516/1:That's a sure sign someone's up to no good.
12517/0:Remember:  Bots are programmed to neutralize any unidentified individuals.
12518/0:Right.  Well, I'll take out whoever you want for 250 credits.
12519/0:It's been destroyed.
12519/1:That's a sure sign someone's up to no good.
12520/0:The Omar are right.  It's too late for me.
12521/0:My children need to eat.
12522/0:Shut down?  That seems suspicious...
12522/1:Disabled?  I hope the repair bots get to this soon.
12523/0:What a fool.
12524/0:Shut down?  That seems suspicious...
12524/1:Disabled?  I hope the repair bots get to this soon.
12525/0:Gah!  It's gone haywire.
12525/1:Something is really wrong with that thing.
12526/0:Maybe later.
12527/0:Gah!  It's gone haywire.
12527/1:Something is really wrong with that thing.
12528/0:Admirable display of force.  You were trained well.
12529/0:This shouldn't be on.
12529/1:That's supposed to be off.
12530/0:Hey, lady.  Listen up.  Wanna scrip' some REAL cash?  You look like the mercenary type.
12531/0:You won't get away with this!
12532/0:
12533/0:I must return to my meditations now.
12534/0:Attention - All outbound flights have been delayed.  Please see the flight monitors for more information.
12535/0:Loyal seeker, your next objective is to help us find Dr. Nassif. She comes from a poor family in the plague-stricken village outside the arcology walls.  You'll have to make your way to Level 108.  Billie is waiting for you in the mosque that separates the New Cairo arcology from the village.  She'll be coordinating the operation.
12536/0:This is a pretty exclusive building, so of course we've got the best security Upper Seattle money can buy.
12537/0:When the time is right.  Right now the general populace simply isn't ready for this kind of information.  At this stage, we're only telling select individuals in the higher echelons of each organization.
12538/0:
12539/0:Sounds like a cult.
12540/0:Let's check her out.
12541/0:Thanks.  Good luck with the new branch.
12542/0:This shouldn't be on.
12542/1:That's supposed to be off.
12543/0:This is supposed to be on.
12543/1:That shouldn't be off.
12544/0:This is supposed to be on.
12544/1:That shouldn't be off.
12545/0:How did this get open?
12545/1:I'm sure that's supposed to stay closed.
12546/0:How did this get open?
12546/1:I'm sure that's supposed to stay closed.
12547/0:How did this get closed?
12547/1:I'm sure that's supposed to stay open.
12548/0:How did this get closed?
12548/1:I'm sure that's supposed to stay open.
12549/0:That's excellent news!  Apparently you didn't need it to finish the job, but you may as well take this biomod canister.  Hurry on and help JC complete his work.
12550/0:I am merely an impartial representative of Club Vox.
12551/0:Are you crazy?
12552/0:We don't appreciate outsiders hanging around.
12553/0:
12554/0:
12555/0:The WTO is wrongly equated with blind commercialism, says Dumier, just as the Order is wrongly equated with fanaticism.
12556/0:We will prepare the way.  We will lead and protect humankind.
12557/0:The bots are fine.  It's cracked processors in the housing units that have prevented me from bringing them on-line.  JC warned me that the eutactic nature of the Statue reconstruction would require him to drop the temperature, but this is quite extraordinary.
12558/0:I just came by to talk to Chief Morgan.
12559/0:I just want everything to get back to normal.
12560/0:You could tell me what a Code Yellow emergency is.  When I was talking to Dr. Nassif, a man interrupted to tell her that a security guard had been killed.
12561/0:The city of Trier, Germany is one of the oldest cities in Europe and will soon be the site of an historic meeting between the two largest political bodies to emerge since the Collapse.
12562/0:My daughter's upset over the situation in Chicago.
12563/0:(static) This is (static) the Order.  We are now in control of this facility.
12564/0:So much for their summit... heh heh
12565/0:Janice no longer works here.  Mr. Steed, this is the last "talk bullet."
12566/0:You're wasting your time down there.  You can't salvage anything for the conspirators -- they're all dead!  There's nothing left but to go to the Statue and destroy the Denton machine.
12567/0:
12568/0:
12569/0:For the time being, we will remain at Code Yellow.  We will notify citizens immediately of any change in this status.
12570/0:The commando is going to blow himself up?  Interesting.  Thanks for the tip.
12571/0:I'm the one with a perfect special-ops rating.  They didn't tell you this?  Why would they keep it a secret?
12572/0:So the research is happening all over the world?
12573/0:
12574/0:Rules is rules.
12575/0:This way and that.  Thought I could catch some business when the summit breaks up.  Seen the sights yet?  Don't mind doing local hops in between starkbier.
12576/0:So where's the factory?
12577/0:Anyone there?
12577/1:What's that?
12577/2:Eh?
12577/3:Hmmm.
12577/4:What was that?
12577/5:Something...
12577/6:Hello?.
12577/7:That's disquieting.
12578/0:The WTO's security procedures are spelled out in the Charter, in case you have any questions.  Use of incorporated zones is entirely voluntary.
12579/0:Anyone there?
12579/1:What's that?
12579/2:Eh?
12579/3:Must be imagining things.
12579/4:Did something...
12579/5:Strange...
12579/6:Huh?
12579/7:Hmm...
12579/8:Er?
12579/9:I wonder what that was.
12580/0:Anyone there?
12580/1:What's that?
12580/2:Eh?
12580/3:Now what?
12580/4:How odd.
12580/5:Disquieting.
12580/6:Could've sworn...
12580/7:Hello?
12581/0:Strange...
12581/1:Bah, now what?
12581/2:Am I getting jumpy, or is something really going on?
12581/3:Let's see now.
12581/4:Was I wrong?
12581/5:I'll see what this is.
12582/0:Strange...
12582/1:Now what?
12582/2:Am I getting jumpy?
12582/3:That's odd.
12582/4:Again?
12582/5:That's getting annoying.
12583/0:Strange...
12583/1:Bah, now what?
12583/2:Am I getting jumpy, or is something really going on?
12583/3:Suppose it's worth checking out.
12583/4:I wonder...
12584/0:That doesn't sound quite right. 
12584/1:I wonder what that sound was.
12585/0:Have a good time.
12586/0:Exactly.
12587/0:But can we trust her?
12588/0:My last gig was in Detroit.  They have one of those things on every corner.
12589/0:ApostleCorp needs me now, and I'm stuck here.
12590/0:
12591/0:I'm ready to leave as soon as the copter arrives.
12592/0:Can't afford anyone in Upper Seattle?  Don't expect to get a better deal just because you're in a scabby part of town.
12593/0:I've got some business at the SSC Station.  I'll let you know if I manage to get a look at the Evidence Room.
12594/0:Not exactly.
12595/0:Calling someone a fanatic --
12596/0:After the results of the referendum were announced on this day last year, demonstrators took to the streets, to make their anger and disapproval known.  
12597/0:The Illuminati's influence is constant and far-reaching.
12598/0:It looks like the phrenology team is going to make their deadline after all.  Get in touch with me so we can plan the next phase.
12599/0:He's already out to get me because I killed his brother.
12600/0:Exactly.  THEY do all of the choosing.  First I'm not from the right family, now they shut me out because I'm sick.  No one works their way up from Plague 11.
12601/0:I will remain with my craft.
12602/0:Yes, in order to win this war we've had to employ some of the very technologies we intend to destroy.
12603/0:Well, fly with Sid all you want -- the money gets back to me one way or another.  He's a good pilot, especially for... non-traditional jobs, if that's what you're after.  It's worth the few extra credits for a good drop point.
12604/0:Help me!
12605/0:We were given a chance to protect the world's leaders -- and failed.  SSC will never recover.
12606/0:The rich drone on about opportunity -- the poor fill their pockets with little scraps of propaganda. "Inmost Order."  "Balance."  "Cheeta Cheeta Cheeta."  What a farce!
12607/0:I'll think about it.
12608/0:It's getting to be quite a crowd down here for an impregnable fortress.  You were looking for JC Denton, too?
12609/0:
12610/0:
12611/0:
12612/0:Hold on -- no room.
12613/0:She has signed her soul over to the Luddites, the haters of technology.  Protect JC, or she could plunge the world into another Dark Age.  Trust me -- I was like her twenty years ago... and I still share some of the blame for triggering the Collapse.
12614/0:
12615/0:I'd move along if I were you.
12616/0:The critics start singing a different tune as soon as they get a chance to live in an enclave.
12617/0:I can only take so much.
12618/0:You should take the biomod canister before it is purchased by another customer.
12619/0:Sorry, I don't have enough money. [400]
12620/0:You will be followed, and we will be questioned.  Try not to make it any harder on us.
12621/0:You're startin' to push your luck.
12622/0:That blasted thing is in my path!
12622/1:It's in the way!
12623/0:That blasted thing is in my path!
12623/1:It's in the way!
12624/0:It's stuck!
12624/1:Is it locked?  Is it jammed?  Gah!
12625/0:That's what the Grand Master says.  As if these creatures' little engineered minds weren't warped enough to begin with.  Maybe they had something to do with those scientists' final ends.
12626/0:It's stuck!
12626/1:Is it locked?  Is it jammed?  Gah!
12627/0:This may slow me down... but it won't stop me.
12627/1:(grunt) Just have to give it a good shove.
12628/0:This ain't too professional, Red.
12629/0:"Tarsus continues to offer the best educational opportunities, even in this time of uncertainty." -- It was in the memo.  You DID read the whole memo, before racing down here, didn't you?
12630/0:Seems like The Order's been getting more intense lately.
12631/0:I will.
12632/0:Did you forget?  I told Commander Maxwell to give you a key to the gate in the courtyard.  Oh well -- if you'd rather fight your way through a greasel nest, I guess I can't stop you.
12633/0:I'm betting coffee's going to be big once the nanotech boom gets rolling again.
12634/0:Politicians are a specialty of mine.  Do me a favor -- quit digging through my files.
12635/0:A sign of the times.  A business conceals its name, and no one looks twice.
12636/0:
12637/0:
12637/1:
12638/0:MAN it's cold.
12639/0:I took care of the people guarding your jet.  You won't have any trouble taking it back.
12640/0:You ma'am, you look like a discriminating person.  Someone who knows innovation when she sees it.
12641/0:Everything is arranged.  Pretty soon screaming kids will be lined up around the block.
12642/0:This may slow me down... but it won't stop me.
12642/1:(grunt) Just have to give it a good shove.
12643/0:By the skull of Sidon, you shall fall before me.
12643/1:Toward Purity!
12643/2:Kneel before Baphomet!
12643/3:Prepare to meet your fate.
12643/4:Target in sight.
12643/5:We've got hostiles.
12644/0:By the skull of Sidon, you shall fall before me.
12644/1:Toward Purity!
12644/2:Kneel before Baphomet!
12644/3:Prepare to meet your fate.
12645/0:You will contaminate humanity no more, you fiend.
12645/1:Purity will prevail. 
12645/2:Your time on this earth is limited, freak. 
12645/3:You're dead, freak!
12646/0:You will contaminate humanity no more, you fiend.
12646/1:Purity will prevail.
12646/2:Your time on this earth is limited, freak.  
12647/0:Prepare to meet your end at our hands, freak.
12648/0:Prepare to meet your end at our hands, freak.
12649/0:They're everywhere. And they're growling.
12650/0:We will crush this incubus.
12651/0:We will crush this incubus.
12652/0:We will crush this succubus.
12653/0:
12654/0:Tarsus -- oh, well, we don't know anything about the trials.  Don't tell me there's been an escape.  I warned Dr. Nassif.  I said that if she wasn't careful they'd end up with a JC Denton on their hands.
12655/0:You'd be calling attention to yourself.  That what you want?
12656/0:It won't be long now.
12657/0:We will crush this succubus.
12658/0:This disgusting freak must not be permitted to survive.
12659/0:This disgusting freak must not be permitted to survive.
12660/0:I do not know what the Templars are planning, but I know it cannot be good.
12661/0:Eliminate that transgenic freak.
12662/0:Eliminate that transgenic freak.
12663/0:Excellent work as usual, Lt. Archer.  You will be pleased to hear, in turn, that we have seized the ApostleCorp facility.  It was right under our noses, on Level 108.  Transmitting the suite's softkey ID so that you can join us at your leisure.
12664/0:I must destroy this greasel.
12665/0:I must destroy this greasel.
12666/0:I must destroy this greasel.
12667/0:Unfortunately, the coffee business is very low-margin.  We will have to agree on a trade for the biomod.  If you succeed, the central office will negotiate NG's fee.
12668/0:I must destroy this greasel.
12669/0:I must eliminate this karkian.
12670/0:Not going to let you by this time, Alex.  I didn't know you were so squeamish about combat, until I saw how you handled Antarctica.  You said you'd kill me but I guess you didn't have the heart.  This time we'll finish it.
12671/0:
12672/0:That's Shutterbug under the floor.  Raised her from a little pup.
12673/0:Lovely.  I need to get out of town, too.  Get in.
12674/0:Did you hear something?
12675/0:Did you hear something?
12676/0:Something like that.
12677/0:Am I crazy?  Did you just see something?
12678/0:Am I crazy?  Did you just see something?
12679/0:That's what you think.
12680/0:Am I crazy?  Did you just see something?
12681/0:Activate the nodes, reconnect him with the waking.  But beware:  the other key has made her own plans.
12682/0:I'm sure I just saw something -- did you?
12683/0:I must eliminate this karkian.
12684/0:I'm sure I just saw something -- did you?
12685/0:I must eliminate this karkian.
12686/0:I'm sure I just saw something -- did you?
12687/0:I must eliminate this karkian.
12688/0:Now you'll have to deal with me too.
12688/1:Start something with one -- make an enemy of us all.
12688/2:Someone dares challenge a Templar?
12688/3:Need a hand with that fool?
12688/4:I'd like to join in.
12688/5:I back up my brethren.
12688/6:But can you handle both of us?
12689/0:Who's responsible for this?
12690/0:Vile beast!  Begone!
12691/0:Now you'll have to deal with me too.
12691/1:Start something with one -- make an enemy of us all.
12691/2:Someone dares challenge a Templar?
12691/3:Need a hand with that fool?
12691/4:I'd like to join in.
12691/5:I back up my brethren.
12691/6:But can you handle both of us?
12692/0:Who's responsible for this?
12693/0:Vile beast!  Begone!
12694/0:Speak with the trader.  I am only here to observe.  And protect.
12695/0:By the skull of Sidon, you shall fall before me this time.
12695/1:Now, we'll finish this.
12696/0:Thanks for taking the job.  I don't know what the Director was going to do next.
12697/0:By the skull of Sidon, you shall fall before me this time.
12697/1:Now, we'll finish this.
12698/0:I will be victorious this time.
12698/1:You're in for it now.
12698/2:You want some more?
12698/3:Still standing, huh?
12698/4:This'll finish you.
12699/0:I will be victorious this time.
12699/1:You're in for it now.
12700/0:Don't worry -- I'm outta here as soon as the Inclinator's back in business.
12701/0:What about them?
12702/0:You're not getting away from us again.
12703/0:Sorry, plum cake.  I can't do much until I get my wings back.
12704/0:Not life-threatening.  Paul is no weaker than any man cured of a serious disease.  With your continued help, we will build a synthetic immune system for all of us.
12705/0:If the Order isn't territorial, why do you maintain an armed guard?
12706/0:Hey, lady.  I just heard from Eddie downstairs.  He can stall a little while longer if you need more time to... you know.
12707/0:Wish I had more cash.  I'd bet more.  [250 credits.]
12708/0:I don't have a problem with you being here.  Just be careful.
12709/0:Excellent -- you made it out.  Now you see why most cities have a transgenics problem.  A dozen laboratories like this were abandoned all around the world...
12710/0:We cannot allow JC to continue to sleep.
12711/0:There's no turning back after Phase II.  I'd be almost invincible with cyborg hardware plus the Tarsus biomods, but...  this stuff's not like a nanite infusion.  I'm still sore from the transskeletal supports I already have.
12712/0:We will bring you more details as they become available.
12713/0:Who's responsible for this?
12714/0:Why is this off?
12715/0:I'm not afraid to.
12716/0:Why is this off?
12717/0:Why is this off?
12718/0:I hate Calculus.
12719/0:Why is this open?
12720/0:They have driven the SSC troops back and have set up their own bases and patrols.  In the mosque alone, they have regular troops, some guys in weird armor, and even a bot.  
12721/0:Why is this open?
12722/0:Why is this open?
12723/0:Ha.  Doesn't hurt.
12724/0:Huh?
12724/1:Eh?
12724/2:Oh?
12725/0:Why is this closed?
12726/0:Why is this closed?
12727/0:I don't have the credits for the scrambler grenades. [300]
12728/0:Why is this closed?
12729/0:Good, you found the facility.  Transmit the specification to the WTO orbiting science platform, Ophelia, then you will be free to kill that self-styled Savior, J.C. Denton.
12730/0:I don't understand...
12731/0:I know we can hold out, but only for so long.
12732/0:What do you mean?
12733/0:State your business.
12734/0:Leo Jankowski?  I went to school with that guy -- briefly.
12735/0:And...?
12736/0:Any idea what's spooking the animals?
12737/0:Any idea what's spooking the animals?
12738/0:I don't know what Paul's status is, but I'm sure any resources you've got would be useful.
12739/0:Where does m'lady wanna fly?
12740/0:I've got to find the person responsible for this -- any leads?
12741/0:I've got to find the person responsible for this -- any leads?
12742/0:I don't know what I'll finally decide about the WTO, but it's hard to pass up a chance to play a role in such a monumental project.
12743/0:You better go.
12744/0:I've got to find the person responsible for this -- any leads?
12745/0:What's in Trier?
12746/0:A Templar?  No.
12747/0:Oh God -- I've got to find the murderer -- any leads?
12748/0:Look at this funhouse.  I guess it's some sort of architectural photo album.  This room is from Hong Kong -- where JC Denton went into hiding for a while.  Talk about ego.  Is this what you want to bring about -- the whole world recreated in his image?
12749/0:Oh God -- I've got to find the murderer -- any leads?
12750/0:Yes.  Missionaries.
12751/0:Oh God -- I've got to find the murderer -- any leads?
12752/0:How I wish we could go on talking.
12753/0:Check around over there.
12753/1:Take a look over that way.
12754/0:We must return the safeness to this area.
12755/0:Well done.  Now you'll have to unlock that door.  Shouldn't take more than one multitool, or you could always just blow it up, if you aren't afraid of attracting guards.
12756/0:Harmless missionaries at the train station?  Or sleeper agents for a regime fundamentally opposed to commercial society?
12757/0:The failure in this case of the aerostat perimeter doesn't --
12758/0:You're lucky to have someone like that looking after your interests.
12759/0:Excellent negotiations.
12760/0:I don't know....  Some kind of reactor or something.
12761/0:Guess I'll find my pilot and consider your request.
12762/0:Sometimes High Augur Chen has her head in the clouds.
12763/0:Check around over there.
12763/1:Take a look over that way.
12764/0:Check around over there.
12764/1:Take a look over that way.
12765/0:I don't know.  I think I saw someone over there.
12765/1:I think I saw something over there.
12766/0:I don't know.  I think I saw someone over there.
12766/1:I think I saw something over there.
12767/0:I don't know.  I think I saw someone over there.
12767/1:I think I saw something over there.
12768/0:Thanks for checking into all that.
12769/0:There was a strange woman around.  I just saw her over there.
12770/0:I'll have more influence on the WTO from inside the ranks.
12771/0:There was a strange woman around.  I just saw her over there.
12772/0:We're trapped!  I can't believe SSC Command let us get into this mess.
12773/0:
12774/0:There was a strange woman around.  I just saw her over there.
12775/0:Sorry, I really don't have that many credits on me. [150]
12776/0:There was a strange man around.  I just saw him over there.
12777/0:There was a strange man around.  I just saw him over there.
12778/0:Of course, they don't tell ME anything.  They just needed a sharpshooter to verify the real-world usability.
12779/0:You have been deceived, tired pilgrim.  I destroyed the entire city of Chicago only because the threat from ApostleCorp warranted such desperate tactics.  Come to the holocomm in Tent 04.  It's time you learned the truth about your past.
12780/0:I guess I'm out of questions at the moment.
12781/0:We can handle them, no problem.
12782/0:So how does it feel?  Your life's work is a phony conflict between business and idealism in the minds of billions of people.
12783/0:You really have cockfights with transgenics down here?
12784/0:QueeQueg's is finished.  A year from now, no one -- not even the poor in the medina -- will have to drink contaminated scabland coffee.  Congratulations.  You have served the community well.
12785/0:I guess Max got his fill of action today.
12786/0:Thank you.  The authorities will be informed.
12787/0:The WTO could really use an agent like you, and we could offer you a kind of mobility no one else can.
12788/0:Good, you found the facility.  Transmit the specification to the WTO orbiting science platform, Ophelia, then you will be free to kill that self-styled Savior and destroy his illegal machine.
12789/0:No way, man.  I think they already got her with a barrel or a crate.
12790/0:Good work, Tarsus man.  Here's your compensation.  I wonder what lucky corporations get to hire the Tarsus grads.
12791/0:They're making us do security drills at the academy.
12792/0:There was a strange man around.  I just saw him over there.
12793/0:
12794/0:There were some strange noises coming from that way.
12795/0:You will appreciate our merchandise.  You are a welcome customer, having helped us in the past.  Perhaps you can offer your services once more.
12796/0:There were some strange noises coming from that way.
12797/0:I'm gonna do it.  You can't talk me out of it.
12798/0:There were some strange noises coming from that way.
12799/0:
12800/0:I was attacked by some strange guy -- then he took off.
12801/0:I was attacked by some strange guy -- then he took off.
12802/0:I was attacked by some strange guy -- then he took off.
12803/0:Information not relevant.
12804/0:
12804/1:
12804/2:
12804/3:
12804/4:
12805/0:I was attacked by some strange woman -- then she took off.
12806/0:I was attacked by some strange woman -- then she took off.
12807/0:I was attacked by some strange woman -- then she took off.
12808/0:Just going for a walk.
12809/0:Maybe you should follow me to Antarctica.  Billie would hardly be a match for both of us.
12810/0:Strangers welcome.  Just don't make any speeches.
12811/0:You've done well so far.  Just don't let me down.
12812/0:Maybe that's where Dr. Nassif is hiding out.
12813/0:What?
12814/0:How so?
12815/0:In arcologies, you mean.  We present our message where it will do the most good -- in the enclaves of scientists, businessmen, engineers -- the blind minions of Thanatos.
12816/0:He's pinned down in the Inclinator right now, negotiating with the authorities for safe passage out of Seattle.  I want you to infiltrate the facility and learn what you can about this betrayal.  Then perhaps we will be closer to understanding his actions at Tarsus Academy.
12817/0:Indeed, the people here are very devout.
12818/0:Everyone, as far as I can tell.
12819/0:Exchange completed.
12820/0:Intel says you're taking down your fair share of Order troublemakers.  Good to have someone like you on our side.
12821/0:Thank you.  I'd almost given up hope.  This morning I lost my daughter Mina to the plague.  I was here to claim the body when the Templars attacked.
12822/0:Aquinas waits for your direction.
12823/0:Something bumped into me when I was over there.
12824/0:Something bumped into me when I was over there.
12825/0:Something bumped into me when I was over there.
12826/0:Sorry.
12826/1:Nope.
12826/2:Haven't noticed a thing.
12827/0:Sorry.
12827/1:Nope.
12827/2:Haven't noticed a thing.
12828/0:This city is lost.  Toxic air and a fanatic group enforcing a military state.
12829/0:Sorry.
12829/1:Nope.
12829/2:Haven't noticed a thing.
12830/0:Good day.
12830/1:Greetings.
12831/0:That's a lovely mess you've made down there.  You've put me in a bind, Alex.  It's critical that I try to recruit you to our cause, but to be honest I would like nothing more right now than for one of my troopers to put a bullet in the back of your head.
12832/0:Good day.
12832/1:Greetings.
12833/0:Good day.
12833/1:Greetings.
12834/0:Hello.
12834/1:Good day.
12835/0:Not in my job description.  Tell you what -- since it looks like the specialist is a no-show, I'll give you his fee if you take care of the job.  And I'll look the other way if some of the science stuff disappears.  A greasel must've eaten it, you know?
12836/0:Nothing to see here.
12837/0:
12838/0:You are lost, my friend.  The tavern's clear on the other side of town -- to the west.
12839/0:Complete your objective and a new day will dawn for humankind.
12840/0:I hope I don't miss my connection.
12841/0:You're wasting your time down there.  You can't salvage anything for the conspirators -- they're all dead!  There's nothing left but to go to the Statue and destroy the Denton machine.
12842/0:The important thing is to rebuild.  Then we can stop fixating on the Collapse and get back to normal lives.
12843/0:You sir, you look like a discriminating person.  Someone who knows innovation when he sees it.
12844/0:All that, and then no real conflict in getting the pilot to land. 
12845/0:Punk?!
12846/0:You're nearing the toxic spill the facility director told you about.  The WTO is reaping the benefits of its harmful industries -- I guess a little pollution is all in a day's work up there.  The area's been closed off and they've deployed bots to patrol and secure it.  May Her Holiness watch over you as you face these obstacles.
12847/0:I'm on someone's trail -- seen anyone?
12848/0:I'm on someone's trail -- seen anyone?
12849/0:Enough interruptions.
12850/0:I'm on someone's trail -- seen anyone?
12851/0:Where?
12852/0:The purpose of the raid is now clear -- the Templars have taken our leader hostage.  They seem to be maintaining life support, but for how long?  We were supposed to protect him and awaken him once we found the cure.  How could we let this happen?
12853/0:I'm on someone's trail -- seen anyone?
12854/0:I'm on someone's trail -- seen anyone?
12855/0:Hello.
12855/1:Good day.
12856/0:I'm on someone's trail -- seen anyone?
12857/0:Hello.
12857/1:Good day.
12858/0:As long as I'm on the other side of the ocean when that happens.
12859/0:I'm on someone's trail -- seen anyone?
12860/0:Isn't this news about Chicago just mind-boggling?
12860/1:Can you believe what they're saying about the Order?
12861/0:I'm on someone's trail -- seen anyone?
12862/0:Isn't this news about Chicago just mind-boggling?
12862/1:Can you believe what they're saying about the Order?
12863/0:I'm on someone's trail -- seen anyone?
12864/0:Isn't this news about Chicago just mind-boggling?
12864/1:Can you believe what they're saying about the Order?
12865/0:I'm on someone's trail -- seen anyone?
12866/0:I'm busy right now.
12866/1:Can't say I care.
12867/0:I'm busy right now.
12867/1:Can't say I care.
12868/0:I'm busy right now.
12868/1:Can't say I care.
12869/0:
12869/1:
12870/0:Hmph.  People today.
12870/1:Really?
12871/0:Hmph.  People today.
12871/1:Really?
12872/0:Just kidding.  Listen, I'm serious.  You didn't hear the explosions?  I saw a guard killed right in front of me on the apartment level.
12873/0:Cozying up to the WTO, eh?
12874/0:As you wish.
12875/0:A black-market biomod would be great, if I could afford it.  [1000]
12876/0:Just let me in.
12877/0:
12878/0:I'm on someone's trail -- seen anyone?
12879/0:I'm on someone's trail -- seen anyone?
12880/0:Strange.  Any ideas?
12881/0:Strange.  Any ideas?
12882/0:Strange.  Any ideas?
12883/0:Hmph.  People today.
12883/1:Really?
12884/0:Go now.  I have preparations to make.
12885/0:Commander Maxwell wants the access restrictions fully enforced, and I'm not risking my job by bending the rules.
12886/0:Strange.  Any ideas?
12887/0:Get out of my face.
12887/1:I've got better things to do.
12888/0:Strange.  Any ideas?
12889/0:Get out of my face.
12889/1:I've got better things to do.
12890/0:Strange.  Any ideas?
12891/0:Get out of my face.
12891/1:I've got better things to do.
12892/0:I'm not shedding any tears over Headmaster Archer, but you should notify the SSC about him so that they can take care of the situation.  There is a security kiosk on this level outside the school.
12893/0:Why would the Templars bother with capture?  I hate to be so blunt, but it seems that elimination would make more sense.
12894/0:Strange.  Any ideas?
12895/0:I am not amused.
12895/1:You must have something else to do right now.
12895/2:I'd appreciate it if you'd stop that.
12896/0:We can have jobs and sustainability at the same time.  We tried to make this point in our peaceful protests, according to Luminon Saman's orders.
12897/0:Strange.  Any ideas?
12898/0:I am not amused.
12898/1:You must have something else to do right now.
12898/2:I'd appreciate it if you'd stop that.
12899/0:I am not amused.
12899/1:You must have something else to do right now.
12899/2:I'd appreciate it if you'd stop that.
12900/0:Please get away from me.
12900/1:Keep your hands to yourself.
12900/2:Pay more attention to where you're going.
12901/0:Please get away from me.
12901/1:Keep your hands to yourself.
12901/2:Pay more attention to where you're going.
12902/0:Please get away from me.
12902/1:Keep your hands to yourself.
12902/2:Pay more attention to where you're going.
12903/0:They'll probably make a bundle, too.  So that's why they dropped out of sight?
12904/0:Everyone is a price.  A price you can get, a price you must pay.  Very simple.
12905/0:Can I trust you?
12906/0:You know I can't.
12907/0:Trier is your home.  Surely you must have some insight into why they would kidnap your lady, Her Holiness.  She is practically a patron saint in this district.
12908/0:Mmm, what do I see?  An exceptional young woman.  Modified, correct?  Lovingly grown in an enclave -- and now you step into the dangerous world.
12909/0:Who has time to worry about terrorists in the arcology?  The medina is free!  The plague is over!
12910/0:You are a truly evil man.  You are awakening a being of such power that the human race will have no choice but to kneel before it -- unless we can turn its power to our own purposes.  May God give you the wisdom to right your crooked path.
12911/0:Interesting -- Is he sure?  We've noticed some Templar activity on the north side of town.
12912/0:Don't you have any hazmat workers or bots to take care of it?
12913/0:Strange.  Any ideas?
12914/0:You have your orders.  Proceed.
12915/0:Strange.  Any ideas?
12916/0:Strange.  Any ideas?
12917/0:Strange.  Any ideas?
12918/0:Don't be naive.  Think about everything you've seen and heard.  It will all become clear to you.
12919/0:I wonder if they roughed him up before they took him away.  I kinda hope so...
12920/0:Check around over there.
12920/1:Take a look over that way.
12920/2:I think something's going on over there.
12921/0:Do you realize whom you're assaulting?
12921/1:I'm not afraid of you and your petty attacks.
12921/2:I will call security if you keep this up.
12922/0:I think that the whole organization is about to unravel.
12923/0:You had better take another look at the main chamber.  You were just teleported almost a half a mile.  I'm not surprised, though.  I was able to construct the Black Gate teleporter only with instructions from Helios.
12924/0:Check around over there.
12924/1:Take a look over that way.
12924/2:I think something's going on over there.
12925/0:Do you realize whom you're assaulting?
12925/1:I'm not afraid of you and your petty attacks.
12925/2:I will call security if you keep this up.
12926/0:Check around over there.
12926/1:Take a look over that way.
12926/2:I think something's going on over there.
12927/0:Do you realize whom you're assaulting?
12927/1:I'm not afraid of you and your petty attacks.
12927/2:I will call security if you keep this up.
12928/0:Check around over there.
12928/1:Take a look over that way.
12928/2:I think something's going on over there.
12929/0:It's not polite to stare.
12929/1:I wish you wouldn't look at me like that.
12929/2:I don't really enjoy being studied like this.
12930/0:Do I look like him?
12931/0:Check around over there.
12931/1:Take a look over that way.
12931/2:I think something's going on over there.
12932/0:It's not polite to stare.
12932/1:I wish you wouldn't look at me like that.
12932/2:I don't really enjoy being 
12932/3:You're staring.
12933/0:The transgenic tissue scan you recovered from Club Vox is already producing improvements in Omar survivability.
12934/0:Check around over there.
12934/1:Take a look over that way.
12934/2:I think something's going on over there.
12935/0:It's not polite to stare.
12935/1:I wish you wouldn't look at me like that.
12935/2:I don't really enjoy being studied like this.
12936/0:You're acting awfully strange...
12936/1:Enough with this nonsense.
12936/2:Stop goofing around and move along already.
12937/0:You're acting awfully strange...
12937/1:Enough with this nonsense.
12937/2:Stop goofing around and move along already.
12938/0:
12939/0:You're acting awfully strange...
12939/1:Enough with this nonsense.
12939/2:Stop goofing around and move along already.
12940/0:No need to get drastic.
12940/1:Hey, hey, we're all friends here...
12940/2:Watch it!
12941/0:
12942/0:
12943/0:Damn it!  I'll stop you myself.
12944/0:Right behind you.
12945/0:Tough luck, D.  The Pit appreciates the business, though.
12946/0:Think like that, and they already got you scrip'ed, man.  That's their play -- make out like it was some Low-town plot and see how we react.
12947/0:Yeah.
12948/0:
12949/0:I've been thinking about this.  I don't want to be a lab monkey or be in anybody's army.  I don't want to be a piece of meat they fight over.  Corporate heavy, maybe.  But right now I work for myself.
12950/0:You are obviously not from around here.
12951/0:Check around over there.
12951/1:Take a look over that way.
12951/2:I think something's going on over there.
12952/0:They left behind one of the Tarsus Directors.  I don't think they're going to leave us high and dry.
12953/0:
12954/0:Check around over there.
12954/1:Take a look over that way.
12954/2:I think something's going on over there.
12955/0:Check around over there.
12955/1:Take a look over that way.
12955/2:I think something's going on over there.
12956/0:Check around over there.
12956/1:Take a look over that way.
12956/2:I think something's going on over there.
12957/0:Check around over there.
12957/1:Take a look over that way.
12957/2:I think something's going on over there.
12958/0:No need to get drastic.
12958/1:Hey, hey, we're all friends here...
12958/2:Watch it!
12959/0:Check around over there.
12959/1:Take a look over that way.
12959/2:I think something's going on over there.
12960/0:No need to get drastic.
12960/1:Hey, hey, we're all friends here...
12960/2:Watch it!
12961/0:You really have cockfights with transgenics down here?
12962/0:Nope.
12962/1:Haven't noticed a thing.
12962/2:Nothing unusual here.
12963/0:You're trespassing.
12963/1:This area's restricted.
12963/2:I seriously doubt you're authorized to be here.
12964/0:Nope.
12964/1:Haven't noticed a thing.
12964/2:Nothing unusual here.
12965/0:You're trespassing.
12965/1:This area's restricted.
12965/2:I seriously doubt you're authorized to be here.
12966/0:Nope.
12966/1:Haven't noticed a thing.
12966/2:Nothing unusual here.
12967/0:You're trespassing.
12967/1:This area's restricted.
12967/2:I seriously doubt you're authorized to be here.
12968/0:Nope.
12968/1:Haven't noticed a thing.
12968/2:Nothing unusual here.
12969/0:Have some respect!
12969/1:Find a different way to amuse yourself.
12969/2:I don't appreciate this.
12970/0:I guess I just got swept up in the excitement.
12971/0:
12972/0:Have some respect!
12972/1:Find a different way to amuse yourself.
12972/2:I don't appreciate this.
12973/0:Have some respect!
12973/1:Find a different way to amuse yourself.
12973/2:I don't appreciate this.
12974/0:Keep your hands to yourself.
12974/1:Stay away from me.
12974/2:I won't stand for this disrespect.
12975/0:Keep your hands to yourself.
12975/1:Stay away from me.
12975/2:I won't stand for this disrespect.
12976/0:You must find another Omar, in another city perhaps, to do business.
12977/0:Do the Omar think they're starting a utopia?
12978/0:I don't live in the arcology.
12979/0:Thank God -- someone from the outside.  I'd make a run for the medina if the floor of the mosque could be secured, but no one will fight.  Seekers.  SSC.  They've all vanished.
12980/0:Rather adventurous of me to trust you, isn't it?  I haven't even read your file yet.
12981/0:It's you!  This time I'll make sure you don't walk away.
12982/0:If it was up to them, this place would never turn a profit.
12983/0:Don't worry.  I have this area sewed up.
12984/0:A lot of down-and-outs around here are signing up for this Templar outfit.  Me?  I take everything with a grain of salt.
12985/0:Here's some money to cover the loss, provided I can hire him myself.  [250]
12986/0:
12987/0:I never wanted to send any of our children away for school, but without education a child is helpless.
12988/0:Think about it -- it's a much better deal, and no blood on your hands.
12989/0:Enjoy your new technologies.
12990/0:Sorry, you're on your own.
12991/0:Nope.
12991/1:Haven't noticed a thing.
12991/2:Nothing unusual here.
12992/0:If you get called in for an interview, you might think about sprucing up your wardrobe.
12993/0:Nope.
12993/1:Haven't noticed a thing.
12993/2:Nothing unusual here.
12994/0:Nope.
12994/1:Haven't noticed a thing.
12994/2:Nothing unusual here.
12995/0:I guess you just need to know the right people to get anything done.
12996/0:Nope.
12996/1:Haven't noticed a thing.
12996/2:Nothing unusual here.
12997/0:Nope.
12997/1:Haven't noticed a thing.
12997/2:Nothing unusual here.
12998/0:Nope.
12998/1:Haven't noticed a thing.
12998/2:Nothing unusual here.
12999/0:Nope.
12999/1:Haven't noticed a thing.
12999/2:Nothing unusual here.
13000/0:Quit wasting my time.
13001/0:Nope.
13001/1:Haven't noticed a thing.
13001/2:Nothing unusual here.
13002/0:How's it going?
13002/1:How are you?
13003/0:It's for real, then?  You came through?  My lawyer just called a minute ago -- I thought he was kidding.
13004/0:How's it going?
13004/1:How are you?
13005/0:That's very kind.  (sniffle)  But unless you're on the admissions committee at the academy -- or unless you're someone who can hack in and put "Mina Ameer" on the acceptance list, there's not really much to do except wait and pray.
13006/0:Phew.  I'm glad I didn't have to take care of it.
13007/0:
13008/0:
13009/0:Whole world's divided up into crazies and more crazies.
13010/0:Your niece Leila and I work together.  It's the least I could do.
13011/0:I've been talking with their High Augur, Lin May Chen. There was some miscommunication about the raid but the main objectives were still accomplished.  They showed us what was really going on behind the scenes and freed us.  I'm grateful, and you should be too.
13012/0:I heard you activated the beacon.  Thanks.  
13013/0:How's it going?
13013/1:How are you?
13014/0:How's it going?
13014/1:How are you?
13015/0:Well, apparently they can get you inside an arcology facility where there's proof.  Personally, I'm not going to waste my time saving the planet until we figure out where Dr. Nassif is hiding.
13016/0:How are you?
13016/1:How's it going?
13017/0:I checked out the public terminal.  Looks like we got out of Chicago just in time.
13018/0:No more interruptions, please.
13019/0:How's it going?
13019/1:How are you?
13020/0:How's it going?
13020/1:How are you?
13021/0:How's it going?
13021/1:How are you?
13022/0:People are mad.  Sewer gobs killin' their kids, pollution, nanite swells as big as hurricanes, cyborgs in the alleys -- all fallout from the big labs.
13023/0:How's it going?
13023/1:How are you?
13024/0:I'm sure you have everything under control.
13025/0:How's it going?
13025/1:How are you?
13026/0:How's it going?
13026/1:How are you?
13027/0:How's it going?
13027/1:How are you?
13028/0:I programmed these units myself.
13029/0:I don't believe we've met.
13030/0:
13031/0:Don't worry about my safety.  Just help me get back into the air.
13032/0:Intruders are storming the facility.  Evacuate immediately.
13033/0:You had better take another look at the main chamber.  You were just teleported almost a half a mile.  I'm not surprised, though.  I was able to construct the Black Gate teleporter only with instructions from Helios.
13034/0:The Order -- Hmpf!  Tree-hugging pansies...
13035/0:But whose police force?
13036/0:I'll let a bot take care of this.
13037/0:I'll let a bot take care of this.
13038/0:I'll let a bot take care of this.
13039/0:I'll let a bot take care of this.
13040/0:Warning -- Mako facility security has been compromised.
13041/0:Hi.
13041/1:Hey there.
13042/0:I'll let a bot take care of this.
13043/0:Hi.
13043/1:Hey there.
13044/0:I'll let a bot take care of this.
13045/0:This is what the Illuminati wants you to do.  Destroy Paul Denton and help return biomod technology to international regulation.  Please discuss the operation with the Elite Commando waiting for you in the street.  Paul's frozen body is located in Flight Bay 24 on Level 110 of the arcology.
13046/0:What happened?  How did the Templars manage to take the arcology?
13047/0:Hi.
13047/1:Hey there.
13048/0:I'll let a bot take care of this.
13049/0:He is lucky you came along when you did.
13050/0:Hi.
13050/1:Hey there.
13051/0:I'll let a bot take care of this.
13052/0:Suit yourself.
13053/0:Hello.
13053/1:Hey there.
13054/0:I'll let a bot take care of this.
13055/0:What about you?
13056/0:The defense of commercial districts has been the key to economic recovery since the Collapse.
13057/0:Hi.
13057/1:Hey there.
13058/0:I'll let a bot take care of this.
13059/0:Hi.
13059/1:Hey there.
13060/0:The only honest form of government is one that responds to the opinions of the people every second of the day.
13061/0:The Code Yellow health advisory for Old Cairo remains in effect.  Like last year at this time, we are anticipating an upgrade to red over the course of the next few weeks.  
13062/0:Hi.
13062/1:Hey there.
13063/0:This has been another... ta-a-alk BULLET!
13064/0:Hi.
13064/1:Hey there.
13065/0:I did some investigating.  Mr. Dumier thinks he can sacrifice Cairo in the short term, but he has sent his personal bodyguard, an elite commando, to kill an enemy of his being held in the arcology by the Templars.
13066/0:Hi.
13066/1:Hey there.
13067/0:Alex.  I just talked to Dr. Nassif.  Know anything about a Code Yellow emergency?  A security guard has been murdered.
13068/0:We can't just walk away from this.
13069/0:They cannot be so wicked as that.  No one chooses to live in the medina.
13070/0:Your actions in Antarctica prove you're honorable -- you let me go and didn't shoot me in the back.  I've realized that we've known each other too long to let others order us to assassinate each other.  I'm supposed to keep this area secure, and I intend to take down anyone else who comes by, but you're free to go, Alex.
13071/0:You now have the Templar army behind you.
13072/0:
13073/0:
13074/0:Something like that.
13075/0:I'll let a bot take care of this.
13076/0:Now if you'll excuse me, I'm expecting a visitor.
13077/0:I'll let a bot take care of this.
13078/0:Ma'am.
13079/0:Later, dude.
13080/0:Head down, Claw!  Head down!
13081/0:Hi.
13081/1:Hey there.
13082/0:Hi.
13082/1:Hey there.
13083/0:Doesn't this stuff with the Order just burn you up?
13083/1:Wanna get together later?
13084/0:You don't strike me as the religious type.
13085/0:Doesn't this stuff with the Order just burn you up?
13085/1:Wanna get together later?
13086/0:Burn in hell!
13087/0:Doesn't this stuff with the Order just burn you up?
13087/1:Wanna get together later?
13088/0:You made a big mistake by crossing Mr. O'Rourke.
13089/0:Doesn't this stuff with the Order just burn you up?
13089/1:Wanna get together later?
13090/0:We shouldn't have... relied on these things!  Oh God!
13091/0:Does this stuff with the Order not just burn you up?
13091/1:Would you like to get together later?
13092/0:Doesn't this stuff with the Order just burn you up?
13092/1:Wanna get together later?
13093/0:Doesn't this stuff with the Order just burn you up?
13093/1:Wanna get together later?
13094/0:Doesn't this stuff with the Order just burn you up?
13094/1:Wanna get together later?
13095/0:You were sincere.
13096/0:This is more than I ever bargained for.
13097/0:So where's the factory?
13098/0:Ha-ha...!  Red sure run a drag on THAT uptown feeb...
13099/0:I took care of the assassins upstairs.  You don't have anything to fear from them.
13100/0:
13101/0:And the plague lasted for years.
13102/0:
13103/0:Take it out!  It's been corrupted.
13104/0:Eye for an eye!
13104/1:So this is the one that did it.
13104/2:Your turn to die!
13104/3:You dare murder a Knight...?
13105/0:Which side were you on?
13106/0:Right.  What was I thinkin'?
13107/0:Meanwhile, I owe Upper Seattle SSC a hundred units.
13108/0:What did he do to you?
13109/0:Doesn't this stuff with the Order just burn you up?
13109/1:Wanna get together later?
13110/0:Check the whole place.
13110/1:Keep looking - we're not done yet.
13110/2:Keep at it.  No one gets away.
13111/0:Ever since she didn't get into the Tarsus Academy, her infection has been getting worse.  She should be up on Level 107 right now, in her own dorm room, studying and breathing filtered air.  She's always been such a... good student... (sobs)
13112/0:Doesn't this stuff with the Order just burn you up?
13112/1:Wanna get together later?
13113/0:We'll find him.  How far could he go?
13113/1:Did you get a good look at him?
13114/0:Doesn't this stuff with the Order just burn you up?
13114/1:Wanna get together later?
13115/0:Don't let her get behind you.
13115/1:Which way was she moving?
13116/0:Doesn't this stuff with the Order just burn you up?
13116/1:Wanna get together later?
13117/0:Don't think so.
13117/1:Try someone else.
13118/0:Got him.  Who needs mods?
13119/0:Don't think so.
13119/1:Try someone else.
13120/0:Got her.  Who needs mods?
13121/0:Don't think so.
13121/1:Try someone else.
13122/0:Don't think so.
13122/1:Try someone else.
13123/0:Don't think so.
13123/1:Try someone else.
13124/0:Don't think so.
13124/1:Try someone else.
13125/0:Strangers welcome.  Just don't make any speeches.
13126/0:It's a decent crowd tonight.
13127/0:Well, it looks like they did.
13128/0:
13129/0:
13130/0:Good idea.  By the way, Chief Morgan wanted me to give you this biomod canister -- a reward for securing the Mag Rail plans at Mako.
13131/0:test
13132/0:I have always wondered what they do in there...
13133/0:Gotta coach my gob.
13134/0:I'll leave you to your scheming.
13135/0:I've seen terrorist groups before.  They lay out a lot of money for weapons, but they don't have any depth.  The run out of food, ammo, morale... then poof! -- they're gone.
13136/0:Sender replied:
13137/0:If it wasn't for joining the WTO, Seattle would still be a post-Collapse fishing village.
13138/0:Don't think so.
13138/1:Try someone else.
13139/0:Alex, the grays are no threat to you -- they are allied with JC.  Your focus should be gaining access to JC's sanctuary and reviving him.  You might want to talk to that gray for more details.
13140/0:Tourists are not welcome here.
13141/0:Don't think so.
13141/1:Try someone else.
13142/0:Don't think so.
13142/1:Try someone else.
13143/0:Gotta show this thing who's boss.
13144/0:May Order return, my friend.
13145/0:That's why we're under lockdown and curfew now.  Trying to stamp out the last bits of the Panzerwerks riot.
13146/0:Don't think so.
13146/1:Try someone else.
13147/0:Gotta show this thing who's boss.
13148/0:You may have a few pieces, but I doubt you can see the whole picture.
13149/0:Don't think so.
13149/1:Try someone else.
13150/0:Gotta show this thing who's boss.
13151/0:Don't think so.
13151/1:Try someone else.
13152/0:Gotta show this thing who's boss.
13153/0:What's your problem?
13153/1:Sheesh.
13154/0:A stupid thing to do.
13155/0:What's your problem?
13155/1:Sheesh.
13156/0:What's your problem?
13156/1:Sheesh.
13157/0:What's your problem?
13157/1:Sheesh.
13158/0:What about the SSC?
13159/0:Oh, sure.  That was the luxury terminal where my jet used to land.  I never understood why the city closed it.
13160/0:Sorry your greasel didn't win.
13161/0:
13162/0:That's right.  We're supposed to be standing guard.  Got a problem with that?
13163/0:
13164/0:
13165/0:That old base really creeps me out.  I don't even want to think about what kind of experiments they were doing there.  I know they weren't limiting themselves to the DNA of lower species.
13166/0:You're getting on my nerves.
13167/0:Back to business as usual.
13168/0:Okay.  The security door for the stairwell to the VIP lounge is on the ground floor.  The code is 11413.  Obey the rules and have a good time.
13169/0:I want to hear what you know about the terrorist attack that led to your escape from Tarsus Academy.
13170/0:Well, you've replaced everything else...
13171/0:I can't believe that madman, Saman, has transformed the Rauchstadt church into a barracks.
13172/0:The hazardous materials have since been contained and eliminated.  The Inclinator is now running on schedule.
13173/0:I must show this thing who's boss.
13174/0:Gotta show this thing who's boss.
13175/0:You sure you don't want to be alone with the sculptor?
13176/0:
13177/0:Gotta show this thing who's boss.
13178/0:Gotta show this thing who's boss.
13179/0:Gotta show this thing who's boss.
13180/0:Gotta show this thing who's boss.
13181/0:Gotta show this thing who's boss.
13182/0:Gotta show this thing who's boss.
13183/0:Of course she is.  That was my precise purpose in sending you to save her -- so that you would believe me when I say that we face a great danger.  The Illuminati have been very successful at re-shaping the post-Collapse world.  Control of our technology would allow them to create a handpicked ruling elite.
13184/0:(grunt) Oh God, I'm hit!
13185/0:(grunt) Oh God, I'm hit!
13186/0:Yeah.  How about cutting me in for some of that reward money.
13187/0:I'll get by, I guess.
13188/0:It's a lot of money.  We'll attract my husband's attention if I don't handle this properly.  He is pretty clueless, but has started asking questions about certain expenses....
13189/0:
13190/0:Leave me alone.
13191/0:There was a strike.  The workers demanded improved security, but it quickly turned into a riot.
13192/0:So you're modified?
13193/0:For your information, testing has yet to prove the counter-agent's safety.  I'm not going to be responsible for creating yet another cloud of self-replicating dust motes.
13194/0:We can have jobs and sustainability at the same time.  We tried to make this point in our peaceful protests, according to Luminon Saman's orders.
13195/0:What do you think he'll do?
13196/0:I haven't seen you before. Welcome to our small medina.
13197/0:Just tell me who to bring down.
13198/0:The black market biomod sounds great, but I haven't got the credits. [500]
13199/0:(grunt) Oh God, I'm hit!
13200/0:That was nobody.  Dr. Nassif -- a marine biologist dropping off some samples.  The person we're worried about is after the Mag Rail.
13201/0:(grunt) Oh God, I'm hit!
13202/0:(grunt) Oh God, I'm hit!
13203/0:(grunt) Oh God, I'm hit!
13204/0:If it was me, I'd go around.  Crawl through an air vent or something.
13205/0:(grunt) Oh God, I'm hit!
13206/0:(grunt) Oh God, I'm hit!
13207/0:I bet it IS a drill.  Some kind of test...
13208/0:(grunt) Oh God, I'm hit!
13209/0:(grunt) Oh God, I'm hit!
13210/0:(grunt) Oh God, I'm hit!
13211/0:(grunt) Oh God, I'm hit!
13212/0:I don't know what sort of funny business you have in mind, but if that woman dies so do you.  Now get your butt to the SSC station.  Move!
13213/0:That's what the Grand Master says.  As if these creatures' little engineered minds weren't warped enough to begin with.  Maybe they had something to do with those scientists' final ends.
13214/0:No thanks.
13215/0:
13216/0:Fine by me.  I got my own situation in Trier, anyway.
13217/0:Sophia Sak.  Crime boss of the port.  Holds court in the Heron's Loft building on the other side of town past the Order church.  Took my jet 'cause she said I came up short on a shipment, but she's a lying thief.  Everyone knows Sid's never lost a load.
13218/0:(grunt) That got my attention.
13219/0:Captain Zettel, you must be occupied with the disturbance.  Luminon Saman says to call off the search for Billie Adams.  He says she survived the electrical discharge.  Perhaps she left the facility when you weren't looking...?  Carry on.  May Purity prevail.
13220/0:(grunt) That got my attention.
13221/0:(grunt) That got my attention.
13222/0:(grunt) That got my attention.
13223/0:I want the ammo clip. [200]
13224/0:(grunt) That got my attention.
13225/0:(grunt) That got my attention.
13226/0:(grunt) That got my attention.
13227/0:I'm sure it means the apocalypse is coming, just like my aunt always warned.
13228/0:(grunt) That got my attention.
13229/0:(grunt) That got my attention.
13230/0:I'll take the silencer. [600]
13231/0:(grunt) That got my attention.
13232/0:Right, then.  Meet me at the pad?
13233/0:What's really monstrous is the way these children are being hopelessly polluted.  We can't allow humanity to damage itself like this.
13234/0:Now you've got groups like The Order who are making more trouble every day BECAUSE of the WTO, especially their more extreme members.
13235/0:I can't believe there isn't a QueeQueg's up here.
13236/0:That doesn't sound quite right. 
13236/1:I wonder what that sound was.
13237/0:Your enemies know who you are.  You can't hide for long.
13238/0:That doesn't sound quite right. 
13238/1:I wonder what that sound was.
13239/0:I hope Mathers is okay.  We need his help to activate the repair bot, but if he comes through that cloud, it might kill him.
13240/0:Long shift.  Am I starting to hallucinate?  
13240/1:I could've sworn I just saw something there.
13241/0:Time's running out.
13242/0:Long shift.  Am I starting to hallucinate?  
13242/1:I could've sworn I just saw something there.
13243/0:Long shift.  Am I starting to hallucinate?  
13243/1:I could've sworn I just saw something there.
13244/0:Was that you?  
13245/0:There's nothing back here for civilians, just a bunch of maintenance and custodial stuff.
13246/0:Was that you?  
13247/0:He will contact you himself.  I was instructed to say nothing more.
13248/0:Was that you?  
13249/0:Again? 
13249/1:I'm really beginning to wonder what's going on here.
13250/0:We explained that our research would eventually permit us to offer the same opportunities for biomodification to everyone.  She had a responsibility to the world to help advance this venerable cause.  Plus she was generously compensated for the necessary risks and sacrifices. 
13251/0:Again? 
13251/1:I'm really beginning to wonder what's going on here.
13252/0:You'd better introduce yourself to the others.  Klara's just down the hall, and Leo's running laps around the track.
13253/0:You're going to criticize the leader of the WTO -- in print?
13254/0:(grunt) That got my attention.
13255/0:(grunt) That got my attention.
13256/0:(groan) I don't think I'll last much longer.
13257/0:(groan) I don't think I'll last much longer.
13258/0:
13259/0:(groan) I don't think I'll last much longer.
13260/0:
13261/0:(groan) I don't think I'll last much longer.
13262/0:(groan) I don't think I'll last much longer.
13263/0:(groan) I don't think I'll last much longer.
13264/0:I guess I don't have to ask whether you're still working for the Omar.
13265/0:The Seattle Tarsus Intermediate facility was raided, with numerous casualties.  The extent of the damage is not yet known.
13266/0:
13267/0:(groan) I don't think I'll last much longer.
13268/0:No charge.  I'm waiting to pick up a passenger.  Until I locate him, however, I'm authorized to take other jobs..
13269/0:(groan) I don't think I'll last much longer.
13270/0:You look fine to ME.
13271/0:Can I help you?
13272/0:Looks like the Templars are still causing trouble.
13273/0:The black market biomod sounds like a deal.  I'll take it. [500]
13274/0:Again? 
13274/1:I'm really beginning to wonder what's going on here.
13275/0:It's not too late to avoid another Collapse.  Transmit the Aquinas specification to the WTO orbiting science platform, Ophelia.  Most of humanity wants to rebuild, Alex.  Ignore them, and what are you fighting for?  Not freedom.  Not democracy.  Then WHAT?
13276/0:Who's there?
13276/1:Hello? //more insistently
13276/2:Checking this out.
13276/3:Is someone there?
13276/4:I'm not playing.
13276/5:This is a workplace, gentlemen.
13276/6:I'm having a look.
13277/0:Who's there?
13277/1:Hello? //more insistently
13277/2:Hang on.
13277/3:That's enough.
13277/4:I know someone's there.
13277/5:You're there, aren't you?
13277/6:Is that you?
13278/0:Who's there?
13278/1:Hello? //more insistently
13278/2:Enough is enough.
13278/3:I'm not playing.
13278/4:I'm warning you.
13278/5:I'm at the end of my tether.
13278/6:Who's there?
13278/7:That's enough.
13279/0:As you wish.
13280/0:Fie, enough of these drills...
13280/1:Who's there?
13280/2:I'm paying attention now.
13280/3:This isn't funny.
13280/4:I'm ready.
13280/5:Time to get to the bottom of this.
13281/0:Too many drills.
13281/1:Who's there?
13281/2:That's enough.
13281/3:Show yourself.
13281/4:I'm not playing.
13281/5:I'll find out what's going on....
13281/6:Who's there?  (mutters)  Why's it always MY watch...?
13281/7:I know you're here.
13281/8:Come on out... you know the drill.
13281/9:Someone there?  You better not let me find you...
13282/0:Fie, enough of these drills...
13282/1:Who's there?
13282/2:Could be a bogey.
13282/3:Could be a drill.
13282/4:Hear me if you're there -- leave now before it's too late.
13283/0:Until we can get a lift, we're stuck here, under siege.
13284/0:What do you think this is now?
13284/1:Haven't they trifled with us enough?
13284/2:Someone's making a mistake.
13284/3:I'll not be toyed with.
13284/4:Eyes peeled-- picture of a professional.
13285/0:What do you think this is now?
13285/1:Haven't we had enough drills already?
13286/0:
13286/1:
13287/0:What do you think this is now?
13287/1:Haven't they trifled with us enough?
13287/2:Who'd be crazy enough to test us?
13288/0:Anywhere else you want to go, I'll be right here.  [500 credits.]
13289/0:In time, we will open their eyes.
13290/0:The WTO wishes no harm to come to Her Holiness. This summit was to be an opportunity to soothe the tensions between our organizations and to root out the extremists causing trouble in Trier.
13291/0:(groan) I don't think I'll last much longer.
13292/0:Here.
13293/0:(groan) I don't think I'll last much longer.
13294/0:(groan) I don't think I'll last much longer.
13295/0:(groan) I don't think I'll last much longer.
13296/0:He nearly died two years ago.  My chief scientist, Tracer Tong, thought that he had perfected the biomod substrate, but there were recombinant anomalies in Paul.  He had to be cryogenically frozen to save his life.  Luckily, you and the other subjects at last accepted complete transformation.
13297/0:I eavesdropped on the Templar recruiting station in the arcology.
13298/0:Stop wasting time -- they're coming this way.
13299/0:It burns!
13300/0:I never wanted to send any of our children away for school, but without education a child is helpless.
13301/0:You should have acted quickly!
13302/0:It burns!
13303/0:Give me a rain check?
13304/0:It burns!
13305/0:It burns!
13306/0:We're getting reports that Her Holiness is considering the offer, but this is what she had to say to reporters a moment ago:
13307/0:It burns!
13308/0:It burns!
13309/0:Oh, sure.  It's some kind of prep school.  But that doesn't mean those girls don't know how to party.  I hear they sneak off to a secret room through a vent.  But don't tell the Headmaster...
13310/0:I just cruised by Flight Bay 23, but the pilot beacon's dead.  You'll need to bring it online before I can land.
13311/0:dsadasd
13312/0:Yeah, good for me and good for you, too -- if you were smart and put your money on the Snake.
13313/0:One thing I can't stand is one human being who hates another human being.  Know what I mean?
13314/0:We'll try to overlook your betrayal at the Mako facility if you help us find Dr. Nassif.  She comes from a poor family in the plague-stricken village outside the arcology walls.  You'll have to make your way to Level 108.  Billie is waiting for you in the mosque that separates the New Cairo arcology from the village.  She'll be coordinating the operation.
13315/0:No thanks.  I'll find another way to get in.
13316/0:I know you're there!
13316/1:Just go ahead and try something.  
13316/2:I'm ready for you...  
13316/3:Are we going to do this?
13316/4:I'm ready for you.
13317/0:You have permission to pass.
13318/0:I know you're there!
13318/1:Just go ahead and try something. 
13318/2:No more hiding!
13318/3:This has stopped being amusing.
13318/4:Come here.
13319/0:Sure, take out Dumier's commandos on the dock.  [250]
13320/0:You've made a mistake.
13320/1:I'm ready, stranger.
13320/2:This is what I was trained for.
13320/3:Where are you?
13320/4:No more hiding!
13321/0:Well, good luck out there.
13322/0:You can't sneak up on us.
13322/1:Stand ready.
13323/0:You can't sneak up on us.
13323/1:Stand ready.
13324/0:
13325/0:You can't sneak up on us.
13325/1:Stand ready.
13326/0:The sicker you get, the harder it is not to believe.  You want to believe you can think the pain away...
13327/0:I will keep this area secure.
13327/1:You must have no idea who you're messing with.
13328/0:I will keep this area secure.
13328/1:You must have no idea who you're messing with.
13328/2:You're dead -- you hear me?!
13328/3:Gimme a shot!  (mutters)  Damn mercenaries...
13328/4:I'm armed!  This better not be a joke.
13328/5:Whoever you are, you're making a big mistake.
13328/6:I see you, you're dead!
13329/0:I will keep this area secure.
13329/1:You must have no idea who you're messing with.
13329/2:Someone must have a deathwish.
13329/3:Come on out and die.
13329/4:Make it quick... where are you?
13329/5:Where are you?  Let me see your face.
13329/6:Identify yourself. You're in a lot of trouble.
13329/7:Don't play games with the Knights Templar.
13330/0:I'm certain it's nothing we can't handle.
13331/0:Besides the usual offerings, we've got the latest NG sim on the second floor.  The owner usually hangs out up there, where he can watch everything.  If you need more privacy than the ground floor can offer, you might ask him about the VIP Club.  The stairs are on the right, just after you enter.
13332/0:I told you -- those weapon mods are stolen.  They don't belong in a display case on the side of the road.
13333/0:Clearly, anyone capable of planning such an operation --
13334/0:It burns!
13335/0:We share your condemnation of the WTO, but we prefer less violent solutions, whenever possible.
13336/0:It burns!
13337/0:It burns!
13338/0:It burns!
13339/0:Hello.
13340/0:It burns!
13341/0:It burns!
13342/0:(moan) Was that... poison?!
13343/0:
13344/0:(moan) Was that... poison?!
13345/0:I have to admit, there has been some talk here of replacing SSC security guards with WTO military.  I expect there will be some fallout.  Just wanted to let you know that we have the situation in hand.
13346/0:(moan) Was that... poison?!
13347/0:(moan) Was that... poison?!
13348/0:It's not like they have a warm and fuzzy image to uphold.  What are they hiding?
13349/0:
13349/1:
13349/2:
13349/3:
13349/4:
13350/0:For your information, testing has yet to prove the counter-agent's safety.  I'm not going to be responsible for creating yet another cloud of self-replicating dust motes.
13351/0:I'm certain it's nothing we can't handle.
13352/0:That beam was clean.  Whoo!  Like a laser.  Hard to believe it's actually a matter-stream.
13353/0:I'm certain it's nothing we can't handle.
13354/0:By the skull of Sidon!
13354/1:Holy --!
13355/0:(laugh) I think you better get out of here before one of these fanatics puts a red hood on your head.
13356/0:By the skull of Sidon!
13356/1:Holy --!
13357/0:With the commission we're getting, you guys can use them for lawn ornaments for all I care.
13358/0:By the skull of Sidon!
13358/1:Holy --!
13359/0:Panzerwerks finally reached their breaking point.
13360/0:Just my overactive imagination, it seems.
13360/1:Perhaps it was just another guard trying to spook me?  Heh heh.
13361/0:Just my overactive imagination, it seems.
13361/1:Perhaps it was just another guard trying to spook me?  Heh heh.
13362/0:Just my overactive imagination, it seems.
13362/1:Perhaps it was just another guard trying to spook me?  Heh heh.
13363/0:Let's talk about you.
13364/0:Bah, I must have been seeing things.
13364/1:Just an illusion, I guess.
13365/0:Bah, I must have been seeing things.
13365/1:Just an illusion, I guess.
13366/0:The WTO should crack down on these Templars.
13367/0:Her weapons have been silenced.
13368/0:I'll keep that in mind.
13369/0:I did what you asked.  It looks like Pequod's image is going to get a facelift.
13370/0:But if you really must see for yourself, I can't stop you, as long as you have your access pass.  You did remember to bring it, didn't you?  We can't have random visitors wandering through.
13371/0:Ah, Alex D.  Chief Morgan has had a lot to say about you.  
13372/0:I just hope I can make enough cash before another Pequod's opens.
13373/0:Sure, tell me about the guards.
13374/0:The coffee's destroyed.
13375/0:Great doing business with you.
13376/0:Politicians are a specialty of mine.  Do me a favor -- quit digging through my files.
13377/0:Bah, I must have been seeing things.
13377/1:Just an illusion, I guess.
13378/0:My friend must have slinked away.
13378/1:Well... it's all clear now.
13379/0:My friend must have slinked away.
13379/1:Well... it's all clear now.
13380/0:There hasn't been commercial air travel since the Collapse.  Twenty years ago.
13381/0:My friend must have slinked away.
13381/1:Well... it's all clear now.
13382/0:I'm not sure where I'm headed yet.  Sit tight.
13383/0:It sure sounded like someone was mucking about... Oh well.
13383/1:Whoever was making that noise seems to have slipped away.
13384/0:The Templars want to CLEAN UP this scabby planet.  I think they're going to do a good job, too.
13385/0:
13385/1:
13386/0:It sure sounded like someone was mucking about... Oh well.
13386/1:Whoever was making that noise seems to have slipped away.
13387/0:It sure sounded like someone was mucking about... Oh well.
13387/1:Whoever was making that noise seems to have slipped away.
13388/0:Gah!  I'll have no satisfaction for this wrong done to me.
13388/1:That troublemaker must've cleared out.
13389/0:Gah!  I'll have no satisfaction for this wrong done to me.
13389/1:That troublemaker must've cleared out.
13390/0:Gah!  I'll have no satisfaction for this wrong done to me.
13390/1:That troublemaker must've cleared out.
13391/0:So you're Mr. Kurczec.  I've heard of your partner, Mr. O'Rourke, in Seattle.
13392/0:Need a pass or what?
13393/0:One of your own captains?  AWOL?
13394/0:You've always been good at making friends.
13395/0:Did you tell the authorities?
13396/0:Sorry?  Who are you to be sorry?  You kill the parents, kill the plants -- yes, I see who comes and goes from the greenhouse -- and now you come to kill ME?  Well, the Nassif family is fighting back.  Leila escaped and you won't find her.
13397/0:Matter clip's always useful, but I can't afford it. [200]
13398/0:Please deposit credits.
13399/0:Deputized and immunized for a scabland sweep.  One hour, tops.
13400/0:I'm here to make sure you keep your mouth shut about Lt. Archer's project.
13401/0:It's not too late!  Just stop right now, and you won't bring that monster back into the world.
13402/0:Well...  Just take care of yourselves until the arcology is safe for classes again.
13403/0:Dr. Nassif will contact YOU.  Now leave at once.  You are too valuable to us to be risking your life in foolish expeditions.
13404/0:I've already heard rumors about this spill.
13405/0:That's a lotta hours you're lookin' at down there, a lotta hours tryin' to beat some sense into that prehistoric brain.
13406/0:The zone seems to be clear now.
13406/1:My little visitor seems to have moved along.  No matter...
13407/0:Auxiliary systems not responding.  Greenhouse shutting down.
13408/0:The zone seems to be clear now.
13408/1:My little visitor seems to have moved along.  No matter...
13409/0:The zone seems to be clear now.
13409/1:My little visitor seems to have moved along.  No matter...
13410/0:That violent thug wised up and left.
13410/1:It seems this zone is safe and secure again.
13411/0:
13412/0:That violent thug wised up and left.
13412/1:It seems this zone is safe and secure again.
13413/0:Sand everywhere.  Ick.  And this haze!
13414/0:That violent thug wised up and left.
13414/1:It seems this zone is safe and secure again.
13415/0:Transaction complete.
13416/0:An end to that thief's treachery.
13416/1:This zone looks safe from sticky fingers for now.
13417/0:An end to that thief's treachery.
13417/1:This zone looks safe from sticky fingers for now.
13418/0:An end to that thief's treachery.
13418/1:This zone looks safe from sticky fingers for now.
13419/0: In any event, we've located the facility, positioned the powered armor troopers and begun excavation.
13420/0:That's the first wise decision that killer has made -- choosing to flee.
13420/1:A murderer AND a coward.  How vile.  At least there will be no more trouble.
13421/0:Just let me know when you're ready.
13422/0:What are your scientists going to do with Paul Denton?
13423/0:Yes.  JC wants you to meet him at Liberty Island.  It won't be easy leaving New Cairo, though.  The Templars have seized the arcology.
13424/0:Now that the Inclinator's running again, I can get back to work.
13425/0:New Cairo was one of the first WTO enclaves -- an inspiration for other cities wanting to incorporate.  I love singing here because people actually have the time to kick back and enjoy a concert, though lately -- I don't know -- the city seems different.
13426/0:Pleasure doing business with you.
13427/0:And...?
13428/0:Nobody ever listens to me, but I think the WTO and Order should team up.  You know, one side handles business, the other side self-help.
13429/0:Reminds me of the early days after the Collapse, when some governments used nukes to put down plagues and nanite swells.
13430/0:Just taking a look around.
13431/0:You must be the captain who goes down with the ship.
13432/0:Dr. Nassif said to carry on like normal and wait for an extraction.
13433/0:Business is business.
13434/0:You're not getting away from us again.
13435/0:Prepare to meet your fate!
13436/0:Prepare to meet your fate!
13437/0:You have the Aquinas Protocol, and here I am.  Your enemies are defeated.
13438/0:That's the first wise decision that killer has made -- choosing to flee.
13438/1:A murderer AND a coward.  But at least the trouble's over now.
13439/0:Remember the Templar message.  The more you look at the world, the more truthful my words will seem.
13440/0:That's the first wise decision that killer has made -- choosing to flee.
13440/1:A murderer AND a coward.  But at least the trouble's over now.
13441/0:I think I just saw something... or someone...
13441/1: Enough of this hide and seek.
13442/0:I'll let you know.
13443/0:Thanks for your help.
13444/0:
13445/0:You're in my sights.
13445/1:This is too easy.
13446/0:I think I just saw something... or someone...
13446/1:Enough of this hide and seek.
13447/0:You're in my sights.
13447/1:This is too easy.
13448/0:I think I just saw something... or someone...
13448/1: Enough of this hide and seek.
13449/0:We may have some company here.
13449/1:Stand ready -- I think I just saw something.
13450/0:Have you SEEN that thing?  It was like the ice was building itself into something.  Maybe I'm starting to lose my mind...
13451/0:We may have some company here.
13451/1:Stand ready -- I think I just saw something.
13452/0:
13452/1:
13452/2:
13452/3:
13453/0:We may have some company here.
13453/1:Stand ready -- I think I just saw something.
13454/0:I'm not blind, you know.
13454/1:Aha!  I see you now!
13455/0:They have me in the hangar on the lower level.  Be prepared.  I am being guarded by a WTO security force.
13456/0:I'm not blind, you know.
13456/1:Aha!  I see you now!
13457/0:She has the same occipital implants as you do.  Interesting.
13458/0:Still with the Church?  I see you're wearing your vestments.
13459/0:I hate to relinquish the arcology to them, but it's time to regroup and devise new tactics for dealing with the Templars now that we've seen their true face.
13460/0:Sorry, I don't have enough money. [500]
13461/0:Does yours fit?
13462/0:We'll meet again in New York.  To send a message to the rest of the world, I plan to restore the Statue of Liberty.
13463/0:Who made it?
13464/0:Thank you for your help.
13465/0:The Nassif Greenhouse is already producing food -- clean, affordable vegetables.
13466/0:Engage this objective.
13466/1:Assigning new target.
13467/0:Engage this objective.
13467/1:Assigning new target.
13468/0:I'm not blind, you know.
13468/1:Aha!  I see you now!
13469/0:This one looks like a job for a bot.
13469/1:I'm summoning a bot.
13470/0:We have company.
13470/1:That fool, trying to sneak up on us.
13471/0:This one looks like a job for a bot.
13471/1:I'm summoning a bot.
13472/0:We have company.
13472/1:That fool, trying to sneak up on us.
13473/0:Where are those med bots when you really need them?
13474/0:We have company.
13474/1:That fool, trying to sneak up on us.
13475/0:Where are those med bots when you really need them?
13476/0:That's a strange sound...
13476/1:What's that I hear?
13477/0:Special kill bonuses for SSC have been approved for this target.
13478/0:A repair bot should be able to fix that quickly. 
13479/0:That's a strange sound...
13479/1:What's that I hear?
13480/0:I'll check back when I have the money to make a reasonable offer.  [500 credits.]
13481/0:That's a strange sound...
13481/1: What's that I hear?
13482/0:I just heard something -- someone may be sneaking around.
13482/1:That was a strange noise -- stand ready.
13483/0:No more congestion, no more fatigue.  Use VitaTech Cure-11.
13484/0:
13485/0:I just heard something -- someone may be sneaking around.
13485/1:That was a strange noise -- stand ready.
13486/0:You have your orders.
13487/0:I just heard something -- someone may be sneaking around.
13487/1:That was a strange noise -- stand ready.
13488/0:We aren't some self-help outfit like the Order Church.
13489/0:Rise with us, Denton.
13490/0:The black market biomod sounds like a deal.  I'll take it. [1000]
13491/0:
13492/0:
13493/0:I killed her.
13494/0:Thank goodness you can count on Standard Security.
13495/0:Some of us are smart enough to see through you.
13496/0:Thanks for the help.  Mr. O'Rourke appreciates it.
13497/0:I had a run-in with the Templars in the apartment building across from the mosque.  They're history.  Maybe there won't be any raid.
13498/0:The service will be a theft.  In the basement of Club Vox in Upper Seattle the manager has hidden a cadaver.  An unusual mutant he wishes to sell to a biotech firm.  We are interested in the properties of the mutant's tissues, which are highly resistant to radiation and extreme temperature.
13499/0:A repair bot should be able to fix that quickly. 
13500/0:I'm calling for mech support.
13501/0:
13502/0:I'm calling for mech support.
13503/0:Time to regroup.  
13503/1:Withdraw!
13504/0:Time to regroup.  
13504/1:Withdraw!
13505/0:I think something just bumped into me.
13505/1:What was that I just felt?
13506/0:All that training and look at you -- shakin' from head to toe.
13507/0:Flank the target!
13508/0:I think something just bumped into me.
13508/1:What was that I just felt?
13509/0:
13510/0:Flank the target!
13511/0:I think something just bumped into me.
13511/1:What was that I just felt?
13512/0:Surround him!
13513/0:Oof!  I demand satisfaction for this affront.
13513/1:(grunt) I'll not stand for this.
13514/0:The service you performed for my business associate is appreciated.  Mr. O'Rourke was a danger to the sect.
13515/0:Surround him!
13516/0:Oof!  I demand satisfaction for this affront.
13516/1:(grunt) I'll not stand for this.
13517/0:I think I could use someone like you in the novel I'm writing, a polished gem of a woman broken loose from her fitting in society, half jewel, half stone.
13518/0:Surround her!
13519/0:Oof!  I demand satisfaction for this affront.
13519/1:(grunt) I'll not stand for this.
13520/0:By the skull of Sidon!
13520/1:By the Grail!
13521/0:By the skull of Sidon!
13521/1:By the Grail!
13522/0:By the skull of Sidon!
13522/1:By the Grail!
13523/0:I'll find the person responsible for this violent attack!
13523/1:There's been a scuffle.
13524/0:You're pretty sharp.  I should warn you that the manager of Club Vox hired me to kill you.
13525/0:My first gig -- and I blew it.  Oh God did I blow it!
13526/0:Huh?
13526/1:Hello?
13526/2:Maybe something's up.
13527/0:
13527/1:
13527/2:
13527/3:
13527/4:
13527/5:
13528/0:Surround her!
13529/0:Hey, yo, we don't need no feebs jumping in the ring.
13530/0:Slowly but surely... C'mon.
13530/1:Careful... Move in...
13531/0:Purity is the only way to save humanity from ruin.  I had hoped you'd eventually see this.  The Templars are not murderers.  We passionately want what's best for humankind and realize these dire circumstances demand certain sacrifices.  
13532/0:Slowly but surely... C'mon.
13532/1:Careful... Move in...
13533/0:Move in -- NOW!
13533/1:Show 'em what we've got -- GO!
13534/0:Move in -- NOW!
13534/1:Show 'em what we've got -- GO!
13535/0:I'll find the person responsible for this violent attack!
13535/1:There's been a scuffle.
13536/0:Vile desecration... //hissed
13536/1:You shall contaminate humanity no more!
13537/0:I'll find the person responsible for this violent attack!
13537/1:There's been a scuffle.
13538/0:Vile desecration... //hissed
13538/1:You shall contaminate humanity no more!
13539/0:What's this?  Knocked out?
13539/1:... been drummed senseless...
13540/0:I'll check back when I need a pilot.
13541/0:We're sick of you arcology types coming out here, pointing and laughing, like this is a theme park or a zoo.
13542/0:Villain!
13542/1:Kneel before Baphomet!
13542/2:Any last requests before I finish you off?
13543/0:What's this?  Knocked out?
13543/1:... been drummed senseless...
13544/0:Villain!
13544/1:Kneel before Baphomet!
13544/2:Any last requests before I finish you off?
13545/0:What's this?  Knocked out?
13545/1:... been drummed senseless...
13546/0:Looks like you came across a maintenance building.  Maybe you can learn something from one of the civilian employees inside.
13547/0:May you rest in peace.
13547/1:Another casualty...
13548/0:This is too simple!
13548/1:What were you thinking, taking on a Templar?
13549/0:
13550/0:May you rest in peace.
13550/1:Another casualty...
13551/0:May you rest in peace.
13551/1:Another casualty...
13552/0:Brilliant researchers... without an ounce of common sense.
13553/0:
13554/0:We're so fortunate that Luminon Saman had the vision to lead us away from ruin.
13555/0:You need an economic base to run a war.
13556/0:Looks like you checked out at HQ.  You're free to pass.
13557/0:That was a joke.  I already have his jet -- I don't have any use for a half pound of his flesh.  Did you have some business to discuss?  I need a pilot, but until Sid settles his debt I can't let him handle product for the Omar.
13558/0:I didn't know SSC had plainclothes working the museum...  I guess, if you can call that "plainclothes."
13559/0:Her Holiness will be pleased -- and you will be rewarded.  Praise Order, praise your loyalty.  Now slip away.  Your pilot will be waiting on the roof.
13560/0:You are taking food right out of the mouths of children!
13561/0:The latest in our ongoing coverage of the missing persons reports at the Tarsus Academy in New Cairo.  The Headmaster, Silas Archer, has turned up dead.   
13562/0:Where's SSC?  They're supposed to handle this sort of thing.
13563/0:We've had three nightclubs on that spot in less than a year.  Fronts!  All of them!
13564/0:
13565/0:
13566/0:
13567/0:This is too simple!
13567/1:What were you thinking, taking on a Templar?
13568/0:(cough cough)  It's okay, Mom.  I'll get better.
13569/0:Soon there'll be one less impurity to worry about...
13569/1:At last, an end to this desecration...
13570/0:What's the problem?  You scared?
13571/0:Resident unavailable.
13572/0:Soon there'll be one less impurity to worry about...
13572/1:At last, an end to this desecration...
13573/0:We've almost got her.
13574/0:... go... damage... you are the solution...
13575/0:Right before getting me into this mess, the record company fired my manager.  Pretty stupid, huh?
13576/0:We've almost got her.
13577/0:Sure, make a run at the Statue.  [1000]
13578/0:We've almost got him.
13579/0:We've almost got him.
13580/0:Not much fight left in her now.
13581/0:Someone's got to fix the nanoformer or release that repair bot.
13582/0:Not much fight left in her now.
13583/0:That beam was clean.  Whoo!  Like a laser.  Hard to believe it's actually a matter-stream.
13584/0:Not much fight left in him now.
13585/0:I will keep my word.
13586/0:I knocked that greasel out cold.  You sure you saw Gob-zilla?
13587/0:Our intel was out of date and we were just outnumbered.  The SSC never trained for large-scale operations.  I guess this is our wake-up call.
13588/0:Have the local police clean up the mess.  You'll be fine.
13589/0:Turn your attention away from creation toward that which is uncreated. Ignore the humanmade hierarchies and material miseries.  As you achieve this state of consciousness you will achieve samadhi and be ecstatically transported outside the bounds and limits imposed upon your spirit by today's society's terrible disorder.
13590/0:Primary objective:  Guard premises.  Special target:  Alex D.
13591/0:One puppeted by the Illuminati.
13592/0:So much outside The Plan.  It must be set right.
13593/0:Your GEAR?  You're leaving?  Sid, you made me get this big place. Do you know how high my rent is?
13594/0:If you want to know more, you've got to do the real snooping yourself.
13595/0:If you're asking about the Inclinator, I DON'T KNOW.  Some sort of toxic spill.  We're on it.
13596/0:Still, one less Omar is definitely a victory as far as I'm concerned.
13597/0:Our orders are to work together.  We will destroy Paul Denton and return biomod technology to international regulation.
13598/0:Exactly.
13599/0:Not much fight left in him now.
13600/0:Vile and unnatural creature!
13600/1:I HATE these things.
13600/2:I do not fear battling such an abomination.
13600/3:Gah!  This genetic disgrace must be exterminated!
13601/0:What do YOU want?
13602/0:Vile and unnatural creature!
13602/1:I HATE these things.
13602/2:I do not fear battling such an abomination.
13602/3:Gah!  This genetic disgrace must be exterminated!
13603/0:Only the Omar can provide the technology you will need in order to survive.
13604/0:This beast will soon be destroyed.  
13605/0:This beast will soon be destroyed.  
13606/0:The interface with Ophelia, a new star in the sky.  The Eye that was prophesied.
13607/0:You will have to try harder than that.
13607/1:See? You are no match for a Templar.
13608/0:Wish I had the buy-in money, but I don't.  [100]
13609/0:You will have to try harder than that.
13609/1:See? You are no match for a Templar.
13610/0:Yes, and thank you.  He arrived safely and was imprisoned for only a short time before you rescued him, so the Templars did not have enough time to cause any permanent damage to us.
13611/0:(groan) It'll take more than that to stop a Templar.
13611/1:(groan)
13612/0:We are people just like you.
13613/0:(groan) It'll take more than that to stop a Templar.
13613/1:(groan)
13614/0:Nooo!  It burns.
13614/1:(shriek)
13615/0:I make sure no one tries to sneak in.
13616/0:
13616/1:
13617/0:Her Holiness and Chairman Dumier are making a business deal.  It may bring money, it may bring power, but it won't bring balance into the lives of ordinary people.
13618/0:What am I going to do!?
13619/0:Well done.  Our enemies will become known to us.  Return to the medina for your compensation.
13620/0:
13621/0:I just got an update from Chief Morgan -- what were you thinking?  Are you letting the Order turn you into a fanatical assassin?  You could've helped the WTO and they could've helped you.  But now my orders are to neutralize you, just like any other extremist operative.
13622/0:Go ahead.  Send the code.
13623/0:Your science is too cruel.
13624/0:Well it's now clear that the net has gone black... and we're trapped here.  There's only so much food and energy, but we should be able to come up with some way to get back home.
13625/0:I supplied him with weapons when he was a so-called freedom-fighter against MJ-12 in France.  Then he came to power and began persecuting independent scientists and businesses.
13626/0:I sure hope they get her out of there.
13627/0:Still with the Church?  I see you're wearing your vestments.
13628/0:Nooo!  It burns.
13628/1:(shriek)
13629/0:Ungh!  Poison!
13629/1:I've been hit with toxin...
13630/0:The idiot didn't follow through, though.  Tina just pumped Gob-zilla's hide full of zyme, and now there's my poor Snake-eyes up against Gob-zilla squared.  Poor guy doesn't stand a chance.  What I woulda paid to have the job done right.
13631/0:Ungh!  Poison!
13631/1:I've been hit with toxin...
13632/0:Which they will appropriate for themselves, whoever finds it first.
13633/0:Someone in the arcology started that rumor so that we'd blame ourselves.
13634/0:Gaaah!  My eyes!
13634/1:I'm... BLINDED!
13635/0:Gaaah!  My eyes!
13635/1:I'm... BLINDED!
13636/0:(groan)  I can't give up.
13636/1:(groan)
13637/0:
13638/0:(groan)  I can't give up.
13638/1:(groan)
13639/0:I will fight to the death for the Templar cause. //weakly, choked
13639/1:(groan)
13640/0:I will fight to the death for the Templar cause. //weakly, choked
13640/1:(groan)
13641/0:What's to tell?  It's where I live, fifteen years now.... I was the first one to show up.  Guess it was abandoned during the Collapse... I don't know what's goin' on out there, but this is my home, and I'm equipped for a fight if it comes to that.
13642/0:To purity...
13642/1:Damnation awaits you!
13643/0:Thanks for the warm welcome.
13644/0:I'll keep my word.  A nice bounty for Mr. VIP cyborg.
13645/0:Coy boy... What's the matter?  Don't like talking politics?
13646/0:No one saw a thing.  I think the kidnapping was an inside job.
13647/0:It's me again.
13648/0:For God's sake, leave me alone.  Yes, I have closed the greenhouse.  There was a murder there -- the murder of my brother.  The greenhouse will stay closed until I am certain that the Nassif family is safe.
13649/0:To purity...
13649/1:Damnation awaits you!
13650/0:(grunt)
13650/1:(grunt)
13651/0:(grunt)
13651/1:(grunt)
13652/0:Oomph!
13652/1:Wha --! ugh.
13653/0:Ah, youth... so refreshingly idealistic.
13654/0:Oomph!
13654/1:Wha --! ugh.
13655/0:And you don't care where I'm headed.  You're ready to go anywhere I decide to go.
13656/0:Leeches.  They want a monopoly on everything -- including security agents.
13657/0:She means that the Order doesn't pull down many enclave feebs.  Plenty of kooks up there, but they're afraid of the old neighborhoods.
13658/0:(gasp)
13659/0:Cindy.  Nah, she went all screwy in the head.
13660/0:(gasp)
13661/0:The leaders have all fallen.  Now destroy JC Dentons's machine and we are free.
13662/0:You--!
13663/0:Just one more hit like that...
13663/1:(laughs)  Easy target.
13663/2:Just like back home.
13663/3:Now that's a clean shot.
13663/4:There it is!
13664/0:Now what about Mr. P?
13665/0:Just one more hit like that...
13665/1:(laughs)  Easy target.
13666/0:He's an easy target.
13667/0:The intellectual property has been secured and will be analyzed by our experts.  Well done.  We will have another mission for you as soon as you learn where Dr. Nassif went.  Look for clues in the biolab on the second floor.  We believe that ApostleCorp has sleeper agents in that division of Mako.
13668/0:Her office is across from mine, on the other side of the reception area.  You the woman with covert ops training?  You want to make my day?  Bring me the balance sheet for that dive nightclub.  VOX.  Down at the end of the block.
13669/0:Do whatever you want.  It's not my problem.
13670/0:Yeah, I could use your help.  Follow me.
13671/0:I.... believe he understands.
13672/0:The WTO and Order are actually two branches of the same organization?
13673/0:Finish him off!  None of us will be safe until he's dead.
13674/0:
13675/0:He's an easy target.
13676/0:She's an easy target.
13677/0:She's an easy target.
13678/0:Advance?
13679/0:I got a hit.
13679/1:Not that hard to connect, really.
13680/0:I got a hit.
13680/1:Not that hard to connect, really.
13681/0:Guess there's not much we can do yet.
13682/0:Good luck.
13683/0:The quest for Purity prevails.
13683/1:I've put an end to that.
13684/0:The quest for Purity prevails.
13684/1:I've put an end to that.
13684/2:Guess that's a wrap.
13684/3:Not bad for my first assignment.
13685/0:Purity prevails.
13685/1:This horror has been put to rest.
13685/2:Poor thing, at least it's out of it's misery now.  (laughs) 
13686/0:Purity prevails.
13686/1:This horror has been put to rest.
13686/2:Poor thing, at least it's out of it's misery now.  (laughs) 
13686/3:(laugh) Those mods sure did YOU a lot of good...
13686/4:One less freak to worry about.
13687/0:Bah!  I missed!
13687/1: I can't connect!  
13688/0:We must protect the Illuminati plan at any cost.
13689/0:They don't pay me for customer relations.
13690/0:Soon everyone will share the nanites coursing through your veins.
13691/0:Good.  I don't want to have to rescue your jet again.
13692/0:I haven't got the credits for the biomods. [850]
13693/0:Alex, the grays are no threat to you -- they are allied with JC.  He approached you in peace, in order to warn you of the situation there.  Nothing can be done now.  Just focus on gaining access to JC's sanctuary and reviving him.
13694/0:I mean, you down with bein' a Knight?  A Knight Templar?
13695/0:There it is again.
13695/1:I wonder what that's about.
13696/0:Keep your hands to yourself.
13696/1:Stay away from me.
13696/2:I won't stand for this disrespect.
13697/0:
13698/0:There it is again.
13698/1:I wonder what that's about.
13699/0:That's not funny.  That's dangerous.
13699/1:I don't appreciate this needling.
13699/2:Gah!  I will not be intimidated by this nonsense.
13700/0:You just ensured your own extinction.  Or do you know something I don't?
13701/0:I think something's going on here.
13701/1:That's a bit unusual.
13702/0:That's not funny.  That's dangerous.
13702/1:I don't appreciate this needling.
13702/2:Gah!  I will not be intimidated by this nonsense.
13703/0:I think something's going on here.
13703/1:That's a bit unusual.
13704/0:That's not funny.  That's dangerous.
13704/1:I don't appreciate this needling.
13704/2:Gah!  I will not be intimidated by this nonsense.
13705/0:I think something's going on here.
13705/1:That's a bit unusual.
13706/0:You're giving me the creeps.
13706/1:Stop looking at me!
13706/2:
13707/0:These bots are for JC's protection.  Help me restore them, and maybe we will be able to trust each other again.
13708/0:You're giving me the creeps.
13708/1:Stop looking at me!
13708/2:
13709/0:Bah!  I missed!
13709/1: I can't connect!  
13710/0:What about the money I gave NG's manager?
13711/0:I think something's going on here.
13711/1:That's a bit unusual.
13712/0:You're giving me the creeps.
13712/1:Stop looking at me!
13712/2:
13713/0:Bah!  I missed!
13713/1:I missed the little fiend. 
13714/0:Well, now I'm paying attention...
13714/1:That's definitely not right.
13715/0:I'm really going to call security if you don't cut it out.
13715/1:Go find someone else to bother...
13715/2:Stop acting so weird.
13716/0:Bah!  I missed!
13716/1:I missed the little fiend. 
13717/0:The Director must've found someone to clean up the mess.
13718/0:During a Code Red, we advise everyone to wear breathers and other protective apparatus.  We urge high risk groups, such as children and the elderly, to avoid leaving the arcology entirely during such a time.
13719/0:Well, now I'm paying attention...
13719/1:That's definitely not right.
13720/0:I'm really going to call security if you don't cut it out.
13720/1:Go find someone else to bother...
13720/2:Stop acting so weird.
13721/0:Well, now I'm paying attention...
13721/1:That's definitely not right.
13722/0:I'm really going to call security if you don't cut it out.
13722/1:Go find someone else to bother...
13722/2:Stop acting so weird.
13723/0:(grunt)
13723/1:(grunt)
13724/0:Well, now I'm paying attention...
13724/1:That's definitely not right.
13725/0:(grunt)
13725/1:(grunt)
13726/0:They say that their war against augmented and genetically engineered humans is a war against infidels.
13727/0:Coward!  Come out where I can see you!
13727/1:I've lost the target.
13727/2:Won't be long now.
13727/3:Nobody's gonna help you!
13727/4:Where are you?  Over here, maybe?
13727/5:Almost bought the farm back there.
13728/0:Looks like Tina had to use the Claw instead of Gob-zilla.  Guess I owe you.
13729/0:Coward!  Come out where I can see you!
13729/1:I've lost the target.
13730/0:I'll find that disgrace, and I'll finish this.
13730/1:Can't expect honorable tactics from non-Templars, I guess.
13731/0:Get out!
13732/0:I'll find that disgrace, and I'll finish this.
13732/1:Can't expect honorable tactics from non-Templars, I guess.
13733/0:Funny way to end up a free agent.
13734/0:By the skull of Sidon, where did he go?
13735/0:I took this job because it was supposed to be safe and predictable.  Maybe I was better off working for SSC.
13736/0:
13737/0:All set.  Hop in and let's get out of here.
13738/0:Right.  Listen, I know where High Augur Chen wants to send you.  You have my permission to investigate Mako, but there will be no assassination.  Understand?  I expect you to follow my orders when you reach the facility.
13739/0:Pick your move, Bug.  That's it...
13740/0:I'll keep all of that in mind.
13741/0:Great, get us thrown out.  That's what I get for cuttin' in one of my low-life friends.
13742/0:This area has been secured.
13743/0:
13744/0:Let's just say that if this investigation of ApostleCorp does indeed uncover technologies for the modification and commodification of human bodies, I don't entirely trust the current leadership to destroy them.
13745/0:Alex, you finally made it in.  After my rescue mission fell apart, I didn't know how long we'd be here.
13746/0:No problem.  I guess I don't have to ask whether you're still working for the Omar.
13747/0:What's going on?!
13747/1:Gonna to put a stop to this.
13748/0:Don't hurt me!
13748/1:Not me!  No!
13748/2:I didn't DO anything!
13749/0:You may pass.
13750/0:What's going on?!
13750/1:Gonna to put a stop to this.
13751/0:Don't hurt me!
13751/1:Not me!  No!
13751/2:I didn't DO anything!
13752/0:What's going on?!
13752/1:Gonna to put a stop to this.
13753/0:Don't hurt me!
13753/1:Not me!  No!
13753/2:I didn't DO anything!
13754/0:What's going on?!
13754/1:Gonna to put a stop to this.
13755/0:Move it.
13755/1:You're not authorized to be here.
13755/2:This area's off-limits.
13756/0:Move it.
13756/1:You're not authorized to be here.
13756/2:This area's off-limits.
13757/0:You will first gain entry to the main complex.  Mako Ballistics is a very inward-looking, distrustful enterprise, so expect automated surveillance and armed guards.
13758/0:Looks like the area's clean.  
13759/0:It's so good to see you again, darling.  Any news about that apartment?
13760/0:I'm going to take care of this.
13760/1:This has got to stop.
13761/0:Move it.
13761/1:You're not authorized to be here.
13761/2:This area's off-limits.
13762/0:I'm going to take care of this.
13762/1:This has got to stop.
13763/0:You're about to push me too far.
13763/1:I'm almost at the end of my rope.
13763/2:I really thought I'd made myself clear.
13764/0:I'm going to take care of this.
13764/1:This has got to stop.
13765/0:You're about to push me too far.
13765/1:I'm almost at the end of my rope.
13765/2:I really thought I'd made myself clear.
13766/0:It will be an end to hierarchy -- as soon as you and JC share your abilities with the world.
13767/0:I'm going to take care of this.
13767/1:This has got to stop.
13768/0:You're about to push me too far.
13768/1:I'm almost at the end of my rope.
13768/2:I really thought I'd made myself clear.
13769/0:Hey!
13769/1:Gah!
13770/0:That's it!
13770/1:I won't take any more of this!
13771/0:That bad?
13772/0:Hey!
13772/1:Gah!
13773/0:
13773/1:
13773/2:
13773/3:
13773/4:
13774/0:How did you survive the raid?
13775/0:That's my assignment, but these cyborgs can fight when they have to.  I just wish we had a better tip -- like, when the raid's gonna happen.  Then maybe I could get some sleep.
13776/0:
13776/1:
13777/0:In the bull's eye today -- Chairman Dumier of the WTO.  Welcome, Chairman, I admire what you've done for the world community.
13778/0:Does this have anything to do with that scientist?  The one that came through the biolab and took the chopper?
13779/0:You don't want to get mixed up with a bunch of cyborgs, anyway.
13780/0:I'm running.
13781/0:I think you quoted Merton, too.  Discoveries should be public knowledge!  They're essential for fueling science as a whole.
13782/0:I knew you would save us!
13783/0:Hey!
13783/1:Gah!
13784/0:That's it!
13784/1:I won't take any more of this!
13785/0:What's your rate?
13786/0:Hey!
13786/1:Gah!
13787/0:That's it!
13787/1:I won't take any more of this!
13788/0:I make sure no one causes any problems.
13789/0:Looks it's gone, whatever it was.
13789/1:Nothing to worry about now.
13790/0:So you're ready to behave civilly now...
13790/1:I hope we're done with your theatrics.
13790/2:Good to see you've finally come to your senses.
13791/0:So you're ready to behave civilly now...
13791/1:I hope we're done with your theatrics.
13791/2:Good to see you've finally come to your senses.
13792/0:Looks it's gone, whatever it was.
13792/1:Nothing to worry about now.
13793/0:So you're ready to behave civilly now...
13793/1:I hope we're done with your theatrics.
13793/2:Good to see you've finally come to your senses.
13794/0:Looks it's gone, whatever it was.
13794/1:Nothing to worry about now.
13795/0:Don't back down!  We've got the advnatage...
13796/0:Looks it's gone, whatever it was.
13796/1:Nothing to worry about now.
13797/0:Better not try that against US...
13798/0:Our faith spread like wildfire just after the Collapse, but now everywhere I go I see skepticism.
13799/0:Something must be after it.
13800/0:I was bluffing, Alex.  You didn't need to go to so much trouble.  What kind of person do you think I am?
13801/0:Something must be after it.
13802/0:I'm going for help.
13803/0:Something must be after it.
13804/0:I'm going for help.
13805/0:Something must be after it.
13806/0:Well, I'm just glad when one of my fans believes in something besides gossip and celebrities.  Wanna know what I think?  I think there's nothing wrong with being a rich kid from a WTO enclave and still having some spirituality.
13807/0:I am beginning to doubt that anything is as it seems here.
13808/0:Slick lady like you?  You could come up with the cash if you really wanted to.
13809/0:First the WTO and Order sitting down for peace talks, and now the Templars taking over Cairo.  What a week.
13810/0:Well --
13811/0:Here.  Take that biomod.
13812/0:Sure.
13813/0:Enough.  Go now.
13814/0:Now that the situation is under control, we're going to need to tighten regulations so this never happens again.
13815/0:The biomod's too pricey for me. [500]
13816/0:Actually, I feel a little guilty when I think about all the people still living in post-Collapse shanties.  My family's from Lower Seattle.
13817/0:Captain Zettel, you must be occupied with the disturbance.  Luminon Saman says to call off the search for Billie Adams.  He says she survived the electrical discharge.  Perhaps she left the facility when you weren't looking...?  Carry on.  May Purity prevail.
13818/0:Poor thing.
13819/0:I'm going for help.
13820/0:Poor thing.
13821/0:I can't take anymore!
13821/1:(yell)
13822/0:I can't take anymore!
13822/1:(yell)
13823/0:There used to be laws about this sort of thing, but ever since the Collapse people do what they want.
13824/0:Deep in your heart, you know you will eventually join the Search.
13825/0:Poor thing.
13826/0:I can't take anymore!
13826/1:(yell)
13827/0:Poor thing.
13828/0:Interesting...
13829/0:No thanks.  I've seen all I need to see.
13830/0:Hmmm...
13830/1:That's odd...
13831/0:Interesting...
13832/0:What else do you know about this spy?
13833/0:Hmmm...
13833/1:That's odd...
13834/0:Think I saw something...
13834/1:That didn't look right...
13835/0:Hmmm...
13835/1:That's odd...
13836/0:Think I saw something...
13836/1:That didn't look right...
13837/0:Hmmm...
13837/1:That's odd...
13838/0:Hey, I think I saw something.
13839/0:Is that what you plan to tell corporate headhunters?  "What the hell?"
13840/0:
13840/1:
13840/2:
13841/0:Gah!
13841/1:(shriek)
13841/2:(yell)
13842/0:Hey, I think I saw something.
13843/0:We welcome parents' visits, but it IS the middle of the school day right now.
13844/0:
13845/0:Gah!
13845/1:(shriek)
13845/2:(yell)
13846/0:We're not alone down here.
13847/0:You think there's a political agenda -- behind my biomods?
13848/0:That was almost too easy.  I wish hunting these Omar freaks was a bit more of a challenge.
13849/0:It's been a pretty quiet week.
13850/0:Uh... Hello, Stan.  Are you sure?
13851/0:There's no turning back after Phase II.  I'd be almost invincible with cyborg hardware plus the Tarsus biomods, but...  this stuff's not like a nanite infusion.  I'm still sore from the transskeletal supports I already have.
13852/0:Right.  Well, I'll take out whoever you want for 500 credits.
13853/0:Thanks -- I think I'll hide out upstairs.
13854/0:Are you sure this is such a good idea?
13855/0:Right on.  Code's 5543.  Just don't get yourself shot like the last guy.
13856/0:Close the place down and go home.  Whoever came after my niece and murdered our technicians is still looking for her.  I came back to my apartment for my Parental Pass so that I could check up on my daughter at the Tarsus school, but the headmaster assures me that she's safe.  Still debating whether to go anyway.  Don't return to work until you hear from me personally.
13857/0:I try to explain the ways of the Order to my family, but they just dismiss me.
13858/0:Please be advised that Plague 11 incidents are up among medina residents.  Leave the arcology at your own discretion.
13859/0:Just curious.  The Pequod's in my hometown was always packed.
13860/0:Gah!
13860/1:(shriek)
13860/2:(yell)
13861/0:Mmm?  What was that?
13861/1:Hm, noises...
13862/0:Mmm?  What was that?
13862/1:Hm, noises...
13863/0:We should get moving.
13864/0:Gah!
13864/1:(shriek)
13864/2:(yell)
13865/0:Huh?
13865/1:Hello?
13865/2:Maybe something's up.
13866/0:That sounded like a person.  Pretty sure.
13867/0:Oh my God -- a body!
13867/1:Not moving... uh-oh...
13868/0:That sounded like a person.  Pretty sure.
13869/0:Oh my God -- a body!
13869/1:Not moving... uh-oh...
13870/0:I think something's there.  // surprise
13871/0:Jamila thinks maybe Eeva and Jennifer were thrown out, but I don't believe it.
13872/0:Oh my God -- a body!
13872/1:Not moving... uh-oh...
13873/0:I think something's there.  // surprise
13874/0:Oh my God -- a body!
13874/1:Not moving... uh-oh...
13875/0:(grunt) Hey!  Hey!
13875/1:(grunt) You wanna say that to my face?
13876/0:Just a trick.
13877/0:(grunt) Hey!  Hey!
13877/1:(grunt) You wanna say that to my face?
13878/0:Just a trick.
13879/0:(grunt) What the -- What're we gonna do?
13879/1:(grunt) What's goin' on?
13880/0:Just a trick.
13881/0:(grunt) What the -- What're we gonna do?
13881/1:(grunt) What's goin' on?
13882/0:Don't be naive.  Search Nassif's apartment.  Then go to the Order headquarters in the old Hartford Turbine warehouse in Lower Seattle.  It will all become clear to you.
13883/0:Just a trick.
13884/0:A shame we won't be working together.  Maybe another day.
13885/0:Let's go.
13886/0:You know -- the zoning rules, licensing procedures, the constant monitoring of markets.  A five-fold price-hike is pretty unusual.
13887/0:I'm tired of waiting.  The time for patience has passed.  Now it is time for action.
13888/0:
13889/0:
13889/1:
13890/0:Thanks for the tip.
13891/0:And your people...?
13892/0:No complaints.
13893/0:Well, I've turned your heart just in time.  Now go to the Statue and step into JC Denton's machine so that the ducts will be primed with your nanite-capsid architecture.  My scientists will do the rest.
13894/0:You are welcome to purchase technologies from us.
13895/0:Is that what you plan to tell corporate headhunters?  "What the hell?"
13896/0:
13896/1:
13896/2:
13896/3:
13896/4:
13896/5:
13897/0:Jesus Christ!
13898/0:What do you know about the Tarsus Academy on Level 107?
13899/0:Looks like things got a little out of hand here.
13900/0:Jesus Christ!
13901/0:...but I saw it in the news, all of Chicago, gone...
13902/0:Looks like things got a little out of hand here.
13903/0:Good God, look at that!
13904/0:Looks like things got a little out of hand here.
13905/0:Good God, look at that!
13906/0:Looks like things got a little out of hand here.
13907/0:Must be some sort of trick.
13907/1:I'm not THAT stupid...
13908/0:How did that move?
13909/0:Must be some sort of trick.
13909/1:I'm not THAT stupid...
13910/0:How did that move?
13911/0:Careful.  Could be a trick.
13912/0:How did that move?
13913/0:Careful.  Could be a trick.
13914/0:How did that move?
13915/0:Tryin' to block my view, huh?
13916/0:
13917/0:Now where did it go?
13918/0:Tryin' to block my view, huh?
13919/0:Now where did it go?
13920/0:I'd really like to hear about my home town.
13921/0:Sure, take out the Templars.  [500]
13922/0:
13923/0:That's what I like to hear....  Oh, but by the way, I'd like to clarify something about our contract.
13924/0:What's so great about this club anyway?
13925/0:
13926/0:You're suing your own company, and the owners don't want the truth to come out in court.
13927/0:What's your problem?
13927/1:Sheesh.
13928/0:I drink what I like.  I don't try to make some sort of political statement with it.
13929/0:What's your problem?
13929/1:Sheesh.
13930/0:Huh?
13930/1:Hello?
13930/2:Maybe something's up.
13931/0:What's your problem?
13931/1:Sheesh.
13932/0:What's your problem?
13932/1:Sheesh.
13933/0:What's your problem?
13933/1:Sheesh.
13934/0:Was that supposed to be a diversion?
13935/0:You need work, you go to the Pit.  This is what I did.  I found work.  Mercenary.  Black market.  In a few hours, they send me to Egypt.  You said you never heard of Leo Jankowski?  Well, you just wait.
13936/0:Now where did it go?
13937/0:What's your problem?
13937/1:Sheesh.
13938/0:Was that supposed to be a diversion?
13939/0:Now where did it go?
13940/0:What's your problem?
13940/1:Sheesh.
13941/0:Whoa, what went on here?
13941/1:Must've been some fighting...
13942/0:I don't think that's where it should be.
13943/0:What's your problem?
13943/1:Sheesh.
13944/0:Whoa, what went on here?
13944/1:Must've been some fighting...
13945/0:Tell Sid it's time for him to get back to work.
13946/0:I don't know exactly what I'm guarding, but I know it's of no interest to you. 
13947/0:I don't think that's where it should be.
13948/0:I've had enough.
13948/1:I don't need any more of this today.
13949/0:Looks like there was some shooting.
13950/0:I don't think that's where it should be.
13951/0:I've had enough.
13951/1:I don't need any more of this today.
13952/0:Looks like there was some shooting.
13953/0:I don't think that's where it should be.
13954/0:Wonder what kind of gun leaves burn marks like that...
13955/0:Which means me.
13956/0:That took a beating.
13957/0:Wonder what kind of gun leaves burn marks like that...
13958/0:That took a beating.
13959/0:A caster bolt.  Great.
13960/0:That took a beating.
13961/0:A caster bolt.  Great.
13962/0:You wouldn't dare.
13963/0:That took a beating.
13964/0:What sponsor?  The company I'm supposed to go to work for?
13965/0:Templar HQ is very pleased with the research and development of the armor you've done here in Cairo.
13966/0:I've got more important things to do with my time than gossip.
13967/0:You've already uploaded the Aquinas specification.  All I need you to do is make sure both Denton brothers have been neutralized and their machine destroyed.  The world doesn't need any new gods.
13968/0:
13968/1:
13968/2:
13968/3:
13968/4:
13969/0:
13969/1:
13970/0:The central office will be thrilled.  They'll believe it was my shop that convinced her.  Let me show you my gratitude with a little something from the Lost-and-Found -- a biomod canister probably left here by one of those little rakes from the Tarsus school.  Those kids are an infestation -- always playing spy games in the office suites.
13971/0:Oh.  Really?
13972/0:Go.  History is waiting to be made.
13973/0:Well, I don't want to end up workin' for some feeb in a vat of salt water.
13974/0:Maybe Panzerwerks mechs aren't all they're cracked up to be.
13975/0:
13976/0:I've had enough.
13976/1:I don't need any more of this today.
13977/0:Omar adaptations will soon encompass every climate and biohazard on Earth -- and many more environments that may exist elsewhere.  You have earned preferred customer status -- a fifty percent reduction in prices.
13978/0:I've had enough.
13978/1:I don't need any more of this today.
13979/0:I've had enough.
13979/1:I don't need any more of this today.
13980/0:Very perceptive.  You look like one of those of Tarsus kids who hang around here.  They'd do the job -- maybe just lob a grenade in there or something.  Interested in a little adventure?
13981/0:I've had enough.
13981/1:I don't need any more of this today.
13982/0:I've had enough.
13982/1:I don't need any more of this today.
13983/0:A throwing knife.  Great.
13984/0:Actually, I --
13985/0:Wow -- someone destroyed that.
13986/0:I've had enough.
13986/1:I don't need any more of this today.
13987/0:A throwing knife.  Great.
13988/0:The money will be deposited in your WTO credit account.  Mr. Nassif, trust me.  We will make sure nothing happens to Eeva.
13989/0:Wow -- someone destroyed that.
13990/0:I've had enough.
13990/1:I don't need any more of this today.
13991/0:Someone there?  Huh, they don't usually act up like that.
13992/0:Sit tight.  I'll be right back.
13993/0:Wow -- someone destroyed that.
13994/0:I've had enough.
13994/1:I don't need any more of this today.
13995/0:Someone there?  Huh, they don't usually act up like that.
13996/0:Wow -- someone destroyed that.
13997/0:I've had enough.
13997/1:I don't need any more of this today.
13998/0:Oh great -- it's malfunctioning.
13999/0:I've had enough.
13999/1:I don't need any more of this today.
14000/0:It's dead...
14001/0:Oh great -- it's malfunctioning.
14002/0:
14003/0:Oh great -- it's malfunctioning.
14004/0:It's out cold... Weird.
14005/0:Oh great -- it's malfunctioning.
14006/0:Someone must've powered this down.
14007/0:Oh my god!  The poor thing's on fire!
14008/0:Someone must've powered this down.
14009/0:I can't reveal anything more.  Be informed, however, that when I locate my passenger, you will have to hire another pilot.
14010/0:Are you certain?  A threat to Purity like this must not be tolerated.  We must identify new targets...
14011/0:They said I was sick, but in one of those power-armor suits, which they're getting ready to run off an assembly line... in one of those suits I'm as good as ANY MAN.
14012/0:He didn't even have a chance.  He was just standing there...
14013/0:
14013/1:
14013/2:
14013/3:
14013/4:
14014/0:Huh.
14015/0:Lay off, lady... Jeez.  I'm just sellin' passes.
14016/0:Why should I join a group which is at war with itself?
14017/0:I can tell you what happened to your lawsuit.
14018/0:Nah, not yet.  I've got things to do.
14019/0:This has been another... ta-a-alk BULLET!
14020/0:For God's sake, leave me alone.  Yes, I have closed the greenhouse.  There was a murder there -- the murder of my brother.  The greenhouse will stay closed until I am certain that the Nassif family is safe.
14021/0:Nice talking with you.
14022/0:If you leak anything to the press, don't mention my name.
14023/0:Right, I heard about your helicopter.  How'd you get this call past WTO security?
14024/0:I don't have time for this.
14024/1:Take your nonsense somewhere else.
14025/0:I don't have time for this.
14025/1:Take your nonsense somewhere else.
14026/0:I don't have time for this.
14026/1:Take your nonsense somewhere else.
14027/0:I don't have time for this.
14027/1:Take your nonsense somewhere else.
14028/0:I've been following the ApostleCorp investigation very closely.  Your loyalty in this matter would be a great asset.  However, we have a more pressing crisis.  Her Holiness is missing, along with my security chief, Donna Morgan.  I can't be distracted right now.
14029/0:Take your nonsense somewhere else!
14029/1:I do not have time for this!
14030/0:Someone must've powered this down.
14031/0:I don't have time for this.
14031/1:Take your nonsense somewhere else.
14032/0:A dead cat... not my problem.
14033/0:Someone must've powered this down.
14034/0:I don't have time for this.
14034/1:Take your nonsense somewhere else.
14035/0:Very well done.  The schematic has already proven useful.  We have learned that the armor contains a weak spot, triangular in shape, on the back.
14036/0:Now why is this open?
14037/0:I don't have time for this.
14037/1:Take your nonsense somewhere else.
14038/0:A dead bird... not my problem.
14039/0:Goodbye.
14040/0:Now why is this open?
14041/0:I don't have time for this.
14041/1:Take your nonsense somewhere else.
14042/0:Let's do this.
14042/1:Take your best shot.
14043/0:Now why is this open?
14044/0:I don't have time for this.
14044/1:Take your nonsense somewhere else.
14045/0:+voice:orderguardfemale2 +austin
14045/1:Some hacker's got control of it!
14045/2:What's got into this thing?
14046/0:Now why is this open?
14047/0:Shouldn't this be open?
14048/0:A dead rat... not my problem.
14049/0:Just making the usual rounds.
14050/0:Shouldn't this be open?
14051/0:Shouldn't this be open?
14052/0:Hm-hm.  Somebody opened it.  // pleased with her acuity
14053/0:I've got deadlines!  And I'm going to miss my connection because of this.
14054/0:Shouldn't this be open?
14055/0:Too bad.  Stop back when your cashflow's better.
14056/0:It's an unusual assignment, but I'm committed to carrying it out. Let's go.
14057/0:Attention citizens: Flight Bay 24 is closed until further notice.  The space has been leased to a private organization.
14058/0:Yes -- this is the Cairo branch of your old alma-mater.  No need to investigate further.  You already know the location of the secret ApstleCorp facility.
14059/0:
14060/0:ApostleCorp made your biomods.  I'm not blaming you, but the technology diverges wildly from Piezochem biomods, the only ones approved for sale.
14061/0:We will bring you more details as they become available.
14062/0:
14062/1:
14062/2:
14063/0:
14064/0:If anybody screwed up today, it was us.  Security.
14065/0:I don't have time for this.
14065/1:Take your nonsense somewhere else.
14066/0:I don't have time for this.
14066/1:Take your nonsense somewhere else.
14067/0:Hey -- watch where you're going.
14067/1:You bumped me!  Back off.
14067/2:Oh!  Am I in the way?
14067/3:Watch where you put your feet.
14068/0:Hey -- watch where you're going.
14068/1:You bumped me!  Back off.
14068/2:Please look where you are going.
14068/3:You stepped on my foot.
14068/4:Am I in your way?
14069/0:Hey -- watch where you're going.
14069/1:You bumped me!  Back off.
14070/0:Hey -- watch where you're going.
14070/1:You bumped me!  Back off.
14071/0:Hm-hm.  Somebody closed it.  // pleased with her acuity
14072/0:Hey -- watch where you're going.
14072/1:You bumped me!  Back off.
14073/0:That wasn't on -- I don't think.
14074/0:I am not a Seeker, but I hope she does not get hurt.  Who knows what would happen then?
14075/0:Hey -- watch where you're going.
14075/1:You bumped me!  Back off.
14076/0:That wasn't on -- I don't think.
14077/0:Hey -- watch where you're going.
14077/1:You bumped me!  Back off.
14078/0:That wasn't off -- I don't think.
14079/0:Thank you.  You've put my mind at ease.
14080/0:Hey -- watch where you're going.
14080/1:You bumped me!  Back off.
14081/0:That wasn't off -- I don't think.
14082/0:Completely destroyed.... Wow.  Now what?  // to self
14082/1:Hm, might be outgunned this time...
14083/0:It's okay, Chief Morgan, we can tell her the truth.
14084/0:Completely destroyed.... Wow.  Now what?  // to self
14084/1:Hm, might be outgunned this time...
14085/0:Great -- vandals.
14086/0:JC is safer, but still he sleeps.
14087/0:Great -- vandals.
14088/0:You have no reason to hate us, Alex.
14089/0:Stop your attacker with a stun prod, an electromagnetic boltcaster, a pistol, dual-action shotgun, or SMG machine gun.
14090/0:Is that what you plan to tell corporate headhunters?  "What the hell?"
14091/0:Huh?
14092/0:What, you gonna liberate the arcology before I can finish a cup of coffee?
14093/0:If you kill me, JC will never let you leave the island alive.
14094/0:Good work.  You found an alternate way in.
14095/0:You're wrong.  Everything I've built -- including you -- was meant to ensure the survival of humanity.  Like it or not, intelligent life WILL evolve to the next level, with or without us.
14096/0:Wrong answer.
14097/0:Hey -- watch where you're going.
14097/1:You bumped me!  Back off.
14097/2:Hey - watch it!
14097/3:Look out.
14097/4:Ouch!  Jerk...
14098/0:Hey -- watch where you're going.
14098/1:You bumped me!  Back off.
14098/2:Shove off.
14098/3:Hey, pay attention to what you're doing!
14099/0:It will be hazy and overcast Outside, so it is safest to remain inside the Arcology's atmospheric barriers.
14100/0:Hey -- watch where you're going.
14100/1:You bumped me!  Back off.
14101/0:Hey -- watch where you're going.
14101/1:You bumped me!  Back off.
14101/2:Clumsy, aren't you?
14101/3:That was my foot...
14102/0:My guess is that it was a botched infusion.  Justice, if you ask me.  Mother Nature's way of saying, "Don't play with that."
14103/0:Ouch!  Not funny.
14103/1:You're not making any new friends.
14104/0:Ouch!  Not funny.
14104/1:You're not making any new friends.
14105/0:Do NOT touch me.
14106/0:Ouch!  Not funny.
14106/1:You're not making any new friends.
14107/0:Ouch!  Not funny.
14107/1:You're not making any new friends.
14108/0:Ouch!  That is not funny.
14108/1:You are not making any new friends.
14109/0:Ouch!  Not funny.
14109/1:You're not making any new friends.
14110/0:Funny way to end up a free agent.
14111/0:How much of you is a machine?
14112/0:Use of extreme force is permitted.
14113/0:It would be a start.  I'm so sick of these nobodies expecting me to do special favors for them and not even having a few credits to compensate me for my trouble.  What about you?  Are you just a fan or do you have a good reason for bothering me?
14114/0:Got fired.  Again.  Time to start drinkin'.
14115/0:Yes, our organization is indeed the ancient order of the Knights Templar.
14116/0:Alliance:  Illuminati.  We are pleased you have chosen the Light.
14117/0:Hi.  I'm NG Resonance.  What would you like to talk about, Alex?
14118/0:Can't carry anything else right now.  Hold on.
14119/0:It's me again.
14120/0:Proceed to your destination.
14121/0:
14122/0:Ouch!  Not funny.
14122/1:You're not making any new friends.
14123/0:Ouch!  Not funny.
14123/1:You're not making any new friends.
14124/0:If it was ME, I'd hire a smuggler.  Someone with some experience, you know.  Then the WTO Air Patrol could kiss my ass.  Best place for that sort of thing is the Greasel Pit.  It's just on the other side of the Inclinator tunnel.
14125/0:Ouch!  Not funny.
14125/1:You're not making any new friends.
14126/0:So they centralize wealth with the WTO and ideology with the Order.  What about power?
14127/0:The renewed anti-WTO rioting in Germany has some world leaders issuing warnings about a possible civil war.
14128/0:Ouch!  Not funny.
14128/1:You're not making any new friends.
14129/0:Ouch!  Not funny.
14129/1:You're not making any new friends.
14130/0:Hello there.  Alex, from the Tarsus Program, right?  Good work on the interrogation of Dr. Nassif in Cairo.  Teleportation, is it...?    ApostleCorp must have a line on some alien technology.
14131/0:There are many dissatisfied with the WTO who come here seeking true fulfillment.
14132/0:Ouch!  Not funny.
14132/1:You're not making any new friends.
14133/0:Stop looking at me like that.
14133/1:We haven't met, now stop looking at me.
14133/2:Do you want something?
14133/3:I know you are looking at me.
14133/4:Lost?
14134/0:Stop looking at me like that.
14134/1:We haven't met, now stop looking at me.
14134/2:What do you want?
14134/3:Are you aware that you are staring?
14134/4:Don't look at me like that.
14135/0:I distrust your motives.
14136/0:Stop looking at me like that.
14136/1:We haven't met, now stop looking at me.
14137/0:I didn't think you'd have the guts.
14138/0:So let's see what's for sale...
14139/0:Stop looking at me like that.
14139/1:We haven't met, now stop looking at me.
14140/0:We're just here to make sure the crowd doesn't get too rowdy.
14141/0:Well, don't think we're all fanatics about that stuff.  You won't see ME taking any mods, but, you know, to each his own.  My unit got sent down here to see if we could find an unlock control for the Denton bunker.  Figures we'd get jumped by a bunch of mutants.  I'm the only one left.
14142/0:He probably doesn't even understand our research.  At his level, I suppose it's just a commodity to be bartered away.
14143/0:I was on my way out when they hacked the security.
14144/0:It sounds like the missionaries to the enclaves will get to live there.  My family would like that.
14145/0:No worries, hun.  But fair warning -- don't expect a ride back to Seattle.  This town's burned me one too many times.
14146/0:
14146/1:
14147/0:Stop looking at me like that.
14147/1:We haven't met, now stop looking at me.
14148/0:
14149/0:Stop looking at me like that.
14149/1:We haven't met, now stop looking at me.
14150/0:Stop looking at me like that.
14150/1:We haven't met, now stop looking at me.
14151/0:I don't deal with recruitment.
14152/0:Stop looking at me like that.
14152/1:We haven't met, now stop looking at me.
14153/0:This gig is working out.
14154/0:Stop looking at me like that.
14154/1:We haven't met, now stop looking at me.
14154/2:Yeah?
14154/3:Uh...yeah?
14155/0:Home is no better.  The stuff comes through the seams of the windows and through the crack under the door.
14156/0:Stop looking at me like that.
14156/1:We haven't met, now stop looking at me.
14156/2:How would you like ME to stare at YOU?
14156/3:Do I have food on my face or something?
14157/0:Stop looking at me like that.
14157/1:We haven't met, now stop looking at me.
14158/0:You also know that Queequeg's Coffee imports exclusively from independent coffee growers from around the world.
14159/0:Stop looking at me like that.
14159/1:We haven't met, now stop looking at me.
14159/2:Zoning out?
14159/3:Are you waiting for something?
14160/0:This is WTO Security Chief Donna Morgan.  Your were instructed to report to the air terminal.  Very well.   You can make yourself useful at the Inclinator instead.  There's been a toxic spill which has shut down operations.  The hazard flush system or a nanoformer bot that could clean up the mess, but the maintenance team is blocked from using either.  For more details, talk to the facility director in her office.
14161/0:Stop acting like a freak.
14161/1:You're behaving like a fool.
14161/2:None of that, okay?
14161/3:Not a good idea...
14161/4:Why are you doing that?
14162/0:In Cairo, maybe so.  I've been trying to reach Trier, Germany, our last hidden base, but all lines are down.  I found out that the leader of that cell is a man named Tracer Tong.  He's the only one who can contact JC.  If you insist on tracking down our leaders, you can hire a pilot at the Pequod's on Level 107 and go to Trier.
14163/0:Stop acting like a freak.
14163/1:You're behaving like a fool.
14163/2:We have police in this area, you know...
14163/3:You shouldn't be doing that...
14163/4:I don't understand... What are you doing?
14164/0:Thanks for the tip.
14165/0:
14166/0:You must be private security for one of the factions.
14167/0:Thank God, she's all right.  Good work.  My people will secure the facility.  In the meantime, we should follow up on what Her Holiness learned about Luminon Saman.  Go to the tavern and hire a pilot.  If you wouild like a map of Saman's compound, report to the SSC Station on your way across town.
14168/0:It doesn't look good for us...
14168/1:We're getting overpowered...
14169/0:I don't have time for smalltalk.  Take me back to downtown Trier.
14170/0:We will need the Denton body for the experiment.
14171/0:My well-being, my life -- for a handful of credits.  What is this world coming to?
14172/0:
14173/0:I'm sure Chief Morgan knows what she's doing.
14174/0:Are you going to pay his debt or bring me his head?
14175/0:Thank goodness Archer is where he can't hurt anyone.
14176/0:They came in the night.  I couldn't see their faces.  Now Garai, my brother... Well, at least it was over quickly.  There's no such thing as police anymore -- just thugs with uniforms.
14177/0:Stop acting like a freak.
14177/1:You're behaving like a fool.
14178/0:Stop acting like a freak.
14178/1:You're behaving like a fool.
14179/0:Meet the others yet?  They're both upstairs, I think.
14180/0:Stop acting like a freak.
14180/1:You are behaving like a fool.
14181/0:Stop acting like a freak.
14181/1:You're behaving like a fool.
14182/0:Maybe it's just a drill.
14183/0:Stop acting like a freak.
14183/1:You're behaving like a fool.
14184/0:Stop acting like a freak.
14184/1:You're behaving like a fool.
14185/0:Stop acting like a freak.
14185/1:You're behaving like a fool.
14185/2:Hey!  I don't think you're supposed to mess with that...
14185/3:Ummm... what are you doing?
14186/0:Stop acting like a freak.
14186/1:You're behaving like a fool.
14186/2:Hey -- that's not a good idea...
14186/3:Stop messing with that.
14186/4:What's wrong with you?
14187/0:Part of it, maybe.  The Templars have cells all over the medina.  The key will be knowing in advance when the strike is going to happen.
14188/0:Stop acting like a freak.
14188/1:You're behaving like a fool.
14189/0:Stop acting like a freak.
14189/1:You're behaving like a fool.
14189/2:You're a weirdo, aren't you?
14189/3:You better stop that...
14189/4:Hold on there!
14190/0:I wouldn't have to deal in firearms if people still used lawyers like they used to.
14191/0:You startled me there.  Guess I'm a little preoccupied.
14192/0:... yes... at last...
14193/0:Enough for now.  Please leave me to my thoughts.
14194/0:Mako Ballistics is honeycombed with small research teams like ours -- tentacles of outside corporations, seeds of new ones, internal factions.
14195/0:That's the main entrance.  You'll either need the access code or explosives to get inside.
14196/0:
14197/0:You arrive.  Good.  I am here to assist.
14198/0:Stay true, young Pliable.  Now go to -- Wait!  Must be an overload... or a self-destruct sequence.  A blast door just sealed off the only exit.  You'll be trapped unless you can kill the power with the control box on the south wall -- or destroy the exposed conduits.  I guess the technician who worked here was a little paranoid about hackers.
14199/0:Just melt away and re-group.  That's war in the post-territorial world.
14200/0:I'm not willing to take that risk, but you guys are trained for that sort of thing.  I'm just supposed to be quietly observing students and taking notes, from behind the glass.  Hopefully back-up will show up soon and rescue me, but you don't have that luxury -- you cannot let yourself be captured!
14201/0:I don't think you're ready to back up that threat.
14201/1:No need to get hostile.
14202/0:Go back to your apartment.  You'll be able to get to the biomod lab through a breach the Order made in the residential area.
14203/0:Query:  Subject D is reliably allied to Illuminati?
14204/0:I don't think you're ready to back up that threat.
14204/1:No need to get hostile.
14205/0:I don't think you're ready to back up that threat.
14205/1:No need to get hostile.
14206/0:I don't think you're ready to back up that threat.
14206/1:No need to get hostile.
14207/0:No need to get hostile.
14207/1:I do not think you are ready to back up that threat.
14208/0:I don't think you're ready to back up that threat.
14208/1:No need to get hostile.
14209/0:I don't think you're ready to back up that threat.
14209/1:No need to get hostile.
14210/0:I don't think you're ready to back up that threat.
14210/1:No need to get hostile.
14211/0:Nice talking with you.
14212/0:I don't think you're ready to back up that threat.
14212/1:No need to get hostile.
14213/0:We still don't know where he stashed the mods.  Maybe if you hadn't been so hot to kill him, we could've captured and interrogated him.
14214/0:I don't think you're ready to back up that threat.
14214/1:No need to get hostile.
14215/0:If anyone's a glaring target for Templar paladins, it's a biomodified commando like yourself.
14216/0:Well, I hope I didn't steal your thunder.  When you get to the encampment, you'll probably come across his dead body.
14217/0:You're cleared to go about your business.
14218/0:I wonder what will happen next...
14219/0:Get out of Upper Seattle while you can.  The WTO could decide to arrest you at any moment.  You can reach the lower districts via the Inclinator at the northwest corner of the enclave.
14220/0:
14221/0:
14222/0:Luminon Saman's inflammatory rhetoric is widely believed to have caused the recent unrest in Trier, Germany.  But did adherents to an extreme brand of Order philosophy in Europe carry out a strike in the center of the American heartland?
14223/0:JC is waiting.  He will need to transmit your profile.  How can I help?
14224/0:I grew up in post-Collapse Hong Kong.  My parents were Max Chen and Maggie Chow, conspirators involved with MJ-12.  I swore I would never ruin myself with lies the way they did.
14225/0:I'm plagued by spies -- even in here.
14226/0:My pleasure.  I can't wait to see the faces of those self-satisfied arcology feebs when Pequod's shuts down and I take over the coffeeshop on Level 107.
14227/0:No worries, scally.  But fair warning -- don't expect a ride back to Seattle.  This town's burned me one too many times.
14228/0:Sure you don't want to reconsider?  You could become a very powerful woman, Alex.  With biomodification technology properly regulated, you would be the forerunner of a new elite.
14229/0:I don't think you're ready to back up that threat.
14229/1:No need to get hostile.
14230/0:I don't think you're ready to back up that threat.
14230/1:No need to get hostile.
14231/0:I don't think you're permitted in this area.
14231/1:No trespassing.
14232/0:I don't think you're permitted in this area.
14232/1:No trespassing.
14233/0:I don't think you're permitted in this area.
14233/1:No trespassing.
14234/0:Nice...
14235/0:I don't think you're permitted in this area.
14235/1:No trespassing.
14236/0:No trespassing.
14236/1:Really, that is enough!
14237/0:I don't think you're permitted in this area.
14237/1:No trespassing.
14238/0:I don't think you're permitted in this area.
14238/1:No trespassing.
14239/0:I don't think you're permitted in this area.
14239/1:No trespassing.
14240/0:Talk to the Chicago Project Director.  He's on the other side of the biolab.  I'm pretty sure he ran the trials, but he doesn't tell us much.
14241/0:Don't worry -- if they trace this thing to you I'll play like I never met you.
14242/0:I'm freezing my ass off out here.  The Omar shut down my enviro-suit remotely.  What are we gonna do?
14243/0:I'm Lin-May Chen, High Augur to Her Holiness.  We can't protect you in Upper Seattle.  You will have to come to our church, then we can talk more.
14244/0:Actually, I'm looking for work.
14245/0:When I say that to people, they laugh and call me naive.
14246/0:C'mon, let's show 'em who's boss.
14246/1:Templars!  
14246/2:Into battle!
14247/0:C'mon, let's show 'em who's boss.
14247/1:Templars!  
14247/2:Into battle!
14248/0:I coulda got killed...
14249/0:C'mon, let's show 'em who's boss.
14249/1:Templars!  
14249/2:Into battle!
14250/0:Apparently Saman trusts you.
14251/0:Destroy that abomination.
14251/1:How vile!  Kill it!
14252/0:(cough cough)  Why won't they at least let us in the city?
14253/0:Destroy that abomination.
14253/1:How vile!  Kill it!
14254/0:JC is counting on you, Alex.
14255/0:My disappointment with you is beyond words, Alex.  Chairman Dumier himself was depending on that interrogation.  You are on the verge of making some very powerful enemies.
14256/0:Good advice.  Well, it's been nice chatting...
14257/0:Destroy that abomination.
14257/1:How vile!  Kill it!
14258/0:Take care of that freak!
14258/1:Destroy that monstrosity!
14259/0:Take care of that freak!
14259/1:Destroy that monstrosity!
14260/0:Take care of that freak!
14260/1:Destroy that monstrosity!
14261/0:Now you've got groups like The Order who are making more trouble every day BECAUSE of the WTO, especially their more extreme members.
14262/0:Thanks for taking care of the Mosque for us.
14263/0:I don't think Mrs. Withers is going to be taking bribes anytime soon.
14264/0:The woman from Seattle -- yes.  Where are you from?  New Cairo?  Why come here?  The air in the medina is polluted.
14265/0:And?
14266/0:Can you forgive them?
14267/0:Hmph.  Terrorists.
14268/0:What for?  You a spy?
14269/0:Tarsus Tracking Report 1351 -- Leo Jankowski.  Last seen in Cairo, among the Omar.  First assassination attempt, unsuccessful.  He is still alive.  Unclear, the nature of his relationship with the cyborgs.  Appears to be a simple mercenary, but the Omar will study his biomod technology.  Recommend upgrade to Omar threat classification.
14270/0:We've got to get out of here.
14271/0:Did the Templars use the portal?  How could they, unless one of the other trainees --
14272/0:
14272/1:
14272/2:
14272/3:
14272/4:
14273/0:Probably sounds paranoid... but I hope I can still have children.
14274/0:Blow her away.
14275/0:Ni-i-i-i-ce.... Appreciate the hospitality, flyboy.
14276/0:Blow her away.
14277/0:
14278/0:Blow her away.
14279/0:Bad break for both of us, huh?
14280/0:Blow him away.
14281/0:Blow him away.
14282/0:Blow him away.
14283/0:I'm on it.
14283/1:Right away.
14283/2:I'LL take care of it.
14284/0:I'm on it.
14284/1:Right away.
14284/2:I'LL take care of it.
14285/0:I'm on it.
14285/1:Right away.
14285/2:I'LL take care of it.
14286/0:
14286/1:
14286/2:
14286/3:
14286/4:
14286/5:
14286/6:
14286/7:
14287/0:I'll be happy when this is all over...
14287/1:What were they THINKING?
14287/2:Gotta stay alert.
14287/3:Maybe I could set up some target practice...
14287/4:Gotta get promoted out of this stuff...
14287/5:I guess you have to start somewhere.
14287/6:I guess somebody had to take this post.
14288/0:They may have stopped Archer, but they cannot stop our quest for Purity.  We must obliterate the Nassif bloodline.  Immediately.
14289/0:Cover me when I charge him?  I mean, I can handle it by myself.  It's just that in training, we always had back-up.
14290/0:Where are my SMGs?
14291/0:You're probably here for the fights.  Well, that spit-contest ain't fightin'.
14292/0:I TOLD 'em they should lock this place down.
14293/0:Incidentally, I have recently found reason to doubt Miss Klara Sparks' loyalty.  We are depending on YOU, Alex.  Only a Denton or one of the trainees can use the Gate.
14294/0:You took your own sweet time, didn't you?
14295/0:Chicks never listen when I say I run freight.
14296/0:Yes.  My enemies seek to establish States, but they forget to heed Plato's good advice -- do not fail to convince the children that the gods are incapable of lying.  But the children's eyes are open.  Are you ready to exorcise the second souls of modified humans, young paladin?
14297/0:Our numbers still dwindle, but there are more important conflicts at hand.
14298/0:I hope I'm not too late!
14299/0:You deaf?
14300/0:I'll be happy when this is all over...
14300/1:Long shift...
14300/2:I haven't seen her in so long.
14300/3:...and it wasn't even my fault...
14300/4:I think these boots have had it.
14300/5:We need more women in this outfit.
14300/6:I guess this is it, finally -- the front lines...
14300/7:Too many new faces... they can't all be sincere.
14300/8:Hmm.  They stitched me up pretty good...
14300/9:How dare they question MY devotion...
14300/10:Guess I'll file a report on HER...  Hmph.
14300/11:Fits like a glove...
14300/12:Someone should start a Templar news letter...
14300/13:They're takin' over the planet...
14301/0:I'll be happy when this is all over...
14301/1:What were they THINKING?
14301/2:Maybe a transfer-- but where?
14301/3:At least I was finally deployed...
14301/4:They didn't tell me.
14301/5:I wish I could get better assignments...
14301/6:That reminds me...
14301/7:The fight is going well.
14301/8:Long hours... it'll be worth it.
14301/9:(sigh) Too many against us.
14301/10:The new equipment is working out...
14302/0:(cough)
14302/1:(sniffle)
14302/2:(snort)
14302/3:(stomach grumble)
14303/0:
14304/0:(cough)
14304/1:(sniffle)
14304/2:(snort)
14304/3:(stomach grumble)
14305/0:I already took care of Sak.  Maybe I should finish the job.
14306/0:(cough)
14306/1:(sniffle)
14306/2:(snort)
14306/3:(stomach grumble)
14307/0:Gotta do something about this rat problem already.
14308/0:Gotta do something about this rat problem already.
14309/0:Gotta do something about this rat problem already.
14310/0:You've already turned on the generator, so now you must upload the Sequencing Module from the Gate Control Room.
14311/0:Here kitty kitty.
14312/0:Here kitty kitty.
14313/0:
14314/0:Good luck with your search.  Whenever I'm looking for someone in Trier, I start at the Nine Worlds Tavern on the west side of the city.  Your odyssey is beginning to intrigue me, Alex.
14315/0:... Helios core... lower platform... nanite-capsid upgrate necessary... all five processing modules... go... lower platform... below...
14316/0:At least we're making progress.
14317/0:Hush!  Hush!  Let an old man have his pleasant thoughts.  Would you do me a favor?
14318/0:Roll-'em snake-eyes!  Lemme see you spit!
14319/0:I've got to find the fiend responsible for this.
14319/1:Whoever's committed this awful deed can't have gotten far.
14320/0:I've got to find the fiend responsible for this.
14320/1:Whoever's committed this awful deed can't have gotten far.
14321/0:I knocked that greasel out cold.  You sure you saw Gob-zilla?
14322/0:I've got to find the fiend responsible for this.
14322/1:Whoever's committed this awful deed can't have gotten far.
14323/0:Here kitty kitty.
14324/0:On your toes.  Someone's lurking about, knocking out Templars.
14325/0:Now is not the time for conversation.
14325/1:I can't talk right now!  It's too dangerous!
14326/0:On your toes.  Someone's lurking about, knocking out Templars.
14327/0:Now is not the time for conversation.
14327/1:I can't talk right now!  It's too dangerous!
14328/0:On your toes.  Someone's lurking about, knocking out Templars.
14329/0:Don't even think about coming in here.
14330/0:Now is not the time for conversation.
14330/1:I can't talk right now!  It's too dangerous!
14331/0:I'll avenge your death, noble one.
14331/1:Another paladin taken from us...
14332/0:Oh no!
14332/1:That was an accident.  Really.
14333/0:I'll avenge your death, noble one.
14333/1:Another paladin taken from us...
14334/0:Like I said, a pretty scabby part of town.  Pretty much abandoned except for the church to the northwest.  Maybe one of the squatters knows the area.
14335/0:Oh no!
14335/1:That was an accident.  Really.
14336/0:I'll avenge your death, noble one.
14336/1:Another paladin taken from us...
14337/0:Well... I didn't know there was a time limit.
14338/0:Oh no!
14338/1:That was an accident.  Really.
14339/0:Be careful whom you trust.  Only the Order can help you retain your individuality and find spiritual balance.  All others are suspect.
14340/0:That's enough.
14340/1:Cool it.
14340/2:Knock it off.
14341/0:Go back to preaching your nonsense.  I have no time for this.
14342/0:That's enough.
14342/1:Cool it.
14342/2:Knock it off.
14343/0:The human genome is most perfect in its purest form.  It should never be tampered with or polluted.
14344/0:Guess you guys pulled it off.
14345/0:That's enough.
14345/1:Cool it.
14345/2:Knock it off.
14346/0:Won't be long before one cult or another tries to force itself on EVERYBODY.  You better drink to that, young miss.
14347/0:A new face.  Interesting.  Introduce yourself.
14348/0:You sound pretty upset.
14349/0:No distractions, please.
14350/0:I had a run-in with the Templars in the apartment building across from the mosque.  Maybe I scared them off.
14351/0:Won't Mako just hand the project to another scientist?
14352/0:The bots will see you as an enemy threat -- keep that in mind.
14353/0:Soon everyone will share the nanites coursing through your veins.
14354/0:When the time comes, we must make the proper remembrances.
14355/0:So you have a theory about the Inclinator disaster?
14356/0:When the time comes, we must make the proper remembrances.
14357/0:Yeah, I dug that up.  I wonder if it'll hurt the Chairman's political career.
14358/0:When the time comes, we must make the proper remembrances.
14359/0:Good to see that abomination eliminated.
14359/1:One less freak...
14360/0:You will accord me the proper respect!
14360/1:Pay attention to where you're walking.
14361/0:Good to see that abomination eliminated.
14361/1:One less freak...
14362/0:Yeah?
14363/0:I don't think you're going to want to go much further, Alex.
14364/0:You will accord me the proper respect!
14364/1:Pay attention to where you're walking.
14364/2:Sorry.
14364/3:Ow!
14364/4:Oh, sure, come on through...
14365/0:Good to see that abomination eliminated.
14365/1:One less freak...
14366/0:How much of you is a machine?
14367/0:We'll have more fun if you pretend I'm NG.
14368/0:What's that?
14369/0:You will accord me the proper respect!
14369/1:Pay attention to where you're walking.
14369/2:Watch yourself.
14370/0:What's with these animals?
14370/1:The animals must sense something...
14370/2:Something must be going on...
14371/0:Improve your aim... or suffer the consequences.
14371/1:Watch where you're aiming, you fool.
14372/0:What's with these animals?
14372/1:The animals must sense something...
14372/2:Something must be going on...
14373/0:Would you like to make a purchase?
14374/0:Improve your aim... or suffer the consequences.
14374/1:Watch where you're aiming, you fool.
14375/0:What's with these animals?
14375/1:The animals must sense something...
14375/2:Something must be going on...
14376/0:Improve your aim... or suffer the consequences.
14376/1:Watch where you're aiming, you fool.
14377/0:Look at how upset these animals are.
14378/0:It's impolite to stare.
14378/1:I don't appreciate being ogled.
14379/0:It's impolite to stare.
14379/1:I don't appreciate being ogled.
14379/2:+austin
14379/3:Step back, please.
14379/4:I don't like the looks of you, either.
14379/5:Are you lost?
14380/0:I saw 'em go in, dressed like a bunch of loony-tunes.
14381/0:It's impolite to stare.
14381/1:I don't appreciate being ogled.
14381/2:Go on about your business.
14381/3:You are interested in our Order?
14381/4:You do not seem quite... pure.
14382/0:Bother someone else.
14382/1:I am not amused by your behavior.
14382/2:What IS your problem?
14383/0:I said I wanted it locked down.  Your team was supposed to be evacuated ten minutes ago.
14384/0:Let me finish my run.
14385/0:I guess Max got his fill of action today.
14386/0:No offense, but I don't want any of your nanites near me.
14387/0:Vmail sender replied:
14388/0:Make sure they bring a mop.
14389/0:No screwin' around now, or I'll have to take you out back and work you over with a crowbar.... (laugh)  Just kiddin'!  Have a good time.
14390/0:Look at how upset these animals are.
14391/0:Look at how upset these animals are.
14392/0:I wonder what startled that poor cat.
14393/0:You will each be interviewed individually in the near future to determine your interests and how they position you within the company.  Please keep in mind how important security has become.  We are looking for assurances that moving you into these new positions is the right thing at this time.
14394/0:I wonder what startled that poor cat.
14395/0:Just wanted the chance to give you a quick execution.
14396/0:Bother someone else.
14396/1:I am not amused by your behavior.
14396/2:What IS your problem?
14396/3:Tch!  Takes all kinds.
14396/4:That belong to you?
14396/5:Huh!
14397/0:I wonder what startled that poor cat.
14398/0:Bother someone else.
14398/1:I am not amused by your behavior.
14398/2:What IS your problem?
14398/3:Ahem.  Not advisable.
14398/4:This isn't your own personal playground.
14398/5:What are you doing?
14399/0:What kind of person bothers strays like this?
14400/0:You're kidding right?
14400/1:Do you know who you're messing with?
14401/0:What kind of person bothers strays like this?
14402/0:Thanks.  Good luck with the new branch.
14403/0:
14404/0:You're kidding right?
14404/1:Do you know who you're messing with?
14405/0:What kind of person bothers strays like this?
14406/0:You're kidding right?
14406/1:Do you know who you're messing with?
14407/0:Ho-lee shit!  That cat's on fire!
14408/0:This is a restricted area.  Move along before I move you myself.
14408/1:You're not permitted to be here.
14409/0:Ho-lee shit!  That cat's on fire!
14410/0:This is a restricted area.  Move along before I move you myself.
14410/1:You're not permitted to be here.
14411/0:
14412/0:This is a restricted area.  Move along before I move you myself.
14412/1:You're not permitted to be here.
14413/0:I guess Her Holiness and Chairman Dumier think that if they can make peace in Trier, they can make peace anywhere.
14414/0:
14415/0:I'm really getting tired of your nonsense.
14415/1:Don't push it.
14416/0:Well, well.  An enclave kid come down to cruise the slums on Daddy's credit line.  First time at sea level?
14417/0:I wonder if these attacks mean another Collapse is going to happen.
14418/0:We must all bide our time.
14419/0:I'm really getting tired of your nonsense.
14419/1:Don't push it.
14420/0:I've got you covered.
14421/0:Already there, Chicago.
14422/0:What do I get if I bring you his head?
14423/0:Can I talk to Miss Sak?
14424/0:I can't pay that much for the ammo clip. [400]
14425/0:I had some of my best people guarding Her Holiness.  I don't know what could've happened.
14426/0:It's still the champ, I think.  They call it Gob-zilla.  Real cute.
14427/0:Yeah, you just move along there, young lady.
14428/0:This summit is just a giant photo opportunity for certain personalities.
14429/0:Her Holiness wants to help ALL humankind.
14430/0:We shouldn't waste our time chatting.
14431/0:Your bravery will be rewarded.
14432/0:The commodification of ability -- tuition, of course, but, increasingly, genetic treatments, cybernetic protocols, now biomods -- has had the side effect of creating a self-perpetuating aristocracy in all advanced societies.  When ability becomes a public resource, what will distinguish people will be what they do with it.  Intention.  Dedication.  Integrity.  The qualities we would choose as the bedrock of the social order.
14433/0:Interesting.
14434/0:Ho-lee shit!  That cat's on fire!
14435/0:Not today, but Chairman Dumier would like to speak with you.  He's in the interrogation room upstairs.  Don't worry -- no one's going to get interrogated.  Just a safety precaution.
14436/0:Ha!  Something must have tried to pounce on that rat.
14437/0:
14438/0:Ha!  Something must have tried to pounce on that rat.
14439/0:Alex, I'm here.  I took cover in the comm van by the UNATCO ruins.  Let's talk.  Time to decide who we're gonna bring down first.
14440/0:Ha!  Something must have tried to pounce on that rat.
14441/0:Nice facility.  You guys are lucky.
14442/0:I'm really getting tired of your nonsense.
14442/1:Don't push it.
14443/0:Looks like something spooked the pigeons.
14444/0:Your biomod architecture is no Piezochem clone.  The trainees' DNA has been completely rewritten.  We're certain that the one called Leo would have been ineligible for biomodification without extensive gene replacement.
14445/0:Watch it!
14445/1:Back off!  Or else!
14446/0:Looks like something spooked the pigeons.
14447/0:Watch it!
14447/1:Back off!  Or else!
14447/2:Clumsy freak...
14447/3:Off.  Now.
14448/0:Looks like something spooked the pigeons.
14449/0:
14449/1:
14449/2:
14449/3:
14450/0:Watch it!
14450/1:Back off!  Or else!
14450/2:You're pushing your luck.
14450/3:Not wise, my friend.
14451/0:Birds sure are agitated....
14452/0:You are about to cross the line and become my enemy.
14452/1:Pray you do not try my patience further.
14453/0:Birds sure are agitated....
14454/0:We've got what we came for. 
14455/0:You are about to cross the line and become my enemy.
14455/1:Pray you do not try my patience further.
14456/0:Birds sure are agitated....
14457/0:You could be a part of it.  Your fellow student from Tarsus, Klara Sparks, has already accepted a position here.  Think about it.  
14458/0:You are about to cross the line and become my enemy.
14458/1:Pray you do not try my patience further.
14459/0:Stop staring at ME!
14459/1:What ARE you looking at??
14460/0:Stop staring at ME!
14460/1:What ARE you looking at??
14460/2:You tryin' tp tic me off?  Go bug someone else.
14460/3:What?  Do I know you?
14461/0:So this is how it ends?  Okay.  I'm ready, but I don't think you are.  You may have dealt with SSC or even armored Templars before, but you've never taken on a true equal -- or a friend.  But I guess you're just as crazy as the rest of them, another threat to be neutralized.  It's over, Alex.
14462/0:Stop staring at ME!
14462/1:What ARE you looking at??
14462/2:Be careful who you spy on...
14462/3:Keep your distance.
14462/4:Don't test my patience.
14463/0:Maybe you should look for an alternate route.  This room might have a ceiling vent or something.
14464/0:Pilot beacon's still giving me a flatline.  Maybe those poor sods in the flight bay know what happened.
14465/0:We will transact again.
14466/0:It is true -- we have damaged Panzerwerks' equipment -- but we have never hurt any living being nor stolen from them.
14467/0:This suit gives me the same kind of skills and I can take it off at the end of the day.
14468/0:This is WTO Security Chief Donna Morgan.   You were told to report to the air terminal.  Very well, but do me a favor.  You just found some financial data that the enclave's Civic Manager is interested in.  I'm sure that he would be happy to give you a Citizen's Bonus if you reported it to him at the WTO Air Terminal.
14469/0:I thought this place was supposed to be a fortress.
14470/0:The missives said something about "Purification" -- I do not know what that means, but it sounds like he views the students here as inferior.
14471/0:Time again for a.... ta-a-alk BULLET!
14472/0:
14473/0:This bot's taken some damage recently.
14474/0:Also, once I'm in the air I'm not coming back to Seattle.  I'm sure you understand -- the authorities will be waiting for me.
14475/0:This bot's taken some damage recently.
14476/0:Be a good boy and run along now.
14477/0:This bot's taken some damage recently.
14478/0:I mean it.  If you want a medkit, it's yours.
14479/0:I'm your friend, Alex.  The more I know, the better I can protect you.
14480/0:Mark my words.  The day is coming when it's going to be us versus them.  Human beings versus the freaks.  You didn't see horse-head cyborgs walking around ten years ago.
14481/0:The Seekers sabotage Panzerwerks machinery in order to halt production and allegedly protect the natural environmental "order".
14482/0:Yeah, that's fascinating, but--
14483/0:It's a good gig, working in a bar in one of the enclaves.  No complaints here.
14484/0:I don't take it back, if that's what you mean.
14485/0:Thanks for your help.
14486/0:The bot's been shut down...  That's strange.
14487/0:Ah, Alex D.  Nice work resolving that situation in the Galleria.  The WTO appreciates your help keeping the peace in our enclave.  And Chief Morgan has had a lot to say about you.
14488/0:The bot's been shut down...  That's strange.
14489/0:Oh, the cyborg.  I already took him out.
14490/0:The bot's been shut down...  That's strange.
14491/0:So... you saying you want to bring the investigator into this matter?
14492/0:Something's wrong with that bot.
14493/0:No one informed me of such an occurrence.  You should assume that the concert started on schedule.  Hurry!  Don't forget -- you're on the guest list from when you helped me out in Upper Seattle.
14494/0:You have my appreciation.
14495/0:Oh.... Sorry, mate.  Just talkin' chuff.  No offense.
14496/0:Where at?
14497/0:Shall we conduct business, or shall we wait until you upload the schematics of the Templar power armor from the arcology hangar?
14498/0:The Omar do not take such actions lightly.  Had you aided us in the past, all alliances would now be nullified, but no such connection exists.
14499/0:Impossible.  NG grew up poor like the rest of us.  She won't put her name behind some fake corporate concoction like the Pequachino.
14500/0:Something's wrong with that bot.
14501/0:What are you doing down here?
14502/0:Something's wrong with that bot.
14503/0:I already paid you.
14504/0:Look at this!  Someone's damaged the bot.
14505/0:Look at this!  Someone's damaged the bot.
14506/0:Look at this!  Someone's damaged the bot.
14507/0:Say, what's with this door?
14507/1:Hmmm...  That door...  Someone must be snooping around.
14508/0:Welcome to Club Vox.  We've got the latest NG Resonance sim, the best music, and even a VIP Club for your more private exchanges.  You can pay the cover for the main club here. [100]
14509/0:Say, what's with this door?
14509/1:Hmmm...  That door...  Someone must be snooping around.
14510/0:
14510/1:
14510/2:
14510/3:
14510/4:
14510/5:
14510/6:
14511/0:Things are pretty hectic in the HQ offices now.
14512/0:It's false advertising if the product doesn't exist, right?  I would like to know why the authorities are ignoring this situation.
14513/0:What does it matter, as long as I have customers?
14514/0:He your brother or something?  Huh.
14515/0:Ask for a new reason to be locked up for two years?  No.  Come!  I am going!
14516/0:Out.
14517/0:By the skull of Sidon, where did he go?
14518/0:By the skull of Sidon, where did she go?
14519/0:By the skull of Sidon, where did she go?
14520/0:I have done my best to explain this summit to them.  Frankly, it seems unlikely even to me that the Church followers will ever countenance the closed, monolithic communities of the WTO, but I suppose that's a matter for the wise discretion of Her Holiness.
14521/0:Nothing to see here.
14522/0:Say, what's with this door?
14522/1:Hmmm...  That door...  Someone must be snooping around.
14523/0:This is what we've been working toward, ever since I uncovered the truth about UNATCO and MJ-12, even if I didn't realize it at the time.  I trust his vision.
14524/0:This door shouldn't be open.
14524/1:I wonder how this door got open.
14525/0:This door shouldn't be open.
14525/1:I wonder how this door got open.
14526/0:Welcome to Pequod's, coffee for the stars.
14527/0:This door shouldn't be open.
14527/1:I wonder how this door got open.
14528/0:This door shouldn't be closed.
14528/1:Door's closed?  Strange...
14529/0:This door shouldn't be closed.
14529/1:Door's closed?  Strange...
14530/0:I really don't understand why my classmates are so easily amused and distracted.
14531/0:This door shouldn't be closed.
14531/1:Door's closed?  Strange...
14532/0:Someone really wanted to get past this door.
14532/1:That door's been destroyed!  Someone's up to no good.
14533/0:Someone really wanted to get past this door.
14533/1:That door's been destroyed!  Someone's up to no good.
14534/0:Someone really wanted to get past this door.
14534/1:That door's been destroyed!  Someone's up to no good.
14535/0:That'll show the sneaky beggars not to sidestep trade regulations.  Good work.
14536/0:Blah blah blah
14537/0:Beats runnin' with a bunch low-town scabs, I guess.
14538/0:Finish him off!  None of us will be safe until he's dead.
14539/0:Your compensation will be access to our markets.
14540/0:Slick guy like you?  You could come up with the cash if you really wanted to.
14541/0:Some people like to gamble.  Me?  I just like to win.
14542/0:Because I think Her Holiness is a fiction.  That's right -- a fiction.  Why doesn't she show her face when she appears in public?
14543/0:Well, they will.  The whole point of an enclave is to be self-sufficient.  Once they're established, they'll crash a helicopter into the Inclinator and blame it on a drunk smuggler.
14544/0:
14545/0:I'm ready.
14546/0:It looks like someone may have been playing with the lights.
14546/1:What's with the lights around here?
14546/2:I wonder what's going on with the lights.
14547/0:I do kinda miss the frisking though...
14548/0:It looks like someone may have been playing with the lights.
14548/1:What's with the lights around here?
14548/2:I wonder what's going on with the lights.
14549/0:It looks like someone may have been playing with the lights.
14549/1:What's with the lights around here?
14549/2:I wonder what's going on with the lights.
14550/0:I wonder how this got turned off.
14550/1:This area should be lit.
14551/0:The Mako facility north of town.  Who do you work for?  You mentioned a mission...
14552/0:Why this family?
14553/0:I wonder how this got turned off.
14553/1:This area should be lit.
14554/0:Alex D.  The information you provided our agent was incorrect.  The Omar trader in the medina has been assassinated.  Your future business with the Omar will remain on unfavorable terms.
14555/0:I wonder how this got turned off.
14555/1:This area should be lit.
14556/0:Finish off JC Denton and step into his machine.  My scientists will modify your nanite architecture into a delivery vehicle for our cellular defense mechanism.
14557/0:I wonder who turned this on...
14557/1:This area should be dark.
14558/0:I wonder who turned this on...
14558/1:This area should be dark.
14559/0:I wonder who turned this on...
14559/1:This area should be dark.
14560/0:Sorry.
14561/0:Well, we fight gobs down here.  Green gobs, brown gobs, baby-stealin' sewer-slinkin' good-eatin' gobs, follow me?  Right now it's Green Dragon in the north chute, Shutterbug in the south.  Walk around, check the fighters, then let me know where you want to put your money.
14562/0:At least I'm straightforward.  Aren't you concerned what your disciples will do when they find out you've been lying to them?
14563/0:
14563/1:
14563/2:
14563/3:
14563/4:
14564/0:Any idea what's going on around here?  This Dr. Nassif is telling me to ignore what sounded like an explosion and I just saw a man killed in the hallway.
14565/0:
14565/1:
14565/2:
14565/3:
14566/0:Lucky they didn't go after the air terminal.  I'm supposed to pick someone up.
14567/0:Excuse me?
14568/0:So?
14569/0:Enjoy your new technologies.
14570/0:Having grown up poor, I appreciated the Tarsus school, and when ApostleCorp came to me and said they wanted to get rid of the enclave-mentality that keeps the rich behind walls and the poor -- like my relatives in the medina -- scrabbling in the dirt -- I couldn't refuse.
14571/0:
14571/1:
14571/2:
14571/3:
14572/0:Thanks.  ApostleCorp must be a pretty serious threat to be a concern to the Director of the WTO.
14573/0:Stay here and defend the area against your enemies.
14574/0:
14574/1:
14574/2:
14575/0:
14575/1:
14575/2:
14575/3:
14576/0: I wonder where that smoke is coming from.
14576/1:Hmm... Smoke...
14577/0:I wonder where that smoke is coming from.
14577/1:Hmm... Smoke...
14578/0: I wonder where that smoke is coming from.
14578/1:Hmm... Smoke...
14579/0:Blood...
14579/1:I'd say this blood is a sign I've got company.
14580/0:I can't carry anything else right now -- hold on.
14581/0:I have nothing more to say to someone like you.
14582/0:You will infiltrate the New Cairo arcology.  I will do the same and join you prior to the assault.
14583/0:Blood...
14583/1:I'd say this blood is a sign I've got company.
14584/0:Blood...
14584/1:I'd say this blood is a sign I've got company.
14585/0:The shadows are flickering.
14585/1:Something... in the shadows...
14586/0:The shadows are flickering.
14586/1:Something... in the shadows...
14587/0:Thanks for sticking around.  What are the chances that you could take me to Cairo?
14588/0:Travel outside arcology walls is discouraged.  Particulate matter levels are severe.  Always wear breathing equipment when you have business in the medina.
14589/0:Do this for the Templars, then help us reconfigure JC's contraption to disburse a nanite-capsid predator, and we will end the plague of biomodification once and for all.
14590/0:Shhhh.  Just tell me if they can go ahead and set up the fight.
14591/0:The Templars restrict access to their facilities.  Flight Bay 24 is not a public airport.  As soon as you've filled out all the necessary paperwork, they'll be glad to give you a complete tour.
14592/0:I'm a diplomat.  I speak kindly to all, but I choose my friends based on their actions alone.
14593/0:We need answers now.
14594/0:So the WTO wants you to steal the Mag Rail schematics.  Don't be fooled.  They will monopolize the technology for their own security forces.  The Order asks that you kill the scientist who developed the gun.  We will send Mako a message.  Such work breeds nothing but strife and suffering.
14595/0:I don't know how much more I can take.  I just received word that my uncle was murdered.
14596/0:Alex!  What are you doing?  You shouldn't be nosing through classified SSC material.  Don't tell me that fool who runs the coffeeshop put you up to this.  His lawsuit is pending.  That's all he needs to know.
14597/0:The exterminator obviously isn't going to show up, so the fee's yours if you get the job done.
14598/0:When you're ready to go, just open the door.  The automatic weapons reactivation systems take care of everything.
14599/0:The WTO wishes no harm to come to Her Holiness. This summit was to be an opportunity to soothe the tensions between our organizations and to root out the extremists causing trouble in Trier.
14600/0:Later, babe.
14601/0:The shadows are flickering.
14601/1:Something... in the shadows...
14602/0:You killed my brother.  Am I next?  Or have you reconsidered?
14603/0:Hmm... Fire.
14603/1:Something's burning...
14604/0:Hmm... Fire.
14604/1:Something's burning...
14605/0:Hmm... Fire.
14605/1:Something's burning...
14606/0:Time again for a.... ta-a-alk BULLET!
14607/0:By Sidon, it looks like there's been a recent exchange of fire here.
14607/1:Hmmm...  This zone saw gunplay not too long ago.
14607/2:At least whoever was involved doesn't have very good aim...
14608/0:By Sidon, it looks like there's been a recent exchange of fire here.
14608/1:Hmmm...  This zone saw gunplay not too long ago.
14608/2:At least whoever was involved doesn't have very good aim...
14609/0:By Sidon, it looks like there's been a recent exchange of fire here.
14609/1:Hmmm...  This zone saw gunplay not too long ago.
14609/2:At least whoever was involved doesn't have very good aim...
14610/0:Those are pretty big words for a rookie.  Go ahead.  You first.  I'll bring up the rear.
14611/0:Someone sure shot this place up.
14612/0:Nassif owes us an explanation.  For everything.
14613/0:It's called Plague 11.  You must not be from around here.
14614/0:Someone sure shot this place up.
14615/0:I think you know how to stand around and look pathetic.
14616/0:Someone sure shot this place up.
14617/0:
14617/1:
14618/0:It's now used for classified research.  Apparently the Templars are funding one of the projects.
14619/0:What would this "pure democracy" look like?
14620/0:Any economic system designed for millions of people soon begins to live for its own sake.
14621/0:Seek the way, my friend.
14622/0:I do have my own army, you know.
14623/0:I've already done my own investigating there.  
14624/0:Don't get to thinking this could be a full-time gig.  Mr. O'Rourke doesn't keep assassins on the payroll.
14625/0:
14626/0:Trust me, three is never a crowd... Now chop-chop.  Here is the key to the back stairwell of my penthouse.  Stay in the kitchen until I arrive, or the bot will take offense.  I live at the Emerald Suites.  You can get to the hotel's lobby from the upper sidewalk.
14627/0:What, you gonna liberate the arcology before I can finish a cup of coffee?
14628/0:Oh no you don't -- I'm not letting you off so easy.
14628/1:Enemy taking flight!
14629/0:Oh no you don't -- I'm not letting you off so easy.
14629/1:Enemy taking flight!
14630/0:I want human affairs to be driven by wisdom.  Finding the correct recipe for wisdom has been my project these long years under the ice.
14631/0:Use of extreme force is permitted.
14632/0:Emergency lockdown in progress.
14633/0:He's trying to escape!
14634/0:You know an awful lot about police business.
14635/0:I'm showing another entry for Alex D in the crime database.
14636/0:My associate will answer your questions.
14637/0:
14638/0:The Omar moved into Trier a few months ago.  I knew I had to adapt or get out of town.
14639/0:Of course she is.  That was my precise purpose in sending you to save her -- so that you would believe me when I say that we face a great danger.  The Illuminati have been very successful at re-shaping the post-Collapse world.  Control of our technology would allow them to create a handpicked ruling elite.
14640/0:We're getting reports that Her Holiness is considering the offer, but this is what she had to say to reporters a moment ago:
14641/0:Ah, you seek solace from your everyday troubles.
14642/0:Time again for a.... ta-a-alk BULLET!
14643/0:Give me the energy cells. [300]
14644/0:He's trying to escape!
14645/0:Don't let him out of your sight.
14646/0:What do you know about JC?
14647/0:Don't let him out of your sight.
14648/0:Have you lost your mind?  You ensured his safety from the Templars only to murder him yourself.
14649/0:
14650/0:She's trying to escape!
14651/0:She's trying to escape!
14652/0:Don't let her out of your sight.
14653/0:My chopper is ready when you are.
14654/0:Don't let her out of your sight.
14655/0:You couldn't hit the broad side of a barn!
14655/1:Bah!  Nice aim!  //sarcastic
14656/0:You couldn't hit the broad side of a barn!
14656/1:Bah!  Nice aim!  //sarcastic
14657/0:Bah!  Biomods...
14657/1:Those mods will only lead to your demise, freak.
14657/2:How can you live like that, with your body so corrupted?
14658/0:Another archaic analogy?
14659/0:At last, Order has triumphed.
14660/0:Well, all right.  I'll give you a few seconds to take cover once you leave the locker room, then I'll try to draw the Seeker's fire.  Just keep your head down.  You never know what's gonna happen when the shooting starts.
14661/0:I hereby annul your Knighthood.  Without a test subject, my technicians can't verify our counter-nanite and will have to release it blind.  You may find yourself responsible for a plague like nothing the world has ever known.
14662/0:2226 is some slimey lawyer.
14663/0:I would think that you and ApostleCorp would be bitter enemies.
14664/0:Looks like you've stumbled across messages from the Versalife team.  When the net went black, they must've been utterly stranded here... Isolated from the world, trapped with the transgenics, running out of food -- it can't have been pretty.  I wonder if any managed to escape.
14665/0:
14666/0:That landing pad is run by a local smuggler, Sophia Sak.  Looks like they seized Sid Black's harrier -- probably as payment for phony debts.  It never hurts to have a pilot who owes you a favor.  You could pay the debt or -- better -- eliminate Sak and her henchmen for the good of the whole neighborhood.
14667/0:Soon, darkness and pollution will threaten humankind no more.
14668/0:That'll show the sneaky beggars not to sidestep trade regulations.  Now look around for clues to Dr. Nassif's location.  Perhaps she was aided by her family.
14669/0:I don't blame you for what happened in Cairo.
14670/0:Bah!  Biomods...
14670/1:Those mods will only lead to your demise, freak.
14670/2:How can you live like that, with your body so corrupted?
14671/0:Save the attitude, D.  The Pit pays.  Here you go -- double your money.  House takes ten percent.
14672/0:The target's modified.  How vile.
14672/1:Looks like we're dealing with a real freak here.
14673/0:The target's modified.  How vile.
14673/1:Looks like we're dealing with a real freak here.
14674/0: The target is cloaking.
14675/0: The target is cloaking.
14676/0:Fight your own battles, coward.
14677/0:Fight your own battles, coward.
14678/0:So I see that they've replaced your mind with a rifle barrel.
14679/0:Nevermind.  I'll stay out of it.
14680/0:So I see that they've replaced your mind with a rifle barrel.
14681/0:Oh I see your game -- a speed mod.
14682/0:
14683/0:
14684/0:Conspiracy theories appeal only to those who need an easy explanation for their problems.
14685/0:
14686/0:Mmmm.  Too bad.
14687/0:I will not miss the school in the medina.  It is in a warehouse, and the teachers are all Seekers.
14688/0:Oh well.  The superior product will have to prevail over glitz and subterfuge.
14689/0:Thank you for your help.
14690/0:Watch it, Alex!  I think I saw a sniper on the roof!
14691/0:Ni-i-i-i-ce.... Appreciate the hospitality, plumcake.
14692/0:No way, man.  I think they already got him with a barrel or a crate.
14693/0:I don't even care WHAT it is they're transporting in there, just as long as the WTO gets their cut.
14694/0:You get tired of talkin' to the same idiots day after day.
14695/0:
14695/1:
14696/0:Well!  They say WE'RE intolerant -- hmp!
14697/0:
14698/0:Oh I see your game -- a speed mod.
14699/0:The Order teaches us to put our humanity first -- a value that should not need to be argued or preached at all.
14700/0:I think this one may be fooling the bot's sensors.
14701/0:I wanna join.  Sign me up.
14702/0:I think this one may be fooling the bot's sensors.
14703/0:Seriously?
14704/0:The body must be dead, or we won't be certain of our enemy's fate.
14705/0:You know what you've been asked to do.
14706/0:Now what?
14707/0:Remember:  Bots are programmed to neutralize any unidentified individuals.
14708/0:Then I won't be letting you in.
14709/0:Nice shot.
14709/1:Good eye.
14709/2:Heck, yeah.
14710/0:Nice shot.
14710/1:Good eye.
14710/2:Heck, yeah.
14711/0:Yeah, now you're showing her who's boss.
14712/0:
14712/1:
14712/2:
14712/3:
14713/0:The Hateful Ones are here, with others to destroy.  We must protect JC's plan.
14714/0:Open your eyes!  The Order is a designer religion, calculated to attract the largest number of believers.
14715/0:Alex, I'm afraid something happened in Chicago -- a terrorist attack.  We evacuated you and Billie just in time.
14716/0:That's what you think.
14717/0:I hope the Omar don't go after my family.
14718/0:You're right next to a vent shaft.  If you don't mind getting a little dirty, it can give you access to other parts of the laboratory and let you bypass security.
14719/0:Someone views us as the new plague.
14720/0:People should realize -- the more trouble they cause, the longer it's going to take the WTO system to spread out to the rest of society.
14721/0:In the bull's eye today -- Luminon Saman, formerly of the Order Church.  So you've gone public with a NEW con-game, I hear.  What's it called...?  Uh --
14722/0:
14723/0:I can't stand them.  So disfigured... They are the worst offenders against human Purity.
14724/0:Yeah, now you're showing her who's boss.
14725/0:I don't take any satisfaction in killing.  He's done me a favor by dying prematurely.
14726/0:Both of us are targets here.  We will work separately until the final phase of the operation.
14727/0:Yeah, now you're showing him who's boss.
14728/0:I don't get it.  These new fights -- they're just a couple of starved lizards at each other's throats.
14729/0:Yeah, now you're showing him who's boss.
14730/0:My little girl... my poor little girl...
14731/0:That's how it's done.
14731/1:Purity prevails. 
14731/2:Sure, you step in at the last minute, and steal all the glory.
14732/0:That's how it's done.
14732/1:Purity prevails. 
14732/2:Sure, you step in at the last minute, and steal all the glory.
14733/0:So?
14734/0:Huh?
14735/0:We're taking damage over here.
14735/1:We've got an injury here!
14736/0:We're taking damage over here.
14736/1:We've got an injury here!
14737/0:That vile beast just attacked a Templar.
14737/1:Look out.  That monster means business.
14738/0:That vile beast just attacked a Templar.
14738/1:Look out.  That monster means business.
14739/0:That freak just hit a Templar.  Show no mercy!
14740/0:You're getting on my nerves.
14741/0:"Was?"
14742/0:Have faith.  The Order Church condemns the illegal biomodification experiments performed on you and the other trainees.
14743/0:Hm.  It's gone.
14743/1:Guess I better figure out where it's gone....
14744/0:Hm.  It's gone.
14744/1:Guess I better figure out where it's gone....
14745/0:Excellent.  My scientists on Ophelia will -- Wait!  Must be an overload... or a self-destruct sequence.  A blast door just sealed off the only exit.  You'll be trapped unless you can kill the power with the control box on the south wall -- or destroy the exposed conduits.  I wish we'd hired the technician who worked here to handle security in Trier.
14746/0:
14747/0:(growl)  Guess it's gonna be me who has to clean that up.
14747/1:Somebody throwing things...
14748/0:Really?  Maybe I should look into this...
14749/0:(growl)  Guess it's gonna be me who has to clean that up.
14749/1:Somebody throwing things...
14750/0:I didn't get a chance to read the file.
14751/0:Wonder how it got there...
14751/1:Someone left a mess.  Great.
14752/0:Wonder how it got there...
14752/1:Someone left a mess.  Great.
14753/0:That freak just hit a Templar.  Show no mercy!
14754/0:Give me the key to penthouse's back stairwell.
14755/0:That wasn't acting up before...
14756/0:I will make the enemy answer for this!
14756/1:(yells) It's too horrible.
14757/0:That wasn't acting up before...
14758/0:Wonder why it's offline...
14759/0:I will make the enemy answer for this!
14759/1:(yells) It's too horrible.
14760/0:Wonder why it's offline...
14761/0:Show no mercy -- it just killed a Templar.
14762/0:Show no mercy -- it just killed a Templar.
14763/0:Change of plans?
14764/0:
14764/1:
14764/2:
14764/3:
14765/0:Coward!  Come back here!
14765/1:How can you desert like this?!
14766/0:Gimme what you got.
14767/0:I have work to do in Cairo.
14768/0:Coward!  Come back here!
14768/1:How can you desert like this?!
14769/0:Onward to Purity!
14769/1:Soon, another Templar victory.
14770/0:Good advice.  Well, it's been nice chatting...
14771/0:I grew up in post-Collapse Hong Kong.  My parents were Max Chen and Maggie Chow, conspirators involved with MJ-12.  I swore I would never ruin myself with lies the way they did.
14772/0:
14772/1:
14772/2:
14773/0:Onward to Purity!
14773/1:Soon, another Templar victory.
14774/0:You never WERE very loyal.  Why start now?
14775/0:I told you we'd make quick work of this.
14775/1:Soon, victory will be ours.
14776/0:NG is a spoonfed fool.  She doesn't care who uses her image or for what purpose.
14777/0:Mmm, what do I see?  An exceptional young woman.  Modified, correct?  Lovingly grown in an enclave -- and now you step into the dangerous world.  Stay ready, Tarik.
14778/0:At first, the WTO meant planes always on schedule, more choices when you went shopping, more jobs...
14779/0:Leo...
14780/0:You're wasting time.  I want you to locate the Aquinas specification inside UNATCO.  When Helios has recovered its Hub privileges, you'll step into the infusion chamber, and the nanites in your body will be replicated in the air and ultimately in the bloodstreams of every last human being.
14781/0:You programmed the biomods?
14782/0:Thanks, I'll take the Frag Rounds Mod.
14783/0:As you wish.  I'm looking for someone named Billie Adams.  I heard she's in this mosque.
14784/0:Someone in Threat Assessment is getting his ass kicked once I get back.
14785/0:Did someone just turn off that light?
14786/0:Did someone just turn off that light?
14787/0:That's impossible.  The arcology's been seized by Templar paladins.
14788/0:Please -- speak with me.  I can explain what has come to pass.
14789/0:Glad I ain't payin' the utilities...  Hmm.  Weird.
14790/0:Glad I ain't payin' the utilities...  Hmm.  Weird.
14791/0:Might be a break-in.  Guess I better check it out.
14791/1:Thought that door was closed...
14792/0:Might be a break-in.  Guess I better check it out.
14792/1:Thought that door was closed...
14793/0:That door was open last time I looked...
14794/0:That door was open last time I looked...
14795/0:Blown to smithereens -- someone's gonna have my butt for this...
14796/0:Blown to smithereens -- someone's gonna have my butt for this...
14797/0:
14798/0:SSC's right  -- all it takes to do this job is a little training and a cool head.
14799/0:Doesn't sound like you believe in your work.
14800/0:Leo...
14801/0:
14802/0:I knew we could count on you, Alex.
14803/0:With a few post-natal recombinations, yes.  But our work has moved away from clones...
14804/0:You picked the wrong person to mug, punk.
14805/0:I already took care of her guards.  Maybe I should finish the job.
14806/0:Hop in.
14807/0:I won't stop you, but I can't ensure you'll be safe from the toxic materials or the bots.  If I was you, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of those bots unless I was armed to the teeth with EMP weapons.  I tried to take a bot out with a shotgun one time.  Fat chance.
14808/0:We will transact again.
14809/0:Fine.  Have it your way.
14810/0:There's the generator.  Simply bring it on-line, and the pilot beacon will begin receiving power.
14811/0:You must be the captain who goes down with the ship.
14812/0:Enough chit-chat.  I've got to think through my business plan.
14813/0:Bots comin' and goin' all day.  The arcology wouldn't set all of this up if it didn't do SOME good.
14814/0:Great, now I've got a fire to deal with.
14815/0:Great, now I've got a fire to deal with.
14816/0:Something's smoking.
14817/0:Something's smoking.
14818/0:Blood!
14818/1:Hm.  That blood hasn't dried yet.
14819/0:Blood!
14819/1:Hm.  That blood hasn't dried yet.
14820/0:A shadow...
14820/1:Something blocking the light...
14821/0:See you right outside.
14822/0:A shadow...
14822/1:Something blocking the light...
14823/0:The only killers I've seen so far are your Order troopers.
14824/0:Your turn, killer!
14824/1:Payback time!
14825/0:Tough break about Chicago.  I guess you knew people there.
14826/0:People are DYING in there.  Let me do my job.
14827/0:My interest is in adapting social systems to the facts of human nature.  That principle is the cornerstone of all of my thinking.
14828/0:As you wish.  I just stopped by to talk to a friend of mine, Billie Adams.  She's working with the Order Church.
14829/0:Doesn't sound like you believe in your work.
14830/0:(whine)  Quit.  I need to rest.
14831/0:You're in the game, D.  Now get in there and shake your pom-poms for the Claw.  He'll be comin' out the south chute!
14832/0:My Seekers, you must activate your Kundalini, or your spiritual energy. As you purify your spirit in your search for true order, it will ascend from one spiritual center, or chakra, in your bodies to another. As it reaches your higher chakras, you will gain new insights, bringing your lives into deeper Order.
14833/0:
14834/0:Who's been huntin' mutants?
14835/0:Who's been huntin' mutants?
14836/0:Someone damaged the bot.
14837/0:Someone damaged the bot.
14838/0:A foolish mistake.  I've put ApostleCorp's plans in great jeapardy.
14839/0:This area has been secured.
14840/0:Here you go.  Just be careful -- that's the Culture Minister's place and he tends to entertain a lot.
14841/0:You're inside.  Good.  The Sequencing Module should be stored on Saman's private computer.  More when you reach the Luminon's command area.
14842/0:It was somewhere... right over here...
14842/1:Hey, be ready.  I'm countin' on you.
14842/2:No one's giving US the slip.
14843/0:A body!
14843/1:(sigh) Now it's personal.
14843/2:Oh, boy, this looks serious.
14844/0:A body!
14844/1:(sigh) Now it's personal.
14844/2:Oh, boy, this looks serious.
14845/0:Wow, out cold...
14845/1:Still breathing -- the brute who did this can't be far...
14846/0:Wow, out cold...
14846/1:Still breathing -- the brute who did this can't be far...
14847/0:Alex, the WTO and Order are not as they seem...  They are but different faces of the same organization -- the Illuminati, an ancient secret society to which Chad and I are the heirs.  My mother was the Illuminatus Beth DuClare.  The WTO and Order are merely the tools Chad and I are presently using to elevate humanity to the next level.
14848/0:You sure are a curious young woman.
14849/0:Gonna have to be pretty quick to scrip' Flyball Freddie.
14850/0:Hard to say.  Maybe an hour.
14851/0:
14852/0:No solicitors.  Violators will be prosecuted and/or shot.
14853/0:In an uncertain world... Where the rule of law seldom reaches beyond city walls... Where businesses must look after themselves...
14854/0:What's the latest gossip?
14855/0:Her Holiness was correct, in the beginning, to describe the problem as one of human growth.  Human growth was impeded in the old society.  "Almost all men carry out the purposes of other men, rather than their own, making them feel impotent in action."  Bertrand Russell.
14856/0:It's not too late.  Just because you took one assignment for the WTO doesn't mean that the Order won't accept you.  Talk to Lin May.  The Order needs your help and has its own interests in the Mako facility.
14857/0:At least this assignment is almost finished.
14858/0:Lovely.  See you at the terminal.  Level 110, Flight Bay 23.  My jet's on a secure landing pad, so you'll have to contact me with the pilot beacon in the northeast corner of the main terminal.
14859/0:We've got a chance to make it now.
14860/0:That's what happens when people can't find work.  They have too much time to sit around and start believing who-KNOWS-what.
14861/0:
14862/0:Amicably, to be sure.  It's mostly a doctrinal dispute that stands between us.
14863/0:Have a good day.
14864/0:
14865/0:It's not too late to reform the Church.
14866/0:You must know everybody in the club.
14867/0:Thank God... He's still alive!
14868/0:Thank God... He's still alive!
14869/0:Well, I'm glad you pulled through.  That's some bad luck, though.  You won't have the chance to eavesdrop on the recruiting kiosk after something like that, which is what we need -- the specifics about the raid.
14870/0:Thank God... She's still alive!
14871/0:Exactly.  Your underlying mission will be to locate her.  If perfected, the biomod architecture she gave you, being adaptable to any host, could bring biomodification to everyone and unbalance the very concept of the human being.  But we have an additional favor to ask.
14872/0:Thank God... She's still alive!
14873/0:You trying to make a quick buck or something?
14874/0:(gasp) A corpse!
14874/1:No, it can't be... I shoulda been here to stop it.
14875/0:(gasp) A corpse!
14875/1:No, it can't be... I shoulda been here to stop it.
14876/0:Somebody knocked out a guard.
14877/0:Somebody knocked out a guard.
14878/0:Hey!  Who did this?
14878/1:Oh God... I'm too late.
14879/0:No more caprice in determining the course of human affairs.
14880/0:We should leave.
14881/0:Hey!  Who did this?
14881/1:Oh God... I'm too late.
14882/0:I already took care of Sak.  Maybe I should finish the job.
14883/0:Oh.  Well, that explains it, then.  I have a couple of drinks here every night, and every night I go home to an empty penthouse.
14884/0:Thought there might be some trade in refugees.  You know, quick hops away from trouble, but there hasn't been enough action yet for people to start liking my rates.  What about you?
14885/0:You will appreciate our merchandise.
14886/0:You're an impressionable young man.  Do you have any idea what you just liberated from the ice?  No matter.  The brother, Paul, is in my custody, and such he will stay.
14887/0:I'm pretty good... definitely a better artist than I ever was a secretary.
14888/0:I don't believe that they've really resorted to dark, murderous rituals.
14889/0:Easy does it.  This officer was murdered.
14890/0:Easy does it.  This officer was murdered.
14891/0:+voice:orderguardfemale2 +austin
14891/1:He can't have just disappeared.
14891/2:Stay in earshot.  Yell if you see him.
14892/0:+voice:orderguardfemale2 +austin
14892/1:Stay in earshot.  Yell if you see her.
14892/2:Jeez. She just vanished.
14893/0:You may pass.
14894/0:You're asking me to join the Templars?
14895/0:JC sleeps no longer.  The Hateful Ones have failed.
14896/0:Brilliant researchers... without an ounce of common sense.
14897/0:Demons?  Catch ME...?  (maniacal laugh)
14898/0:
14899/0:
14900/0:Huh?
14900/1:Eh?
14900/2:Oh?
14901/0:That's against the rules!
14902/0:I'm talking about the attack on Tarsus!  Is that what you do when people won't listen to your sermons?  You murder them?
14903/0:Good work -- you found Dr. Nassif's place.  Now see what you can learn.
14904/0:Your enemies know who you are.  You can't hide for long.
14905/0:Remember the Templar message.  The more you look at the world, the more truthful my words will seem.
14906/0:SSC's right  -- all it takes to do this job is a little training and a cool head.
14907/0:We were a Versalife experiment, then JC came and helped us.  This one is here, away from all the ice, to help with lab works...  but then the Templars came.
14908/0:Now you're talkin'.  I'll meet you there.
14909/0:I'll take the gas grenades. [600]
14910/0:I don't think you're permitted in this area.
14910/1:No trespassing.
14911/0:I don't think you're permitted in this area.
14911/1:No trespassing.
14912/0:I don't think you're permitted in this area.
14912/1:No trespassing.
14913/0:What?  Are you his boyfriend?  Let's see the money.  Hm.  Okay, then.  I guess we can find someone else.
14914/0:He seems overly concerned about loyalty -- loyalty to what, I'm not sure.
14915/0:I wish I could've afforded a REAL doctor.  The woman I saw?  She was more interested in hunting down the greasel than in fixing my toe.
14916/0:I don't think you're permitted in this area.
14916/1:No trespassing.
14917/0:Really, that's enough.
14917/1:C'mon, I don't need this today.
14918/0:Really, that's enough.
14918/1:C'mon, I don't need this today.
14919/0:All right.  I'm ready.
14920/0:Really, that's enough.
14920/1:C'mon, I don't need this today.
14921/0:
14922/0:Really, that's enough.
14922/1:C'mon, I don't need this today.
14923/0:Human society has been twisted and subverted by those blinded by false profits.  
14924/0:Good day.
14924/1:How do you do?
14924/2:Excellent weather, considering.
14925/0:Please, I do not need this today.
14925/1:Enough with this jostling.
14926/0:The Omar have a way of either absorbing or eliminating the competition.  O'Rourke was dipping from the emperor's well, or maybe I'd have brought him along.  You're either on the team, or you're off the team.  Know what I mean?
14927/0:Really, that's enough.
14927/1:C'mon, I don't need this today.
14928/0:A shower, a new suit of clothes, and you can't tell the terrorists from the people who LIVE here.
14929/0:I'd like to speak to the WTO Chairman.
14930/0:I heard that Her Holiness died.  I wonder what will become of the Summit.
14931/0:The Omar is not a human organization.  It's a self-replicating machine that grows itself around human bodies.  All we can do is buy time until we have a weapon to defeat the entire network.
14932/0:You always speak the truth, Your Holiness.
14933/0:
14934/0:Well, it looks like they did.
14935/0:Figures.  They get the all-clear and forget all about me.
14936/0:Eddie hired some scab to kill the Champ, but he won't get away with it.  I'll put out my own contract, one with his name on it.
14937/0:Say that again...?
14938/0:Don't let ApostleCorp or the Illuminati use you as a pawn.  One wants to worship JC and the other wants to try to control him.  Neither group can see he's too mad and too powerful for either.  I'm going to destroy him while he's still weak -- it's the only sane answer.  
14939/0:It's RED beams that trip alarms -- and green ones that trigger gas bombs.
14940/0:The client demands flawless security.  Shut the place down.
14941/0:
14942/0:So.  That's it.  Come to my city and insult our religious leaders...
14943/0:Here I am.  I keep on living, but why?
14944/0:Well, I was thinking.  The rumor is that Miss Withers is the one who makes decisions.  If I could find someone who would approach her, maybe offer her some money....
14945/0:Really, that is enough.
14945/1:Come on, I don't need this today.
14946/0:That should be off.
14947/0:Where is it?
14948/0:One life.  Insignificant, I would think, for the leader of the Illuminati.
14949/0:Really, that is enough.
14949/1:Please.  I do not need this today.
14950/0:That should be off.
14951/0:I understand everyone's concern about this, but there's really no reason to be worried.  I'm confident that it's just a youthful prank, and they'll soon turn up.  We have the best security here.  I'm sure there's been no foul play.
14952/0:Really, that's enough.
14952/1:C'mon, I don't need this today.
14953/0:That should be off.
14954/0:Really, that's enough.
14954/1:C'mon, I don't need this today.
14955/0:That should be off.
14956/0:Really, that's enough.
14956/1:C'mon, I don't need this today.
14957/0:Shouldn't this be on?
14958/0:Awaiting funds transfer...
14959/0:Really, that's enough.
14959/1:C'mon, I don't need this today.
14960/0:Shouldn't this be on?
14961/0:To be honest, though, I still don't trust you.  You let me down in Cairo.  My commandos will stay on high alert as they try to deal with the situation themselves.  Such will be the dictates of prudence until you prove me wrong.
14962/0:Enough with this jostling.
14962/1:You're really trying my patience with this.
14962/2:You stepped on my toe.
14962/3:I won't be shoved around.
14963/0:Shouldn't this be on?
14964/0:Good day.
14964/1:How do you do?
14964/2:Excellent weather, considering.
14965/0:Enough with this jostling.
14965/1:You're really trying my patience with this.
14965/2:Ow!  I won't be treated like that!
14965/3:Stop running into me.
14965/4:Go around.
14966/0:Shouldn't this be on?
14967/0:Enough with this jostling.
14967/1:You're really trying my patience with this.
14968/0:I can't get by!
14969/0:Oh, well, you know.  They're all over.  You have to be really careful at night because they shoot at anything.
14970/0:
14971/0:Enough with this jostling.
14971/1:You're really trying my patience with this.
14972/0:I can't get by!
14973/0:So -- you're performing in New Cairo.
14974/0:The Director has got to be having a fit right now.
14975/0:(cough)  (cough)
14976/0:Thanks.  This isn't much of a reward, but I guess I could give you a medkit.
14977/0:It looks like you decided this was the better deal.  Here's the code:  45103.  Now I'm taking off.
14978/0:I took out the cyborg.
14979/0:This raid is just a probing action.  The Order wants to find out what we're working on.
14980/0:The charges are pure fabrications -- it doesn't matter.  The lawyer is one Kevin O'Rourke. He lives in Suite 2226.  To be blunt, I want him dead.
14981/0:They have me in the hangar on the lower level.  Be prepared.  I am being guarded by a WTO security force.
14982/0:
14982/1:
14982/2:
14982/3:
14982/4:
14982/5:
14983/0:Uh... do I know you?
14984/0:
14985/0:Seekers?  More like sneakers....
14986/0:No one informed me of a cancellation.  I arrived at Flight Bay 23 just fourteen hours ago.
14987/0:Well, show up in New York and maybe you can help me sort all of this out.
14988/0:Heed my warning, tool.
14989/0:You are really trying my patience with this.
14989/1:What is your problem? That hurt!
14990/0:I can't get by!
14991/0:Enough with this jostling.
14991/1:You're really trying my patience with this.
14992/0:I can't get by!
14993/0:Enough with this jostling.
14993/1:You're really trying my patience with this.
14994/0:Door's stuck.
14995/0:Enough with this jostling.
14995/1:You're really trying my patience with this.
14996/0:Door's stuck.
14997/0:Enough with this jostling.
14997/1:You're really trying my patience with this.
14997/2:Klutz... Cut it out!
14997/3:Ouch!  Why I oughta...
14997/4:Back off.  I need room to breathe.
14998/0:Door's stuck.
14999/0:What are you selling?
15000/0:Some scientists.  It was more like a raid.
15001/0:Enough with this jostling.
15001/1:You're really trying my patience with this.
15001/2:Watch where you put your feet -- okay?
15001/3:Ouch... Hey, show a little respect.
15001/4:What's the matter -- blind?
15002/0:Door's stuck.
15003/0:Enough with this jostling.
15003/1:You're really trying my patience with this.
15004/0:Gotta move this myself.
15005/0:Enough with this jostling.
15005/1:You're really trying my patience with this.
15005/2:Have you always been this much of a klutz?
15005/3:Hey -- that hurt.
15005/4:Keep your hands to yourself!
15006/0:Gotta move this myself.
15007/0:Order be praised -- that woman was trying to run us out of town.  Now take care of her security force so that Sid can have his jet back.
15008/0:What is your problem?  That hurt.
15008/1:I'm not here for target practice.
15009/0:Gotta move this myself.
15010/0:What is your problem?  That hurt.
15010/1:I'm not here for target practice.
15011/0:Gotta move this myself.
15012/0:This is what the Illuminati wants you to do.  Destroy Paul Denton and help return biomod technology to international regulation.  Paul's frozen body is located in Flight Bay 24 on Level 110 of the arcology.  Don't be fooled into reviving that madman.  His destructive potential is second only to JC Denton's.
15013/0:The commando has been ordered to self-destruct when he finds the enemy.  This will destroy both of them and help the Illuminati seize some sort of device that's supposed to make them all-powerful.
15014/0:Right.  Well, I'll take out whoever you want for 500 credits.
15015/0:Time for you to run along, fangirl.
15016/0:What do you mean?
15017/0:Not now, friend.  We are discussing the crisis.  The Panzerwerks factory has erupted into a riot, and the violence is spreading.
15018/0:Brother Lamar spoke to me when he entered the enclave.  He and his Seekers are sworn followers of Her Holiness.  They would raise their hands in battle only if provoked.
15019/0:The pads are supposed to adjust automatically.
15020/0:
15021/0:I thought when I got this assignment it would be a quiet one.
15022/0:I have a black-market biomod canister, which enables non-Piezochem functionality.  I am also selling three energy cells for powering your biomodified systems.  Or you might want two EMP grenades, for disrupting electronic devices, such as surveillance equipment.  As a preferred customer, you may purchase items at half-market price.
15023/0:Well, maybe you can manage to take out that machine before we freeze to death.  I don't want to find out what the hell kind of world JC Denton was gonna give us.
15024/0:I'm glad I'm getting in the extra hours with this riot, but I'm ready for things to go back to normal now.
15025/0:Who are you -- some PR man coming to talk me out of it?  I will not give in.  Pequod's runs ads on the public terminal right across the street from my shop, and they don't even have a branch in Trier!
15026/0:Sounds like a plan to me.
15027/0:I wonder if Gob-zilla's still the Champ...
15028/0:What is your problem?  That hurt.
15028/1:I'm not here for target practice.
15029/0:That's too dangerous.  Better stay back.
15030/0:What is your problem?  That hurt.
15030/1:I'm not here for target practice.
15031/0:That's too dangerous.  Better stay back.
15032/0:I am not here for target practice!
15032/1:I really do not enjoy this attention!
15033/0:That's too dangerous.  Better stay back.
15034/0:What is your problem?  That hurt.
15034/1:I'm not here for target practice.
15035/0:That's too dangerous.  Better stay back.
15036/0:Shall we leave?
15037/0:What is your problem?  That hurt.
15037/1:I'm not here for target practice.
15038/0:What is your problem?  That hurt.
15038/1:I'm not here for target practice.
15039/0:One unidentified helicopter brings everything to a screeching halt?  Are you kidding?  Just shoot it down and move on.
15040/0:What is your problem?  That hurt.
15040/1:I'm not here for target practice.
15041/0:It took years of research and testing, but now we've got the cure.
15042/0:The body must be dead, or we won't be certain of our enemy's fate.
15043/0:Enjoying the view?
15043/1:Want me to flex for you, doll?
15044/0:What is your problem?  That hurt.
15044/1:I'm not here for target practice.
15045/0:Yeah -- I took care of that already.
15046/0:Excellent.  My technicians on Ophelia are already configuring the first operational Aquinas Hub in a generation... one which is in orbit and safe from tampering.  Now make sure that JC Denton is dead, and destroy his illegal machine.
15047/0:What is your problem?  That hurt.
15047/1:I'm not here for target practice.
15048/0:...in my sights...
15049/0:I don't believe we have anything more to discuss.
15050/0:You better not be pulling my leg.
15051/0:Like it or not, Alex, we need each other.  It won't be easy for me to forgive your behavior, but I will have to try.  I need you to tell me what you know about the terrorist attack that led to your escape from Tarsus Academy.
15052/0:What is your problem?  That hurt.
15052/1:I'm not here for target practice.
15053/0:...in my sights...
15054/0:I don't think the two are connected, though.
15055/0:I wish I had enough credits for the multitools. [400]
15056/0:Now I'm a big joke.  People say I lost everything cuz I was drunk.
15057/0:Saman has given us orders, including you.
15058/0:Tarsus Tracking Report 1351 -- Leo Jankowski.  Last seen in Cairo, among the Omar, before he was neutralized.  Appears to be a simple mercenary, but the Omar will have studied his biomod technology.  Recommend upgrade to Omar threat classification.
15059/0:Dr. Nassif should be here shortly.  She's actually been working with the subjects directly and I can hardly wait to ask her what they're like.
15060/0:Thinkin' you'll take the Oath?
15061/0:Get to work.
15062/0:I really don't enjoy this attention.
15062/1:Don't forget to blink.
15062/2:You are making me uncomfortable.
15062/3:I am going to ignore you.
15062/4:Stop staring!
15063/0:...in my sights...
15064/0:I really don't enjoy this attention.
15064/1:Don't forget to blink.
15064/2:I do not wish to be stared at.
15064/3:If you do not stop looking at me, I am going to become unpleasant.
15065/0:...in my sights...
15066/0:The service you performed for the Omar is appreciated.  Mr. O'Rourke, the smuggler in Emerald Suites apartment 2226, was a danger to the sect.
15067/0:I really don't enjoy this attention.
15067/1:Don't forget to blink.
15068/0:Omar adaptations will soon encompass every climate and biohazard on Earth -- and many more environments that may exist elsewhere.  You have earned preferred customer status -- a fifty percent reduction in prices.
15069/0:That takes care of one missile battery.  Now disable the one at the other corner of the building.
15070/0:I really don't enjoy this attention.
15070/1:Don't forget to blink.
15071/0:Maybe you should go rest. You're acting a bit odd.
15071/1:Do not forget to blink.
15072/0:I really don't enjoy this attention.
15072/1:Don't forget to blink.
15073/0:I hope that Panzerwerks has not done something foolish.
15074/0:I really don't enjoy this attention.
15074/1:Don't forget to blink.
15075/0:Time to send in a bot.
15076/0:I really don't enjoy this attention.
15076/1:Don't forget to blink.
15077/0:Time to send in a bot.
15078/0:I really don't enjoy this attention.
15078/1:Don't forget to blink.
15078/2:You want somthin?
15078/3:What are you starin' at?
15078/4:Quit eyeballin' me.
15079/0:Time to send in a bot.
15080/0:
15081/0:I really don't enjoy this attention.
15081/1:Don't forget to blink.
15081/2:Okay, that's enough.  Go watch someone else.
15081/3:I'm ignoring you...
15081/4:Wipe that look off your face.
15082/0:Time to send in a bot.
15083/0:Fantastic.  The nanformers will begin cleaning up the pollution in the medina right away.  The air should be safe within twenty-four hours.
15084/0:Oh Jesus!  What's happening?!
15085/0:You going to do it?
15086/0:Very interesting.  I'll be sure that this info gets passed along to my superiors and that the Templars are punished for this violation.  It's a serious offense.  And here's a reward for your fact-finding.
15087/0:Uh-huh.
15088/0:It was a pleasure doing business.
15089/0:I remember when I first heard about them -- the Order seemed all right.  Just a bunch of warm and fuzzy spiritual types.
15090/0:Got it.
15091/0:You got out alive.  That's all that matters.
15092/0:I really don't enjoy this attention.
15092/1:Don't forget to blink.
15093/0:I'll let a bot take care of this.
15094/0:I search every place that I can.  You're very close but not quite the one I'm looking for.
15095/0:I really don't enjoy this attention.
15095/1:Don't forget to blink.
15095/2:Do I have something on my face?
15095/3:Do you ever blink?
15095/4:Maybe you should rest your eyes.
15096/0:I'll let a bot take care of this.
15097/0:I already put down the money for Sid Black, the Harrier pilot.
15098/0:Maybe you should go rest.  You're acting a bit odd.
15098/1:Is this an act?  Or are you just out of your head?
15098/2:That is not allowed...
15098/3:I am not going to let you get away with that.
15098/4:I am going to be forced to report that.
15098/5:This is unacceptable!
15099/0:I'll let a bot take care of this.
15100/0:Maybe you should go rest.  You're acting a bit odd.
15100/1:Is this an act?  Or are you just out of your head?
15100/2:I must insist that you stop that.
15100/3:Ahem.  Are you ignoring me?
15100/4:Stop what you are doing immediately!
15101/0:I'll let a bot take care of this.
15102/0:Dr. Nassif will contact YOU.  Now leave at once.  You are too valuable to us to be risking your life in foolish expeditions.
15103/0:Maybe you should go rest.  You're acting a bit odd.
15103/1:Is this an act?  Or are you just out of your head?
15104/0:Hello there.  Alex, from the Tarsus Program, right?  Good work on the interrogation of Dr. Nassif in Cairo.  Teleportation, is it...?    ApostleCorp must have a line on some alien technology.
15105/0:Maybe you should go rest.  You're acting a bit odd.
15105/1:Is this an act?  Or are you just out of your head?
15106/0:Keep it movin'.
15106/1:Nothing to see here.
15106/2:Greetings.
15107/0:Is this an act, or are you just out of your head?
15107/1:You are not intimidating me, just aggravating me!
15108/0:Maybe you should go rest.  You're acting a bit odd.
15108/1:Is this an act?  Or are you just out of your head?
15109/0:Maybe you should go rest.  You're acting a bit odd.
15109/1:Is this an act?  Or are you just out of your head?
15110/0:Oh, I know quite well who the Minister is -- and how he likes to do business.  I've been trying to catch his eye.  Tell him I'll meet him at his penthouse in about an hour.
15111/0:Maybe you should go rest.  You're acting a bit odd.
15111/1:Is this an act?  Or are you just out of your head?
15112/0:We've got him now!
15112/1:He's not getting away.
15112/2:There! Close in!
15113/0:Tarsus is falling apart.  We need to get out before it comes crashing down on US.
15114/0:Oh...
15115/0:Don't be a nuisance.
15116/0:Let's rip.
15117/0:Fantastic.  Here's a few credits for your trouble.
15118/0:Let's pick another target.  I gotta keep moving to stay warm.
15119/0:(scream)
15120/0:Okay.  You can pass, but you're instructed to report immediately to Chief Morgan at the WTO air terminal.
15121/0:You better go.
15122/0:Maybe you should go rest.  You're acting a bit odd.
15122/1:Is this an act?  Or are you just out of your head?
15122/2:Hey!  Cut that out!
15122/3:Stop it -- now!
15122/4:Cool it!
15123/0:We shouldn't waste our time chatting.
15124/0:We've got her now!
15124/1:She's not getting away.
15124/2:We're closing in on her!
15125/0:Maybe you should go rest.  You're acting a bit odd.
15125/1:Is this an act?  Or are you just out of your head?
15125/2:They aren't going to like this...
15125/3:I had a friend who did that once... Once.
15125/4:He-llo?!  Are you listening to me?
15126/0:After the Collapse, we just lost track of so many facilities like this.  And new ones sprang up in the aftermath, unlicensed and unregulated.
15127/0:That bot looks strange.....RUN!!!
15127/1:Look out!  Something's wrong with it!
15128/0:Maybe you should go rest.  You're acting a bit odd.
15128/1:Is this an act?  Or are you just out of your head?
15129/0:Gotta show this thing who's boss.
15130/0:Alex -- no second thoughts, and no violence.  I'll protect Dr. Nassif myself if I have to.
15131/0:
15132/0:Maybe you should go rest.  You're acting a bit odd.
15132/1:Is this an act?  Or are you just out of your head?
15132/2:Stop already.
15132/3:Ahem.  Do I need to go find a security guard?
15132/4:Please stop that!
15133/0:Gotta show this thing who's boss.
15134/0:You're not intimidating me, just aggravating me.
15134/1:I think you should reconsider that course of action.
15135/0:Gotta show this thing who's boss.
15136/0:I'm not supposed to talk to the buyers, so don't repeat anything I just said.
15137/0:You're not intimidating me, just aggravating me.
15137/1:I think you should reconsider that course of action.
15138/0:Gotta show this thing who's boss.
15139/0:You're not intimidating me, just aggravating me.
15139/1:I think you should reconsider that course of action.
15140/0:(grunt) Oh God, I'm hit!
15141/0:I had a bar in Lower Seattle before the WTO created this high-class enclave.  The crimelords down there were pussycats compared to what I have to deal with here.
15142/0:You're not intimidating me, just aggravating me.
15142/1:I think you should reconsider that course of action.
15143/0:(grunt) Oh God, I'm hit!
15144/0:(laugh)  Won't be keeping me up at night.  Here's your money.
15145/0:I've learned some things about the experiments they were doing on us.
15146/0:I think you should reconsider that course of action!
15146/1:I am not here for target practice!
15147/0:(grunt) Oh God, I'm hit!
15148/0:A Templar would just as soon lynch a merc like you or me, cuz of our biomods.  If there's a problem, I plan to fight.
15149/0:You're not intimidating me, just aggravating me.
15149/1:I think you should reconsider that course of action.
15150/0:(grunt) Oh God, I'm hit!
15151/0:
15152/0:Are you... Her Holiness?  It's strange seeing you as just another person...
15153/0:No skin off MY nose, though.  They still have to kiss my boots, and I plan to make them do it, too.
15154/0:
15155/0:I am not in the mood for your shenanigans.
15155/1:Go put on your bizarre little show for someone else.
15156/0:At last...  Do not betray us, Denton.
15157/0:I am not in the mood for your shenanigans.
15157/1:Go put on your bizarre little show for someone else.
15157/2:You trying to start something?
15157/3:What are you trying to prove?
15158/0:Yeah, tell it to the Chief.
15159/0:I am not in the mood for your shenanigans.
15159/1:Go put on your bizarre little show for someone else.
15159/2:I'm watching you.
15159/3:That is not permitted.
15159/4:I'm warning you -- no more of that.
15160/0:Thank you for undoing some of the Hateful Ones' damage.
15161/0:We plan to give people a sense of freedom and a prosperous world.  In practical, historical terms, that's about as good as it gets.
15162/0:I say!  Knock it off!
15162/1:I strongly recommend taking back your silly threat.
15163/0:By now you will have been told that you are the third Denton prototype.  That isn't quite true, or I wouldn't have been willing to destroy an entire city to kill you.
15164/0:I say!  Knock it off!
15164/1:I strongly recommend taking back your silly threat.
15165/0:I say!  Knock it off!
15165/1:I strongly recommend taking back your silly threat.
15166/0:You don't wear it.  It replaces your frontal lobes.
15167/0:This area is restricted!  Get out of here!
15167/1:You lack the proper clearance!  Move along!
15168/0:I've got work to do.
15169/0:This area is restricted!  Get out of here!
15169/1:You lack the proper clearance!  Move along!
15170/0:This area is restricted!  Get out of here!
15170/1:You lack the proper clearance!  Move along!
15171/0:The WTO handpicks cities for incorporation and citizens for membership.  These enclave citizens then choose the best suited among their number to lead them.  Such a system is immune from corruption.  My fellow Cairo citizens, you are my conscience -- I have always acted as you have demanded.
15172/0:Wiseass.  You're going to pay for this if you don't knock it off.
15172/1:You're going to regret this if you don't just move along right now.
15173/0:In a short time, the SSC will be put to the test on the international stage.  Tension in Trier right now is building, as members of both organizations flow into a city already exhausted by conflict.
15174/0:That's why I joined up.  In case there's a way to turn things around.
15175/0:I'll keep that in mind.
15176/0:Now I'm a big joke.  People say I lost everything cuz I was drunk.
15177/0:
15178/0:Uh... Hey.  How's it goin'?
15179/0:You're not intimidating me, just aggravating me.
15179/1:I think you should reconsider that course of action.
15180/0:(grunt) That got my attention.
15181/0:You're not intimidating me, just aggravating me.
15181/1:I think you should reconsider that course of action.
15182/0:(grunt) That got my attention.
15183/0:You're not intimidating me, just aggravating me.
15183/1:I think you should reconsider that course of action.
15184/0:(grunt) That got my attention.
15185/0:I did what I had to.
15186/0:Shed your worldly connections.  Develop your Furqan.  It enables you to distinguish between true and false, bewteen real and fiction, between Order and chaos.  Deep in your hearts, you know the path you seek.  You must relearn to access it by turning your back on this materialistic society.
15187/0:You're not intimidating me, just aggravating me.
15187/1:I think you should reconsider that course of action.
15188/0:(grunt) That got my attention.
15189/0:You're not intimidating me, just aggravating me.
15189/1:I think you should reconsider that course of action.
15190/0:(groan) I don't think I'll last much longer.
15191/0:You're not intimidating me, just aggravating me.
15191/1:I think you should reconsider that course of action.
15192/0:(groan) I don't think I'll last much longer.
15193/0:I thought I was clear.  This is a restricted area.
15193/1:Move along already.
15194/0:(groan) I don't think I'll last much longer.
15195/0:I thought I was clear.  This is a restricted area.
15195/1:Move along already.
15196/0:(groan) I don't think I'll last much longer.
15197/0:I thought I was clear.  This is a restricted area.
15197/1:Move along already.
15198/0:It burns!
15199/0:
15200/0:I thought I was clear.  This is a restricted area.
15200/1:Move along already.
15201/0:It burns!
15202/0:Everything will return to normal soon.  I'm sure of it.
15203/0:Wiseass.  You're going to pay for this if you don't knock it off.
15203/1:You're going to regret this if you don't just move along right now.
15204/0:I'm starting to believe some of that stuff myself, actually.  It's just saturation.  Finally your brain just gives up.
15205/0:Wiseass.  You're going to pay for this if you don't knock it off.
15205/1:You're going to regret this if you don't just move along right now.
15206/0:Well, here's your chance to test his resolve.
15207/0:So de Tocqueville noted that an all-knowing mind -- the mind of God, as he conceived it -- would have no need for general ideas.  It would understand every individual in detail and at a glance.  Incomplete applications of law or justice would be impossible for such a mind.
15208/0:
15209/0:That's it!  I've had it!
15209/1:I warned you that this would happen...
15210/0:They are filled with hatred.... here to destroy JC and our clan.
15211/0:That's it!  I've had it!
15211/1:I warned you that this would happen...
15212/0:I'm just glad I didn't have a reaction to whatever the Tarsus people were shooting into our veins, and now I've got a security assignment.  That's all I ever wanted from that place.
15213/0:That's it!  I've had it!
15213/1:I warned you that this would happen...
15214/0:Irredeemable.  You are absolutely irredeemable.  Prepare yourself for the grave.
15215/0:Horde RCP.  When you need a little extra punch.
15216/0:Gah!  I hope you're finished.  //sarcastic
15216/1:I assume you're going to start acting like a civilized human being now...
15217/0:Gah!  I hope you're finished.  //sarcastic
15217/1:I assume you're going to start acting like a civilized human being now...
15218/0:Gah!  I hope you're finished.  //sarcastic
15218/1:I assume you're going to start acting like a civilized human being now...
15219/0:The WTO's security procedures are spelled out in the Charter, in case you have any questions.  Use of incorporated zones is entirely voluntary.
15220/0:Paladins!  Engage!
15220/1:Caution be damned!  My life for a gram of Purity!
15220/2:Together, friends, together we strike!
15221/0:I've done all I can do.
15222/0:Paladins!  Here!
15222/1:Have courage, paladins!  On to Good Works...
15222/2:To the death!  Duty commands us...
15223/0:I thought I was clear.  This is a restricted area.
15223/1:Move along -- now.
15224/0:It burns!
15225/0:It's definitely a secret base of some kind.  Guys in uniform moving in weird machines in the middle of the night.  If you want to get in and check it out, I can tell you where all of the guards are.  
15226/0:I thought I was clear.  This is a restricted area.
15226/1:Move along already.
15227/0:It burns!
15228/0:I'll keep a lock on the beacon.  Use it to contact me when you're ready.
15229/0:I thought I was clear.  This is a restricted area.
15229/1:Move along already.
15230/0:(moan) Was that... poison?!
15231/0:They're just excited about the show the SSC just put on, dragging Headmaster Archer out of here.  Me?  I've got better concentration and focus.
15232/0:This is a Special Report from World News.  Coming on the heels of the Chicago disaster, the city of Seattle has been hit by a series of terrorist attacks.
15233/0:I thought I was clear.  This is a restricted area.
15233/1:Move along already.
15234/0:(moan) Was that... poison?!
15235/0:I thought I was clear.  This is a restricted area.
15235/1:Move along already.
15236/0:(moan) Was that... poison?!
15237/0:I've got a Fragmentary Round weapon mod -- snap this on and your shot will explode on impact.  I've also got two ammo clips -- always useful.  Finally I've got three EMP grenades to use on those pesky bots and such.
15238/0:I thought I was clear.  This is a restricted area.
15238/1:Move along already.
15239/0:(moan) Was that... poison?!
15240/0:I don't believe it... my best fighter...  killed by a spoon-fed rookie.
15241/0:I thought I was clear.  This is a restricted area.
15241/1:Move along already.
15242/0:I can't see!
15243/0:I thought I was clear.  This is a restricted area.
15243/1:Move along already.
15244/0:I can't see!
15245/0:I've just about hit my limit.
15245/1:I only have so much patience.
15246/0:I can't see!
15247/0:Some people are still afraid to come out.  But I don't need fancy sensors to tell me that the air's clean.
15248/0:I've just about hit my limit.
15248/1:I only have so much patience.
15249/0:I can't see!
15250/0:Our brethren made it to safety.
15251/0:There is but one caged, but we are all together.
15252/0:
15253/0:What's your rate?
15254/0:Paladins!  Here!
15254/1:Courage, paladins!  On to Good Works...
15254/2:To the death!  Duty commands us...
15255/0:I'm sending for reinforcements.
15255/1:I've got to find us some help.
15256/0:I'm sending for reinforcements.
15256/1:I've got to find us some help.
15257/0:Personally, I'm not going to waste my time saving the planet until we find out where Dr. Nassif is hiding.
15258/0:I'm sending for reinforcements.
15258/1:I've got to find us some help.
15259/0:Not life-threatening.  Paul is no weaker than any man cured of a serious disease.  With your continued help, we will build a synthetic immune system for all of us.
15260/0:I'm out of here!
15260/1:I can't take any more!
15261/0:I'm out of here!
15261/1:I can't take any more!
15261/2:Not worth it...
15261/3:I could've been killed!
15261/4:Help!
15262/0:Want my opinion?
15263/0:We want to give people more choices and more opportunities to live better lives.  Surely you want to aid us with such an endeavor.
15264/0:Those are pretty big words for a rookie.  Go ahead.  You first.  I'll bring up the rear.
15265/0:I'm out of here!
15265/1:I can't take any more!
15265/2:Gotta find the rendezvous.
15265/3:Where's the backup?
15265/4:Gotta clear out.
15266/0:I cannot watch over you anymore because I am needed elsewhere.  Here is a map of the island.  I hope that when the time comes you will choose to join us, Alex.
15267/0:Here's a gift.  Hope you like it.
15267/1:Ka...BOOM!
15268/0:Here's a gift.  Hope you like it.
15268/1:Ka...BOOM!
15269/0:No?  Then what?  Do you know who is after my family?
15270/0:Here's a gift.  Hope you like it.
15270/1:Ka...BOOM!
15271/0:I've never met the Dentons, but the story is that they realized after the Collapse that no attempt to restore any form of world government was going to succeed right away.  They decided instead to prepare the conditions for a new type of government.
15272/0:I'm always on, 24-7.  Whenever you need me.
15273/0:They're going to regret treating me like they have here.
15274/0:Paid for by the Order Church.  See the church in your area for details.
15275/0:These kids study some pretty crazy stuff.  My school certainly wasn't this demanding.
15276/0:I escaped.  You may be interested to know that I found another person who appears to be modified in the way that you were.  Leo Jankowski.  I gave him a ride to Cairo.
15277/0:I've just about hit my limit.
15277/1:I only have so much patience.
15278/0:Is that all you've got?
15279/0:I don't know how I feel about that....  Where's the honor in fighting a battle from a control pod two thousand miles away?
15280/0:I've just about hit my limit.
15280/1:I only have so much patience.
15281/0:Is that all you've got?
15282/0:Ready to fly?
15283/0:I only have so much patience.
15283/1:You are about to cross the line!
15284/0:Is that all you've got?
15285/0:I've just about hit my limit.
15285/1:I only have so much patience.
15286/0:Is that all you've got?
15287/0:I'm just looking for some answers.  Tell me about the Mag Rail project and what it has to do with ApostleCorp.
15288/0:I've just about hit my limit.
15288/1:I only have so much patience.
15289/0:Nooo....
15289/1:It's over...
15290/0:Piezochem.... Medkits.  Respirators.  Bots for recovery and medical assistence.  Providing necessary products as we stand beside you in a difficult time.
15291/0:
15292/0:I've just about hit my limit.
15292/1:I only have so much patience.
15293/0:Nooo....
15293/1:It's over...
15294/0:A lot of people look down their noses at home-bred gobs, but it's the training that counts, in my opinion.
15295/0:When this is all over, they'll call us heroes and saints.
15296/0:I've just about hit my limit.
15296/1:I only have so much patience.
15297/0:Nooo....
15297/1:It's over...
15298/0:
15298/1:
15298/2:
15298/3:
15298/4:
15298/5:
15299/0:I've just about hit my limit.
15299/1:I only have so much patience.
15300/0:Nooo....
15300/1:It's over...
15301/0:What can you tell me about the VIP area?
15302/0:I've just about hit my limit.
15302/1:I only have so much patience.
15303/0:(moan)
15303/1:(groan)
15303/2:(grunt)
15304/0:I've just about hit my limit.
15304/1:I only have so much patience.
15305/0:(moan)
15305/1:(groan)
15305/2:(grunt)
15306/0:I'm glad you finally came to your senses.
15307/0:Yeah, you're right.  This getup looks like a frogsuit.  Either I take up scuba diving, or I find an implant surgeon who can remove it.
15308/0:Maybe another time.
15309/0:Grenade!
15309/1:Mine!
15310/0:My jet's already on the roof and primed for takoff.  See?  You can always count on Sid Black for a timely extraction.
15311/0:You really should get a map.  It's easy to get lost around here.
15312/0:Grenade!
15312/1:Mine!
15313/0:Grenade!
15313/1:Mine!
15314/0:Unfortunately, yes.  He has taken the Order's respect for Nature and warped it into fanaticism.  His quest for "Purity" is just a euphemism for the extermination of modified individuals.
15315/0:The payment first, please.
15316/0:I'm going to need a repair bot to defuse this thing.
15316/1:Nice.  I wonder who's responsible.
15317/0:Someone oughtta cook Gob-zilla in her cage.  Give someone else a chance to make a living at this racket.
15318/0:I'm going to need a repair bot to defuse this thing.
15318/1:Nice.  I wonder who's responsible.
15319/0:I'm going to need a repair bot to defuse this thing.
15319/1:Nice.  I wonder who's responsible.
15320/0:I'm after someone who attacked me.  Did anyone come through here?  
15320/1:I was in a fight, then the thug ran off.  Have you seen anyone?
15321/0:I'm after someone who attacked me.  Did anyone come through here?  
15321/1:I was in a fight, then the thug ran off.  Have you seen anyone?
15322/0:I could tell you, but what a waste that would be of your data processing ability.
15323/0:Oh, Ani!  You're right -- it's a beautiful day!
15324/0:I'm after someone who attacked me.  Did anyone come through here?  
15324/1:I was in a fight, then the thug ran off.  Have you seen anyone?
15325/0:I can't wait to see the first NG advertisement.
15326/0:No problem.
15327/0:I was just about the finish him off when he fled.  Have you seen him?
15328/0:Dr. Manus, we recognize that someone of your stature at Mako Ballistics is involved in several top ranking development projects.  We also know that we've given you millions of credits for this exclusive contract, so we feel are within rights to demand that you meet your deadlines and provide another demonstration as soon as possible.
15329/0:
15330/0:Archer has to be stopped.  But we are just kids.
15331/0:Good.  Now get inside the main complex.  If it was me, I'd try to get past the guards and automated security without being seen, but if you've got to fight remember that bots and other electronics are most vulnerable to EMP attacks.
15332/0:I'm ready.
15333/0:(moan)
15333/1:(groan)
15333/2:(grunt)
15334/0:Never fear.  Miss Denton has nothing more to accomplish here.  The data is safe, and our forces should be on the move.  Be proud, paladins, we're about to make history!
15335/0:(moan)
15335/1:(groan)
15335/2:(grunt)
15336/0:Oh -- is that a biomod canister?  Thanks.
15337/0:Oomph.
15337/1:(grunt)
15338/0:What IS this place anyway?
15339/0:Oomph.
15339/1:(grunt)
15340/0:Oomph.
15340/1:(grunt)
15341/0:Oomph.
15341/1:(grunt)
15342/0:Need a straight answer -- about anything -- I'll be standing right here.
15343/0:(gasp)
15344/0:(gasp)
15345/0:Go outside to the abandoned VersaLife base.  I see that you have already turned on the pilot beacon.  I will be able to meet you there.
15346/0:(gasp)
15347/0:(gasp)
15348/0:You did not betray, like the other.
15349/0:A good kid.  Kind of a chip on his shoulder, though.  What about you?  Your eyes look a little bloodshot.  Been out in the dust?  You should've hired a better flyer.  Someone like me coulda dropped you in the city.
15350/0:Just let me in.
15351/0:I don't think so.
15352/0:
15352/1:
15353/0:I was just about the finish him off when he fled.  Have you seen him?
15354/0:I'm responsible for the plant, you know.  I don't want things getting screwed up.
15355/0:I was just about the finish him off when he fled.  Have you seen him?
15356/0:I was just about to finish her off when she fled.  Have you seen her?
15357/0:I was just about to finish her off when she fled.  Have you seen her?
15358/0:From here out, it's just cleanin' up.
15359/0:I was just about to finish her off when she fled.  Have you seen her?
15360/0:Just trying to sleep off the chopper ride.  What happened?  The guards practically dragged me to the roof.
15361/0:I was attacked!  Have you seen anything?
15362/0:I was attacked!  Have you seen anything?
15363/0:I was attacked!  Have you seen anything?
15364/0:I'm following a trespasser.  Have you seen anyone?
15364/1:I'm in pursuit of a thug -- did you see anyone come by?
15365/0:I'm following a trespasser.  Have you seen anyone?
15365/1:I'm in pursuit of a thug -- did you see anyone come by?
15366/0:
15366/1:
15366/2:
15367/0:I have work to do in Cairo.
15368/0:Someone inside the Tarsus program broke ranks.  By now at least a half-dozen groups are on our tail.
15369/0:It is not yet clear whether the substances being transported were mislabeled, prohibited, or simply mishandled by the Inclinator crew.
15370/0:Right now we're expanding production, so we're looking for new faces.  You might be the next Vice-manager in charge of servo-receptors or Armor Arc-Welder Technician 3.  Submit your application today.
15371/0:You will appreciate our merchandise.  You may purchase now or earn a discount by providing a service to the Omar.
15372/0:Poor beasts...
15373/0:I supplied him with weapons when he was a so-called freedom-fighter against MJ-12 in France.  Then he came to power and began persecuting independent scientists and businesses.
15374/0:I haven't seen this craft before. Welcome to our small medina.
15375/0:You're probably here for the fights.  Well, that spit-contest ain't fightin'.
15376/0:
15377/0:I'm following a trespasser.  Have you seen anyone?
15377/1:I'm in pursuit of a thug -- did you see anyone come by?
15378/0:I'm following a trail.  Notice anything around here?
15379/0:Hi!  This is Klara... Sorry -- I'm not in my quarters right now.  I'm probably on the lower level for training.  But thanks for stopping by!
15380/0:I'm following a trail.  Notice anything around here?
15381/0:I'm following a trail.  Notice anything around here?
15382/0:Any ideas what's happening?
15382/1:What do you think this is all about?
15382/2:Do you know what's going on?
15383/0:Any ideas what's happening?
15383/1:What do you think this is all about?
15383/2:Do you know what's going on?
15384/0:Any ideas what's happening?
15384/1:What do you think this is all about?
15384/2:Do you know what's going on?
15385/0:Probably some sort of office politics, someone trying to get back at somebody else.
15386/0:And the Omar are grateful to you for your help in avoiding the Templar raid in Cairo.
15387/0:Don't disappoint us like your classmate, Miss Sparks.  This was her mission, but she wouldn't follow through.  My captain on the ground took her into custody and will handle the transport out of the arcology.  Pay attention, Alex.  I'm through sweet-talking you trainees.  Do as we say or your traitorous friend dies.
15388/0:To hell with an economic shock.  People want the new cities, and they want them now.
15389/0:Has High Augur Chen met your new friend?
15390/0:Yeah?  If it was me, I'd sneak up on the place and eavesdrop.  Omar schematics show a vent near the Tarsus school on 107 -- west wall.  One of the shafts leads to the kiosk.  You could listen from inside the shaft.  Be careful, though.  Arcology support systems are secured against pests -- whether transgenic or human.

15391/7:
15392/0:Bolt caster?  An interesting choice...
15393/0:Bolt caster?  An interesting choice...
15394/0:Well, Her Holiness is a woman who --
15395/0:What's an Omar doing in the heart of Upper Seattle?
15396/0:Bolt caster?  An interesting choice...
15397/0:It looks like there's a knife-thrower about.
15398/0:The door's open...?  Any idea what's up?
15399/0:It looks like there's a knife-thrower about.
15400/0:You have to be careful of your loyalties in the post-Collapse world.  That is the secret to success.
15401/0:She and Mr. Dumier knew that it would be too hard to pull together a global government from the chaos of the Collapse.  They chose to reinvent specific aspects of power and then bring them together later into one body.
15402/0:The door's open...?  Any idea what's up?
15403/0:It looks like there's a knife-thrower about.
15404/0:The door's open...?  Any idea what's up?
15405/0:It's just a trick!
15405/1:Oh, I see your game now...
15406/0:The door's closed...?  Any idea what's up?
15407/0:It's just a trick!
15407/1:Oh, I see your game now...
15408/0:The door's closed...?  Any idea what's up?
15409/0:It's just a trick!
15409/1:Oh, I see your game now...
15410/0:The door's closed...?  Any idea what's up?
15411/0:Hey, ignore that -- it's just a trick.  
15412/0:Did you see who turned on the light?
15413/0:You want me to kill someone's greasel?
15414/0:Did you see who turned on the light?
15415/0:Did you see who turned on the light?
15416/0:Did you see who shut off the light?
15417/0:If the Templars' twisted ideas are permitted to spread, they will lead only to great suffering.
15418/0:The lockdown's still in effect, so watch your step.
15419/0:You're not supposed to be back here!
15420/0:Everything is arranged.  Pretty soon screaming kids will be lined up around the block.
15421/0:You look fine to ME.
15422/0:Part of it, maybe.  The Templars have cells all over the medina.  The key will be knowing in advance when the strike is going to happen.
15423/0:
15424/0:It just boggles the mind, how fast the playing field can change.
15425/0:So Eeva WAS right.  
15426/0:It just boggles the mind, how fast the playing field can change.
15427/0:These guys are mercenaries.  They pitch whatever creed their boss tells them to.
15428/0:With or without one of us, you mean.  I'm a Knight Templar now.  May Purity prevail!
15429/0:We only want to be left in peace.  We come to help JC to make this the last conflict.
15430/0:I keep telling my little girl -- the security force here will keep us safe no matter what happens in other places.
15431/0:Hey, ignore that -- it's just a trick.  
15432/0:Ever think about a job in Inclinator Maintenance?  It's a growing field.
15433/0:How's the search coming?
15434/0:Hey, ignore that -- it's just a trick.  
15435/0:Chief Engineer.  How'd you get down here?
15436/0:I KNEW that didn't sound right.  It's just a trick.
15437/0:In effect, Paul and JC helped make you everything you are today.  It's time to repay that debt.
15438/0:I KNEW that didn't sound right.  It's just a trick.
15439/0:You're Tracer Tong.
15440/0:Did you see who shut off the light?
15441/0:I KNEW that didn't sound right.  It's just a trick.
15442/0:For the time being, at least...  I'm going to stay hidden until I'm sure it's safe out there, and just hope he doesn't find us.
15443/0:Normally I would have you killed on the spot, but you are still my best asset against Saman.  I am going to give you the map I promised.  Hopefully, in time, you will change your opinion of my cause.
15444/0:Did you see who shut off the light?
15445/0: We've been had!  It's just a noisemaker.
15446/0:Any ideas what spooked the critters?
15447/0:We've been had!  It's just a noisemaker.
15448/0:Stop hanging around -- time for action.
15449/0:Any ideas what spooked the critters?
15450/0: We've been had!  It's just a noisemaker.
15451/0:Any ideas what spooked the critters?
15452/0:I knew it -- just a smoke trick.
15453/0:Any ideas what startled these birds?
15454/0:I knew it -- just a smoke trick.
15455/0:Any ideas what startled these birds?
15456/0:Any ideas what startled these birds?
15457/0:Do you know what riled up this rat?
15458/0:Pretty soon everything will be man-made, the trees, the rice and corn, livestock, maybe even people.
15459/0:Do you know what riled up this rat?
15460/0:Here's something to give you an edge -- a biomod infusion.  It isn't much, but it's all I managed to grab on my way out of the laboratory.
15461/0:Maybe later.
15462/0:I bet it IS a drill.  Some kind of test...
15463/0:Don't worry -- if they trace this thing to you I'll play like I never met you.
15464/0:What's wrong?
15465/0:
15465/1:
15465/2:
15465/3:
15466/0:Sure, take out the Templars.  [250]
15467/0:Dr. Nassif.  She will try to recapture you.
15468/0:I have some unfinished business to take care of.
15469/0:
15470/0:I knew it -- just a smoke trick.
15471/0:Don't worry -- it's just a smokescreen.
15472/0:Don't worry -- it's just a smokescreen.
15473/0:Don't worry -- it's just a smokescreen.
15474/0:The train station's around the bend.  Just follow the upper sidewalk.
15475/0:Do you know what riled up this rat?
15476/0:How did that happen?
15476/1:Hmm... Clumsy...?
15477/0:Do you know what the deal is with this cat?
15478/0:How did that happen?
15478/1:Hmm... Clumsy...?
15479/0:Unlike my enemies, I've read the classics of political theory.  I know the difference between leadership and ambition.
15480/0:
15481/0:Do you know what the deal is with this cat?
15482/0:How did that happen?
15482/1:Hmm... Clumsy...?
15483/0:I already cooked that gob.
15484/0:Do you know what the deal is with this cat?
15485/0:By the skull of Sidon, it's missing!
15485/1:It's gone...
15486/0:Any clue why this is on?
15487/0:By the skull of Sidon, it's missing!
15487/1:It's gone...
15488/0:Any clue why this is on?
15489/0:By the skull of Sidon, it's missing!
15489/1:It's gone...
15490/0:Any clue why this is on?
15491/0:I like her music.  It's got attitude, unlike like most of the stuff you hear nowadays.
15492/0:Any idea why this is off?
15493/0:
15494/0:Any idea why this is off?
15495/0:Any idea why this is off?
15496/0:Let's just say I have a few tricks up my sleeve -- kinda like you do.
15497/0:I'm not sightseeing.  I have business here.
15498/0:Gimme what you got.
15499/0:Miss Adams, I understand your grief and frustration.  The building is two-way secure for your safety as well as Tarsus's.  This will be temporary if everyone cooperates.  Incidentally, stay out of my office when I'm not here.  I respect your privacy; you should respect mine.  Please give up your search for an exit.
15500/0:Hey, yo, we don't need no feebs tryin' to sabotage the fight.
15501/0:SSC is not permitted to comment at this time.
15502/0:How did that get here?
15502/1:That's not where it should be.
15503/0:To prevent us from overpowering our masters by sheer numbers, we were created unable to reproduce.  That is why the Templar threat to us is so dire -- we are all that remains.
15504/0:How did that get here?
15504/1:That's not where it should be.
15505/0:I just suddenly woke up.  I was installing this range weapon-mod on my rifle, and it clicked -- I've been training my whole life to hunt and kill people.  Even ApostleCorp -- that's what they trained me to do.
15506/0:How did that get here?
15506/1:That's not where it should be.
15507/0:Great news.  Thanks.
15508/0:Gah!  Someone's damaged it.
15508/1:I wonder who's responsible for this damage.  I doubt it was one of ours...
15509/0:
15510/0:What's going on?  This is supposed to be closed.
15511/0:Gah!  Someone's damaged it.
15511/1:I wonder who's responsible for this damage.  I doubt it was one of ours...
15512/0:What's going on?  This is supposed to be closed.
15513/0:Gah!  Someone's damaged it.
15513/1:I wonder who's responsible for this damage.  I doubt it was one of ours...
15514/0:What's going on?  This is supposed to be closed.
15515/0:It's been destroyed.
15515/1:Whoever wrecked this is going to pay for it.
15516/0:What's going on?  This is supposed to be open.
15517/0:It's been destroyed.
15517/1:Whoever wrecked this is going to pay for it.
15518/0:I bet it IS a drill.  Some kind of test...
15519/0:What's going on?  This is supposed to be open.
15520/0:It's been destroyed.
15520/1:Whoever wrecked this is going to pay for it.
15521/0:What's going on?  This is supposed to be open.
15522/0:Shut down?  That seems suspicious...
15522/1:I don't think that should be powered down right now.
15523/0:Any ideas how this got wrecked?
15524/0:Yes... well... your father was just being a comedian...
15525/0:
15526/0:Any ideas how this got wrecked?
15527/0:A wise shopper.
15528/0:Any ideas how this got wrecked?
15529/0:I'm positive that the missing students will be found.
15530/0:Any last-minute advice?
15531/0:Any ideas how this got damaged?
15532/0:Funny way to run an operation.  Wonder who'd hide out in a dumpster.
15533/0:
15534/0:Perhaps.  I will find out when I get to Trier.
15535/0:He's already out to get me because I killed his brother.
15536/0:I provide defense, should the need arise.  Traders handle the business.
15537/0:The work on hydraulic locomotive amplification has been stimulating -- don't get me wrong -- but I don't know how much longer I can bear to see my work auctioned to the highest bidder.
15538/0:Why not?  I'm not planning to spend the rest of my life in this place.
15539/0:Ready yet?
15540/0:Is there another way out?
15541/0:What's the connection to Mako?
15542/0:You get to do the honors.
15543/0:Hang on -- There's a Templar military bot on patrol near this sector.  You may want to rethink travel in this area.  
15544/0:Shut down?  That seems suspicious...
15544/1:I don't think that should be powered down right now.
15545/0:Shut down?  That seems suspicious...
15545/1:I don't think that should be powered down right now.
15546/0:Sorry, Chicago, I'm gonna have to take you out.
15547/0:Gah!  It's gone haywire.
15547/1:I don't think it's supposed to do THAT.
15548/0:Scan complete.  You biomods are quite new, but we offer technology you cannot find in Piezochem's labs.
15549/0:Gah!  It's gone haywire.
15549/1:I don't think it's supposed to do THAT.
15550/0:Tarsus Tracking Report 4117 -- Alex D.  There are concerns that D. may be the greatest threat among his peers.  Last seen in Cairo, questioning Leila Nassif for the WTO.  Intel suggests that he now has objectives in Trier.  This makes it imperative that we get our agent through the gate immediately and shut it down.
15551/0:Gah!  It's gone haywire.
15551/1:I don't think it's supposed to do THAT.
15552/0:I wonder why this is on...
15552/1:That's supposed to be off.
15553/0:I wonder why this is on...
15553/1:That's supposed to be off.
15554/0:What do you mean?
15555/0:I wonder why this is on...
15555/1:That's supposed to be off.
15556/0:This is supposed to be on.
15556/1:I wonder why this is off...
15557/0:And the Omar are grateful to you for your help in avoiding the Templar raid in Cairo.
15558/0:This is supposed to be on.
15558/1:I wonder why this is off...
15559/0:For now, we must work quietly and thanklessly.
15560/0:This city is lost.  Toxic air and fanatics enforcing martial law.
15561/0:I talked to a dweeb in pajamas and laughed my ass off as I walked away.
15562/0:We still need a lead on Nassif, or we won't know where to send you next.  Double-check the biolab for clues.
15563/0:Ah, you seek solace from your everyday troubles.
15564/0:When I said to get a pilot, I didn't mean steal one from the WTO!  You've put me in a bind, Alex.  It's critical that I try to recruit you to our cause, but to be honest I would like nothing more right now than for one of my troopers to put a bullet in the back of your head.
15565/0:You had better take another look at the main chamber.  You were just teleported almost a half a mile.  I'm not surprised, though.  I was able to construct the Black Gate teleporter only with instructions from Helios.
15566/0:This is supposed to be on.
15566/1:I wonder why this is off...
15567/0:I'll let you know.
15568/0:Hi.  I'm NG Resonance.  What would you like to chat about?
15569/0:I wonder why this is open.
15569/1:I'm sure that's supposed to stay closed.
15570/0:I wonder why this is open.
15570/1:I'm sure that's supposed to stay closed.
15571/0:You're starting to seem more like a surveillance tool than a pop-star.
15572/0:I wonder why this is open.
15572/1:I'm sure that's supposed to stay closed.
15573/0:I wonder why this is closed.
15573/1:I'm sure that's supposed to stay open.
15574/0:I wonder why this is closed.
15574/1:I'm sure that's supposed to stay open.
15575/0:
15576/0:I wonder why this is closed.
15576/1:I'm sure that's supposed to stay open.
15577/0:He sent me a childish drawing of a dolphin, and now he thinks he owns dolphins.  The fact is that I had ten dolphin proposals for the Galleria sculpture alone, and his was the worst.
15578/0:Very well.  Forget the briefing.  We've had our suspicions about the Templar activity around the Black Gate.  If it's true that they're the ones holding Her Holiness, I want you to find her and make sure she is safe.
15579/0:I just came by to talk to Chief Morgan.
15580/0:What rumors?
15581/0:She's as much Denton as you, thanks to the ApostleCorp infusions.  I sent her through the teleporter to locate and kill JC.
15582/0:I should get back to work.
15583/0:So what do you think really happened?
15584/0:Yeah?
15585/0:The Age of Light is at hand.
15586/0:There has been a sudden and unseasonable temperature drop which has not as of yet stabilized.  The cause is yet unknown.
15587/0:You must mean Billie and the Templars.  I guess she's already passed through this way.  Did she take any Templars with her?
15588/0:Whatever you say.
15589/0:
15590/0:I'm glad that the new fellow is working out.  I've been hoping my little Gina will get accepted next year.
15591/0:Careful walkin' around here at night.
15592/0:My lawyer knows how to prosecute pushy fangirls.
15593/0:I wonder what's taking security so long...?
15594/0:I told you we'd make quick work of this.
15594/1:Soon, victory will be ours.
15595/0:The tide will turn.
15595/1:Baphomet, give me strength.
15596/0:The tide will turn.
15596/1:Baphomet, give me strength.
15597/0:Argh.  It appears we may be evenly matched.
15597/1:Looks like this is going to take all we've got.
15598/0:It's false advertising if the product doesn't exist, right?  I would like to know why the authorities are ignoring this situation.
15599/0:Argh.  It appears we may be evenly matched.
15599/1:Looks like this is going to take all we've got.
15600/0:I'm doomed...
15600/1:How is this possible? Purity cannot be defeated...
15601/0:Vera Maxwell -- Executive Commander for the SSC.
15602/0:I'm doomed...
15602/1:How is this possible? Purity cannot be defeated...
15603/0:It doesn't look good for us...
15603/1:Baphomet, do not forsake us...
15604/0:It doesn't look good for us...
15604/1:Baphomet, do not forsake us...
15605/0:Go to hell.
15606/0:I have two black-market biomod canisters which enable non-Piezochem functionality.  Also:  three concussion prox mines, which you can plant on any flat surface to be detonated by movement within close range.  As a preferred customer, you may purchase items at half-price.
15607/0:No, you've just got to consent to the standard deactivation procedure before entry: I'll transmit the encrypted safety-lock bytecode which will effectively freeze all your weapons.  Sensors at the exit will automatically reactivate everything you're carrying when you leave.
15608/0:What a terrible world to bring a child into.
15609/0:SMALL-TIME?  I'm Sophia Sak!  I'll show you small-time... small time to LIVE.
15610/0:Maybe you should ask her for an endorsement.
15611/0:Excellent negotiations.
15612/0:Okay, I'm Eeva.  And people SHOULD be worried.  We were poking around the Headmaster's office one day, and found this secret room.  From the looks of it, he's plotting something horrible for some of the students here.
15613/0:It was an accident.  Weapon malfunction.
15614/0:
15615/0:All I need you to do is upload the Aquinas specification from the MJ-12 lab underneath UNATCO.  Our scientists will take it from there.
15616/0:We were given a chance to protect the world's leaders -- and failed.  SSC will never recover.
15617/0:Sure, tell me about the guards.
15618/0:Trier residents will be getting a new cup-o-Joe next month.  Pequod's has announced plans to open a branch in the downtown district.  The manager of the local Queequeg's has been curiously silent on the issue.
15619/0:
15620/0:I paid sixty percent up front.  I'm practically financing his operation.  And now this nickel-and-dime business?
15621/0:Someone's got to fix the nanoformer or release that repair bot.
15622/0:That riot was started by the workers NOT the Order --
15623/0:Meanwhile, all hell has broken loose at the Panzerwerks factory.
15624/0:Concert...?
15625/0:We both wanted to be artists.  I admire the way she stuck to her guns and made it big.
15626/0:I bet it IS a drill.  Some kind of test...
15627/0:We get paid just the same.  That's the only standard that matters to me.
15628/0:Very well done.  The schematic has already proven useful.  We have learned that the armor contains a weak spot, triangular in shape, on the back.
15629/0:I just think someone should take over.  There isn't any GOVERNMENT anymore.  Can't even get a decent meal most of the time.
15630/0:Intruders are storming the facility.  Evacuate immediately.
15631/0:Once I was like you, mindlessly consuming -- but you've always felt something was missing.  Join the Order and let Her Holiness help you find it.
15632/0:I do not understand why you insist on following the WTO's greed and self-interest.  Think about all the people that will be endangered now that they have the schematics for this weapon.  May Her Holiness help you find a way out of the WTO's snare.
15633/0:You are true to JC.
15634/0:Templars!  
15634/1:Hit 'em hard.
15634/2:Attack!
15635/0:I'm on Dr. Nassif's tail.  The program we came out of -- ApostleCorp -- it's based here in Cairo.
15636/0:That's why we're here -- to learn what we can from this experiment before the conspirators try to infect the rest of humanity.
15637/0:The idiot didn't follow through, though.  Tina just pumped Gob-zilla's hide full of zyme, and now there's my poor Snake-eyes up against Gob-zilla squared.  Poor guy doesn't stand a chance.  What I woulda paid to have the job done right.
15638/0:No new news on the fifteen global Nanite Swells.  Except for a significant shift in Swell 9 five years ago due to some el nino activity, no change or disintegration has ever been observed in them.  
15639/0:I'm just doing my job here.  Talk to someone at HQ.
15640/0:This'll be twenty-three in a row.  Put your money on 'Zilla, buy yourself a villa.
15641/0:She's all yours.
15642/0:You can hardly criticize me after you've been injuring innocents by shooting up the SSC station.
15643/0:Just a minute.
15644/0:
15645/0:Mean sons-a-bitches, that's for sure.
15646/0:You will be impressed.  Speak with the trader.
15647/0:(grunt) Watch it!
15647/1:(grunt) ... thought we were working together.
15648/0:Don't get my best pilot into any trouble.
15649/0:The WTO is fighting an invisible war against several formidable enemies.  Give us your loyalty, Alex.  We need it.
15650/0:(grunt) Watch it!
15650/1:(grunt) ... thought we were working together.
15651/0:Templars!  
15651/1:Hit 'em hard.
15651/2:Attack!
15652/0:I'm gonna have to order you to take a hike.
15652/1:Cool it.
15653/0:Put that beast out of its misery!
15653/1:Take down that monster.  Now!
15654/0:Report to Mr. Dumier.
15655/0:Now my boss is looking for someone else to do his dirty work.  Huh.  Corporate terrorism against a coffeeshop.  I'd like to meet the scab that takes THAT job.
15656/0:I'm gonna have to order you to take a hike.
15656/1:Cool it.
15657/0:Put that beast out of its misery!
15657/1:Take down that monster.  Now!
15658/0:Hey, careful!
15658/1:Keep your hands to yourself.
15658/2:Don't mess with me.
15658/3:I said WATCH IT!
15658/4:Do NOT push an SSC guard!
15658/5:You're a real jerk -- know that?
15659/0:Take care of that freak!
15659/1:Get rid of that abomination!
15660/0:Nothing personal.
15661/0:Hey, careful!
15661/1:Keep your hands to yourself.
15661/2:Don't mess with me.
15661/3:Are you DRUNK?
15661/4:Hands off.  Show a little respect.
15661/5:(grunt) Real smart.  I've been known to misfire my weapon for a lot less than THAT.
15662/0:Take care of that freak!
15662/1:Get rid of that abomination!
15663/0:Sorry.  I had some business to take care of in Trier.
15664/0:Used to have this little single-prop airplane.  Flew an ammo run for Sophia Sak.  Not bad for a scab like me.
15665/0:You're starting to bug me.
15665/1:Stop looking at me.
15665/2:If you want something -- speak up!
15665/3:Are you some sort of whacko?
15665/4:Go make eyes at someone else.
15666/0:Now show her who's boss.
15667/0:You're starting to bug me.
15667/1:Stop looking at me.
15667/2:What are you lookin' at, anyway?
15667/3:Okay.  Enough staring.
15667/4:You're in the way.
15668/0:Now show her who's boss.
15669/0:From now on, you better watch your back.
15670/0:You're creepin' me out, man.  Go away.
15671/0:You're creepin' me out, man.  Go away.
15672/0:Now show him who's boss.
15673/0:Now show him who's boss.
15674/0:Good idea.
15674/1:Let's go for it.
15674/2:Ho!
15675/0:Is ApostleCorp really such a serious threat that it's a concern to the Director of the WTO?
15676/0:Enough talk, if you don't mind.  You are spoiling the mood.
15677/0:To prevent us from overpowering our masters by sheer numbers, we were created unable to reproduce.  That is why the Templar threat to us is so dire -- we are all that remains.
15678/0:I was a real loser before I landed this job.
15679/0:My poor baby...
15680/0:
15680/1:
15680/2:
15680/3:
15681/0:
15682/0:You're creepin' me out, lady.  Go away.
15683/0:You're creepin' me out, lady.  Go away.
15684/0:Good idea.
15684/1:Let's go for it.
15684/2:Ho!
15685/0:Come on.  Cut it out.
15685/1:Stop that.
15685/2:You're not making my job any easier.
15685/3:I'm under strict orders not to put up with this sort of thing.
15685/4:Hey!  Stop it!
15685/5:Consider this your official warning...
15685/6:You better cut that out -- pronto!
15685/7:Just my luck... this crazy shows up right before the end of my shift...
15686/0:That was a truly awful match.
15686/1:I sure could use a bite to eat.
15686/2:Gah!  This shift just goes on forever.
15686/3:This is NOT what I signed on for...
15686/4:I guess they recruit just about anybody who spouts the party line...
15686/5:Haven't seen equipment like that since before the Collapse...
15686/6:Need more time on the rifle range.
15686/7:Hell yeah I can pull my weight... and pull his, too...
15686/8:Next they'll try to splice it into HUMANS...
15687/0:Come on.  Cut it out.
15687/1:Stop that.
15687/2:You're not making my job any easier.
15687/3:I'm under strict orders not to put up with this sort of thing.
15687/4:Cut that out RIGHT NOW!
15687/5:I'm not supposed to allow that.
15687/6:I'm going to have to open a file on you...
15687/7:You're gonna get yourself in a world of trouble.
15688/0:That was a truly awful match.
15688/1:I sure could use a bite to eat.
15688/2:Gah!  This shift just goes on forever.
15688/3:This is NOT what I signed on for...
15689/0:Didn't I tell you to leave?
15689/1:Get out of here.  You better listen to me.
15689/2:You aren't authorized to be here.
15690/0:(hum)
15690/1:(whistle)
15690/2:(sing)
15690/3:(yawn)
15691/0:Didn't I tell you to leave?
15691/1:Get out of here.  You better listen to me.
15691/2:You aren't authorized to be here.
15692/0:(hum)
15692/1:(whistle)
15692/2:(sing)
15692/3:(yawn)
15693/0:
15694/0:I'll defend myself if I have to.
15694/1:What's your beef with me?
15694/2:You better put away the weapon.
15695/0:Gotta do something about this rat problem already.
15696/0:I'll defend myself if I have to.
15696/1:What's your beef with me?
15696/2:You better put away the weapon.
15697/0:One accident down here -- WHAMMO!  We could lose power to the whole building.
15698/0:(grunt) Watch your aim, dammit!
15698/1:(grunt) Jesus!  Watch it!
15699/0:Gotta do something about this rat problem already.
15700/0:(grunt) Watch your aim, dammit!
15700/1:(grunt) Jesus!  Watch it!
15701/0:Here kitty kitty.
15702/0:Here kitty kitty.
15703/0:Back off!  Can't you see I'm busy?!
15703/1:I'm in the middle of something here.  Can't talk.
15704/0:Did you turn up anything?
15705/0:Always the same formula, though.  Noise, beer, attitude.
15706/0:
15707/0:Sand everywhere.  Ick.  And this haze!
15708/0:
15708/1:
15708/2:
15708/3:
15708/4:
15708/5:
15709/0:I didn't know the Omar employed non-cyborgs.
15710/0:First you must agree to abide by certain rules.  Number One -- membership is confidential.  You do not disclose the names of other members to ANYONE.  Understand?
15711/0:Handle it?  Sid Black invented the TERM "hostile insertion."  I'll meet you outside the tavern.
15712/0:I've been talking with their High Augur, Lin May Chen. There was some miscommunication about the raid but the main objectives were still accomplished.  They showed us what was really going on behind the scenes and freed us.  I'm grateful, and you should be too.
15713/0:If our other facilities survive, you will learn why.  Until then, to reveal more would be unwise.
15714/0:Don't take long.
15715/0:Enough.  You're wearing me out.
15716/0:My alliances are my own concern.  But yes, I'm heading to Mako next.
15717/0:You know this for certain?  I can take a break and don't have to worry?
15718/0:Okay.
15719/0:You've pushed me a little too far.
15719/1:I'm warning you...
15719/2:Do what I say, dammit!
15720/0:I was just over by the Heron's Loft landing pad.  How'd Sophia Sak manage to get your jet?  Did you owe her money?
15721/0:You've pushed me a little too far.
15721/1:I'm warning you...
15721/2:Do what I say, dammit!
15722/0:Back off!  Can't you see I'm busy?!
15722/1:I'm in the middle of something here.  Can't talk.
15723/0:You're pushing your luck, man.
15724/0:Oops!
15724/1:I'm so sorry...
15725/0:Watch it, Alex!  I think I saw a sniper on the roof!
15726/0:You're pushing your luck, man.
15727/0:Oops!
15727/1:I'm so sorry...
15728/0:There's no good reason for them to lock us in the facility like this.
15729/0:For Christ's sake, lady!
15730/0:Cool it.
15730/1:Knock it off.
15730/2:You are not amusing.
15731/0:For Christ's sake, lady!
15732/0:Cool it.
15732/1:Knock it off.
15732/2:You are not amusing.
15733/0:This is your last warning.
15733/1:They expect me to use force in a situation like this.
15733/2:You better back down.
15733/3:Last chance!  I mean it!
15733/4:Respect my authority or I'm gonna take action!
15734/0:This is your last warning.
15734/1:They expect me to use force in a situation like this.
15734/2:You better back down.
15734/3:Last chance!  I mean it!
15734/4:Respect my authority or I'm gonna take action!
15735/0:You will accord me the proper respect!
15735/1:Pay attention to where you're walking.
15735/2:Step out of the way.
15735/3:Next time watch where you're going.
15735/4:Don't test me.
15735/5:Ow.  You filthy little...
15736/0:You had me worried there.
15736/1:Don't do that again.
15737/0:You will accord me the proper respect!
15737/1:Pay attention to where you're walking.
15738/0:You had me worried there.
15738/1:Don't do that again.
15739/0:Watch where you're aiming, you fool.
15739/1: What are you doing?!  You just HIT me.
15740/0:Watch where you're aiming, you fool.
15740/1: What are you doing?!  You just HIT me.
15741/0:It's impolite to stare.
15741/1:Find someone else to gawk at.
15741/2:Never seen a Templar paladin?
15742/0:Tell me what you want me to do.
15743/0:What's the hold up?
15744/0:Oh, please.  Just take me back downtown.
15745/0:We're not alone down here.
15746/0:Sloppy work, kiddo.
15747/0:You an NG Resonance fan?  We just downloaded the NG chat construct on the kiosk by the stairs.  You should check it out.
15748/0:
15749/0:JC is waiting.  He will need to transmit your profile.  How can I help?
15750/0:D for Upper Seattle Darling?
15751/0:The Omar spread like bacteria.  Now they're infecting the WTO enclaves.
15752/0:That's one of them.
15753/0:Stay here.
15754/0:Nicolette was right -- to reshape history, all you need are a few carefully chosen ideas.
15755/0:I saw one of your troopers killed and now this place is being stormed!  What's going on?!
15756/0:Damn bot.  
15757/0:Hold on!
15757/1:Sorry -- I've got things to do.
15757/2:Let me deal with this first!
15758/0:Tension has been high for months.  It just finally exploded.
15759/0:Alex -- no second thoughts, and no violence.  I'll protect Dr. Nassif myself if I have to.
15760/0:Hold on!
15760/1:Sorry -- I've got things to do.
15760/2:Let me deal with this first!
15761/0:It's impolite to stare.
15761/1:Find someone else to gawk at.
15762/0:By the time they thaw him out, people won't be people anymore.  They'll be food for microscopic machines.
15763/0:(gasp)  What did I do?
15763/1:Screwed THAT up.
15763/2:Don't look at me.  They never trained me for that thing.
15764/0:Hilarious.
15764/1:Watch what you're doing.
15764/2:I can do without your nonsense.
15764/3:Better leave that alone.
15764/4:I saw that.  Hey, you!
15764/5:Take it somewhere else.
15765/0:(gasp)  What did I do?
15765/1:Screwed THAT up.
15765/2:Don't look at me.  They never trained me for that thing.
15766/0:Hilarious.
15766/1:Watch what you're doing.
15766/2:I can do without your nonsense.
15767/0:It's stuck!
15767/1:I can't open it.
15768/0:You're kidding right?
15768/1:I'm a Templar.  You're nobody.  Now stop this foolishness.
15769/0:Welcome, Alex.  I see that you're awake.
15770/0:It's stuck!
15770/1:I can't open it.
15771/0:Not that I know of, but Dr. Nassif did give me a strange reply when I mentioned the Dentons.
15772/0:I can't get through!
15772/1:It's in my way!
15773/0:You're kidding right?
15773/1:I'm a Templar.  You're nobody.  Now stop this foolishness.
15774/0:I can't get through!
15774/1:It's in my way!
15775/0:This is a restricted area.  Move along before I move you myself.
15775/1:You're trespassing.  Get lost.
15776/0:(grunt)
15776/1:(grunt)
15777/0:This is a restricted area.  Move along before I move you myself.
15777/1:You're trespassing.  Get lost.
15778/0:Order be praised -- those crooks have been trying to run us out of town.  Now take care of Sak so that she can't hire replacements.
15779/0:(grunt)
15779/1:(grunt)
15780/0:I'm really getting tired of your nonsense.
15780/1:You're trying my patience.
15781/0:I'm really getting tired of your nonsense.
15781/1:You're trying my patience.
15782/0:Go ahead.  Send the code.
15783/0:Wish I had more cash.  I'd bet more.  [250 credits.]
15784/0:I just got an update from Chief Morgan -- what were you thinking?  Are you letting the Order turn you into a fanatical assassin?  You could've helped the WTO and they could've helped you.  But now my orders are to neutralize you, just like any other extremist operative.
15785/0:Watch it!
15785/1:I've had just about enough of this jostling!
15785/2:Not too smart, are you?
15785/3:Don't push a Templar.
15785/4:Back off.  Think I won't use this?
15785/5:Thanks.  Now I've got to get it cleaned.
15786/0:I don't think she's your type.
15787/0:I'm sure Chief Morgan knows what she's doing.
15788/0:Why not?  They're both terrorist acts.
15789/0:Not if we have anything to do with it.
15790/0:Just don't move in on any of my prospects.  I'll let you know.
15791/0:We appreciate your dedication.
15792/0:You have been conditioned by this society.  You suffer from vasana, my seekers.  Hindu yogis have also warned their students of this flaw.  You are too attached to the superficial and the material.  Let me help you discover your true selves.  Turn away from this false sense of self-limitation to know your true self.  
15793/0:I'm not goin' THAT way...
15793/1:I'm not CRAZY...
15794/0:All I want is to understand what happened -- the kidnapping, Saman leaving the Church, a Templar army...
15795/0:The cockpit of a helicopter is a funny place to try and meet people.
15796/0:I'm not goin' THAT way...
15796/1:I'm not CRAZY...
15797/0:Watch it!
15797/1:I've had just about enough of this jostling!
15798/0:Stop -- it's too dangerous.
15799/0:You are about to cross the line and become my enemy.
15799/1:You keep that up and I'll show you real target practice, friend.
15800/0:Stop -- it's too dangerous.
15801/0:You are about to cross the line and become my enemy.
15801/1:You keep that up and I'll show you real target practice, friend.
15802/0:This is our haven from the madness and greed the WTO tries to spread.
15803/0:Stop staring at ME!
15803/1:I'll give you more than the evil eye if you don't cut it out.
15803/2:Keep moving.
15803/3:Better not try anything, kid.
15803/4:Take a step back.
15804/0:I'll get help!
15804/1:They must not know we're being attacked.  Be right back.
15804/2:... going for backup!
15805/0:Stop staring at ME!
15805/1:I'll give you more than the evil eye if you don't cut it out.
15806/0:I'll get help!
15806/1:They must not know we're being attacked.  Be right back.
15806/2:... going for backup!
15807/0:Stop acting like a fool.
15807/1:You're really starting to wear on my nerves.
15807/2:That's not wise.
15807/3:Don't make me...
15807/4:I'm licensed to use this, you know.
15808/0:Not worth it!
15808/1:This is crazy!
15808/2:I'm out.  // 
15808/3:You take it from here.
15808/4:This shit's not in my contract...
15808/5:All right -- just don't hurt me!
15808/6:I'm not cut out for this job...!
15808/7:It's just my job!  Jeez!
15808/8:I'm not going to be another statistic!
15809/0:Stop acting like a fool.
15809/1:You're really starting to wear on my nerves.
15810/0:Not worth it!
15810/1:This is crazy!
15810/2:I'm out.
15810/3:You take it from here.
15810/4:This is out of control!
15810/5:Not worth it!
15810/6:I'm gonna run while I can!
15811/0:Knock it off!
15811/1:You're not prepared to deal with the consequences.
15811/2:It would behoove you to back off.
15812/0:How do I know you won't change your tune once you have the technology?
15813/0:Knock it off!
15813/1:You're not prepared to deal with the consequences.
15813/2:It would behoove you to back off.
15814/0:Queequeg's -- coffee for a new generation.
15815/0:This area is restricted!  Get out of here!
15815/1:This isn't a game.
15815/2:Get out of here, before I SHOW you the exit.
15816/0:The Knights Templar have found recruits in strange places.  The enclaves are very concerned about tracking their activities.
15817/0:The only killers I've seen so far are your Order troopers.
15818/0:Excellent.  You've done much to bring peace to this neglected part of the city.  Maybe you can find Sid Black at the Greasel Pit bar to give him the good news about his jet.
15819/0:Recipient not found.
15820/0:Listen to me -- I'm sure you have more important things to do today.
15821/0:How 'bout it?  Two Sunfires, double the damage.
15822/0:The flight deck is off limits to unauthorized personnel.
15823/0:You seem pretty calm.  Most of the other kids around here seem pretty riled up.
15824/0:I'm sorry, but your request violates protocol.  You need to have an account with us and contact us by the approved means.  Thank you for your interest.
15825/0:I'd buy the door code off you, but I don't have the funds.  [250 credits.]
15826/0:I'm gonna throw one!
15826/1:Here goes nothin'...
15826/2:Tryin' a grenade...
15827/0:I'm gonna throw one!
15827/1:Here goes nothin'...
15827/2:Tryin' a grenade...
15828/0:This area is restricted!  Get out of here!
15828/1:This isn't a game. 
15828/2:Get out of here, before I SHOW you the exit.
15829/0:It's live!  Look out!
15829/1:It's gonna blow!
15829/2:Someone lit a sparkler...  // foreboding
15830/0:  You're going to pay for this if you don't knock it off.
15830/1: I've had just about enough of this!
15831/0:It's live!  Look out!
15831/1:It's gonna blow!
15831/2:Someone lit a sparkler...  // foreboding
15832/0:So much outside The Plan.  It must be set right.
15833/0:Better keep my distance.  Looks like some sort of munition.
15833/1:Better not trip it...
15834/0:  You're going to pay for this if you don't knock it off.
15834/1: I've had just about enough of this!
15835/0:Better keep my distance.  Looks like some sort of munition.
15835/1:Better not trip it...
15836/0:I warned you that this would happen...
15836/1:By Baphomet, I'll show you I mean business.
15837/0:You'll have to tell me later.
15837/1:Hold on -- I don't think we're alone.
15838/0:I warned you that this would happen...
15838/1:By Baphomet, I'll show you I mean business.
15839/0:You'll have to tell me later.
15839/1:Hold on -- I don't think we're alone.
15840/0:Gah!  I hope you're finished.  //sarcastic
15840/1:Okay, I hope you got that all out of your system now.//sarcastic
15841/0:How about I bug your chopper and make this learning process go both ways?
15842/0:Danger!  Look out!  Just tell me where the threat is, and I'll take care of it.
15842/1:Which way?   // urgent
15843/0:Gah!  I hope you're finished.  //sarcastic
15843/1:Okay, I hope you got that all out of your system now.//sarcastic
15844/0:Watch yourself.
15845/0:Danger!  Look out!  Just tell me where the threat is, and I'll take care of it.
15845/1:Which way?   // urgent
15846/0:Trying to get the better of ME...?  NEVER!
15846/1:Courage.  Victory is swift for the pure of heart.
15846/2:A fight!  Show your worth, paladins!
15846/3:This is what we trained for!
15847/0:I know we just deployed some troops somewhere in Europe.... Germany, I think.  It's possible they're going after another lab like this one.
15848/0:Trying to get the better of ME...?  NEVER!
15848/1:Courage.  Victory is swift for the pure of heart.
15848/2:A fight!  Show your worth, paladins!
15849/0:Going for backup.
15849/1:I've got to find us some help.
15850/0:Your rescue of Paul Denton has prevented us from testing the procedure, however.  My people don't trust you, so expect resistance from my paladins until you prove yourself.  It would be foolish of us to take your word for anything.
15851/0:Don't be ridiculous.  We can handle one Order Seeker.
15852/0:Headmaster Archer,  There have been some strange rumors regarding your conduct toward students.  We are sure this is only idle gossip, but Tarsus must also urge you to police your behavior so that we may remain above reproach or suspicion.
15853/0:Just confirming my departure.  No contact from Cairo yet.  I don't know what we'll do if headquarters gets hit as well.  More after I arrive in Egypt.
15854/0:You know my name.
15855/0:We were not meant for mindless subsistence.  We were not meant for clock time -- no, not in this world, nor in the next.
15856/0:We will bring you more details as they become available.
15857/0:Hm...
15857/1:That's strange...
15857/2:What was that?
15858/0:Sure.
15859/0:Hm...
15859/1:That's strange...
15859/2:What was that?
15859/3:Eh?
15859/4:Probably nothing.
15859/5:Doubt it matters.
15859/6:What?
15859/7:That's odd.
15860/0:Someone there?
15860/1:Okay.  Now I'm curious.
15860/2:I hope this is nothing...
15861/0:You hurt all you encounter, our colony and JC.  You must be destroyed.
15862/0:Again?
15862/1:Wonder why it keeps doing that.
15862/2:How am I supposed to take a nap?
15862/3:Hope no one expects me to look into that.
15862/4:Whatever.
15863/0:Chicks never listen when I say I run freight.
15864/0:I'm tracking an armed criminal.  See anything?
15865/0:Get ready -- I don't like this.
15866/0:I'm tracking an armed criminal.  See anything?
15867/0:Get ready -- I don't like this.
15868/0:Going for backup.
15868/1:I've got to find us some help.
15869/0:Enough talk.  We both have work to do.
15870/0:Someone tried to fight us.  Can you help?
15871/0:Huh?  Guess I better keep my eyes open...
15872/0:Someone tried to fight us.  Can you help?
15873/0:Huh?  Guess I better keep my eyes open...
15874/0:I can't take any more!
15874/1:Pulling back!
15874/2:I'm out of options!
15874/3:Time to regroup!
15874/4:By Purity, I will live!
15874/5:Impossible!
15875/0:
15875/1:
15875/2:
15876/0:I'm after a guy who attacked a security guard.  See anyone?
15877/0:Wonder what caused the noise.
15877/1:Sounded like a person... Hm.
15878/0:I can't take any more!
15878/1:Pulling back!
15879/0:I'm after a guy who attacked a security guard.  See anyone?
15880/0:Wonder what caused the noise.
15880/1:Sounded like a person... Hm.
15881/0:Fire in the hole!
15881/1:Chew on this!
15882/0:I'm after a woman who attacked a security guard.  See anyone?
15883/0:Fire in the hole!
15883/1:Chew on this!
15884/0:I'm after a woman who attacked a security guard.  See anyone?
15885/0:Explosive!
15885/1:Look out!  It's live!
15886/0:I'm in the middle of a pursuit right now.  Tell me what you know.
15887/0:Explosive!
15887/1:Look out!  It's live!
15888/0:I'm in the middle of a pursuit right now.  Tell me what you know.
15889/0:Whoa.  The place is boobytrapped.
15889/1:Nice.  I wonder who's responsible.
15890/0:
15891/0:Whoa.  The place is boobytrapped.
15891/1:Nice.  I wonder who's responsible.
15892/0:Watchin' two poor gobs tear each other apart... Now what's that say about human nature?
15893/0:I'm after someone who attacked me.  Did anyone come through here?  
15893/1:Looking to finish off a trespasser.  Anyone suspicious come by?
15894/0:
15895/0:An unfortunate circumstance for both parties.
15896/0:I knew my boy didn't stand a chance against 'Zilla, but I had to step up to the plate.
15897/0:You can't get me a ride?
15898/0:Promptly, I assume.
15899/0:Not this time.  They found a cure and reprogrammed the bots.
15900/0:Well, hello again...
15901/0:Actually, Leo and I requested to be sent here, because this is where you finish training and get briefed on your first assignment.  Isn't it exciting?  I wonder what company I'll be working for.
15902/0:So.  Alex.  You know that thing you've got in your head that lets people interrupt your thoughts from anywhere on the planet?
15903/0:She was quite a lady about it, actually.  I have everything I need.
15904/0:My records show that that empty wastewater canal connects every building in this district.  Perhaps the local residents know more.  I have been investigating this district myself due to occurrences of my passenger's name in certain communications.
15905/0:Activate the nodes, reconnect him with the waking.  But beware:  the other key has made her own plans.
15906/0:Huh.  Something must've caused that.
15907/0:Huh.  Something must've caused that.
15908/0:I can predict the future because I know the past.
15909/0:Now what?
15909/1:Maybe it was something after all...
15909/2:Hm.  Can't be a coincidence...
15909/3:Huh.  Starting to see a pattern...
15910/0:Now what?
15910/1:Maybe it was something after all...
15910/2:Hm.  Can't be a coincidence...
15910/3:Huh.  Starting to see a pattern...
15911/0:Sorry -- my mistake!
15912/0:See anyone suspicious hanging around?
15912/1:I seem to be on the trail of someone who doesn't want to be found.  Can you help?
15913/0:Gah!  Nothing.
15913/1:(sigh) False alarm...
15913/2:Forget it.
15913/3:Could be wrong, I guess.
15913/4:Damn... always jumpin' to conclusions...
15914/0:I keep an eye on the troublemakers.
15915/0:I won't revel in a QueeQueg's bankruptcy, but it would be good for consumers.
15916/0:See anyone suspicious hanging around?
15916/1:I seem to be on the trail of someone who doesn't want to be found.  Can you help?
15917/0:Gah!  Nothing.
15917/1:(sigh) False alarm...
15917/2:Forget it.
15917/3:Could be wrong, I guess.
15917/4:Damn... always jumpin' to conclusions...
15918/0:That's right.
15919/0:See a man come through here?
15920/0:I think it's nothing.
15921/0:At least I'm safe at my school... 
15922/0:See a man come through here?
15923/0:I think it's nothing.
15924/0:See a woman come through here?
15925/0:THOUGHT I saw something...
15926/0:Still, I'm worried.  We need to uproot this ApostleCorp before they compromise our modernization.  I hear that the Grand Master will be ready to act within two months, but our army will need to be a match for all other armies combined.
15927/0:See a woman come through here?
15928/0:THOUGHT I saw something...
15929/0:Really?  Great.  I'll give you the exterminator's fee then.  Thanks for your help.
15930/0:Building manager.  I need to check the pipes.
15931/0:What's going on?
15931/1:You make anything of it?
15932/0:They're everywhere. And they're growling.
15933/0:What's going on?
15933/1:You make anything of it?
15934/0:See something?
15935/0:Choice.  The essence of the free market and of freedom itself.  You DEMAND choice, and that's why you welcome the expansion of Pequod's Coffee.  Our drinks are the result of unprecedented innovation in both processing and brewing technologies.  They're healthy, fun, and, well, ALMOST free.  Pequod's -- coming soon to YOUR home town.
15936/0:Kill him, you fool!
15937/0:See something?
15938/0:I'm positive that the missing students will be found.
15939/0:It would be a start.  I'm so sick of these nobodies expecting me to do special favors for them and not even having a few credits to compensate me for my trouble.  What about you?  Are you just a fan or do you have a good reason for bothering me?
15940/0:At least the air has cleared up.  You must be the stranger everyone talks about, our part-time savior...
15941/0:That's the head scientist.  Talk to him -- find out how to access the housing unit that contains the Mag Rail.  He may be the only one who has the necessary clearance.
15942/0:We were hoping you would run into Dr. Nassif's uncle here, but it looks like he is one step ahead of us.  After you destroy the hydroponics, why don't you pay him a visit?  His apartment is on the second floor of a building across the square from the Order church.
15943/0:Now we don't have a defending champ.  Business'll probably fall off until we can get some legitimacy for a new one.
15944/0:Certainly.  Well done.
15945/0:Looks like people from Tarsus are mixed up in that transaction.  I'd like to know why they're running equipment to Mako Ballistics -- and why a weapon called the Mag Rail has been commissioned by the Knights Templar.  Report to the air terminal.  We have a lot to discuss.
15946/0:Nice day, at least.  Might as well enjoy it for now.
15947/0:What a day.
15948/0:Stop hangin' around me.  People are gonna notice.
15949/0:Well, it's take-it-back or take-back, feeb.  Red ain't foolin'.  He's more scabland than a greasel pit-fighter.
15950/0:This unexpected change is great news for the citizens of Old Cairo who had grown accustomed to the permanent haze which was suspected by many to be the cause of the higher incidence of certain diseases in the medina.
15951/0:THOUGHT I heard something...
15951/1:Just random noises, I guess.
15952/0:THOUGHT I heard something...
15952/1:Just random noises, I guess.
15953/0:Could've been an accident, maybe.
15954/0:Could've been an accident, maybe.
15955/0:Isn't that a person?
15956/0:Hope they don't make me pay for it.
15957/0:Oh my!
15958/0:
15959/0:Isn't that a person?
15960/0:Hope they don't make me pay for it.
15961/0:Hear something?
15962/0:Guess they got away with it.
15962/1:Wonder what they were after.
15963/0:Hear something?
15964/0:Guess they got away with it.
15964/1:Wonder what they were after.
15965/0:I felt something.  Is something going on?
15966/0:Maybe it just fell.
15967/0:I felt something.  Is something going on?
15968/0:Maybe it just fell.
15969/0:Sure.
15970/0:You're starting to make me nervous, man.
15971/0:A shadow.  Did you see it?
15972/0:A shadow.  Did you see it?
15973/0:Wow, blood.  Know how it got here?
15974/0:Wow, blood.  Know how it got here?
15975/0:I never expected something like this to happen.  A raid?  I thought we were prepared for every eventuality.
15976/0:The only safe way to deal with such dangerous power in such an unstable individual is to destroy him.  It's the only way.
15977/0:Uh, sorry.  Mr. O'Rourke is busy.
15978/0:Vera Maxwell -- Executive Commander for the SSC.
15979/0:They've set up in the abandoned Hartford Turbine factory.  You a Seeker?  You don't look the type.
15980/0:The nanomanipulators in the Minister of Culture's penthouse were intended for scientists in this lab.  Search the lab director's office for evidence about Dr. Nassif's whereabouts.
15981/0:You're an impressionable young lady.  Do you have any idea what you just liberated from the ice?  No matter.  The brother, Paul, is in my custody, and such he will stay.
15982/0:Whatever.  I'm not the janitor.
15983/0:Hi, NG, I hope you're listening.  I'd like to meet you for real sometime.
15984/0:Whatever.  I'm not the janitor.
15985/0:Maybe they smelled a gob go by...
15986/0:Maybe they smelled a gob go by...
15987/0:Who's responsible?
15987/1:Is the weasel still in the area?
15988/0:Maybe it was already shut.  Oh well.
15989/0:Who's responsible?
15989/1:Is the weasel still in the area?
15990/0:Maybe it was already shut.  Oh well.
15991/0:Where's the murderer?
15991/1:Oh my god... Who did this?
15992/0:Coulda come open by itself, I guess.
15993/0:Where's the murderer?
15993/1:Oh my god... Who did this?
15994/0:Coulda come open by itself, I guess.
15995/0:
15996/0:Out cold.  Well.  Who did this?
15997/0:It was probably on before.  I just didn't notice.
15998/0:JC's vision two decades ago was far ahead of our means to implement it, but that is about to change.
15999/0:Out cold.  Well.  Who did this?
16000/0:It was probably on before.  I just didn't notice.
16001/0:Who knocked him out?
16002/0:Who knocked him out?
16003/0:The Omar are right.  It's too late for me.
16004/0:Who knocked her out?
16005/0:Who knocked her out?
16006/0:My mind is already working.  I think I see an opportunity, in fact.  The Pequod's manager had a black-market operation.  I could cover it up and tell management I was merely "protecting the reputation of the coffee industry."
16007/0:I should've gone to the factory myself.  Maybe I should just face it -- I was scared.
16008/0:Hey, lady.  Listen up.  Wanna scrip' some REAL cash?  You look like the mercenary type.
16009/0:I knew we could count on you, Alex.
16010/0:If you have the key, it means you've been okayed by security to access the rest of Trier.
16011/0:Nothing unusual about that.  SSC gives clients a say about who ends up working for them.
16012/0:Your cavalier attitude toward human life is disgusting...  I should have expected as much after you failed us in New Cairo.  I really wish you would reconsider your allegiances.
16013/0:I do not believe she got kicked out -- We would have all heard about that by now.  It must be something else...  Maybe she is hiding...
16014/0:The WTO wants to know some specifics about your research, Dr. Nassif, and where it's still being carried out.  Tell me more about this Tracer Tong and the facility in Trier.
16015/0:Maybe it went off by itself.
16016/0:In the long run, I guess this chaos means job security for the SSC.  That's what I keep telling myself, at least.
16017/0:I heard he's one of their leaders, and they put him into a deep sleep to wait for something.  I don't know what, but it must be pretty important.
16018/0:Maybe it went off by itself.
16019/0:Damn!  Got away...
16019/1:Next time I won't get caught nappin'.
16019/2:Scared of my uniform, I guess.
16020/0:You could've told me and the other trainees about the experiments.
16021/0:Damn!  Got away...
16021/1:Next time I won't get caught nappin'.
16021/2:Scared of my uniform, I guess.
16022/0:He better be gone...  // apprehensive
16022/1:Lost him.
16023/0:He better be gone...  // apprehensive
16023/1:Lost him.
16024/0:No....!  NO!  The Templars are destroying the Helios core!  Satisfied, Alex?  I'm mortal like you again.  Helios won't be able to save me this time, but I don't plan to be the one who needs saving.
16025/0:She better be gone...  // apprehensive
16025/1:Lost her.
16026/0:She better be gone...  // apprehensive
16026/1:Lost her.
16027/0:Panzerwerks did not take kindly to our efforts to open their eyes to the harm they are causing the Earth.
16028/0:Gone.  Tough break, I guess.
16028/1:Nothing.  Hope we don't get written up for this.
16028/2:Guess we better give up.
16029/0:Gone.  Tough break, I guess.
16029/1:Nothing.  Hope we don't get written up for this.
16029/2:Guess we better give up.
16030/0:So this is the end of Apostlecorp?
16031/0:
16031/1:
16032/0:I knew Chicken-liver was a serious player cuz of the chipped teeth.
16033/0:Slick lady like you?  You could come up with the cash if you really wanted to.
16034/0:It's a powerful thing, seeing a great leader stand there speechless.  He was utterly shaken by the news.
16035/0:Likewise.
16036/0:You better let me get back to work.
16037/0:Selfish scum.
16038/0:Wait here.  I'll be back.
16039/0:I can't afford the energy cells right now. [300]
16040/0:I can't believe we let him get away.
16041/0:I can't believe we let him get away.
16042/0:I can't believe we let her get away.
16043/0:I can't believe we let her get away.
16044/0:The assailant got away.
16044/1:Whatever.  I don't want any trouble.
16045/0:The assailant got away.
16045/1:Whatever.  I don't want any trouble.
16046/0:I don't have much to offer as a reward, but maybe I can help you against the terrorists.  My husband works for the SSC.  He's training in Madrid right now, but I know the code to the SSC kiosk in the arcology.  6673.  Help yourself to any equipment you need.
16047/0:Jerk.  Next time he's the one who gets hurt.
16048/0:Jerk.  Next time he's the one who gets hurt.
16049/0:You're our secret weapon.
16050/0:Who are YOU?
16051/0:Crazy chick.  Next time she's the one who gets hurt.
16052/0:Whatever pettiness it was, they're all gone now.
16053/0:As you wish.  JC will make his case when we reach Liberty Island, but expect to prove yourself before he will trust you again. 
16054/0:Crazy chick.  Next time she's the one who gets hurt.
16055/0:You better let me get back to work.
16056/0:The payment first, please.
16057/0:
16058/0:I think it will, because --
16059/0:I'm glad you were able to see through the Headmaster's facade.  He had the parents all fooled.
16060/0:Wish I had more cash.  I'd bet more.  [500 credits.]
16061/0:What do you know about the Templar defenses?
16062/0:You are about to cross the line. 
16062/1:This is it.  Don't push me any further.
16063/0:You are about to cross the line. 
16063/1:This is it.  Don't push me any further.
16064/0:The Templars can't possibly be paying enough taxes on their little project.  They're transporting Powered Assault Armor and in large numbers.
16065/0:You are about to cross the line. 
16065/1:This is it.  Don't push me any further.
16066/0:Stand by us, Alex.
16067/0:You're telling ME.  I know a guy who works at Symmetriad.  He says nanoformers could rebuild all of Seattle in about five years.
16068/0:You are about to cross the line. 
16068/1:This is it.  Don't push me any further.
16069/0:You are about to cross the line. 
16069/1:This is it.  Don't push me any further.
16070/0:Nothing.  If we wanna save face, we better stop the next attack before it happens.
16071/0:You are about to cross the line. 
16071/1:This is it.  Don't push me any further.
16072/0:Nothing.  If we wanna save face, we better stop the next attack before it happens.
16073/0:The WTO could really use an agent like you, and we could offer you a kind of mobility no one else can.
16074/0:You are about to cross the line. 
16074/1:This is it.  Don't push me any further.
16075/0:Oh God, what a nightmare.  This is gonna be my ass.
16075/1:No sign of the assassin.  Guess there's nothing I can do.
16075/2:Damn, the killer must've run off.
16076/0:Sorry.  No access to the Black Gate without the proper clearance.
16077/0:You have my compliments.  I heard through the grapevine that you gave the WTO a tip that led to the assassination of the cyborg.  That'll buy me a month or two until the Omar sneak another one into town.
16078/0:You are about to cross the line. 
16078/1:This is it.  Don't push me any further.
16079/0:Oh God, what a nightmare.  This is gonna be my ass.
16079/1:No sign of the assassin.  Guess there's nothing I can do.
16079/2:Damn, the killer must've run off.
16080/0:You are about to cross the line. 
16080/1:This is it.  Don't push me any further.
16081/0:Jesus -- looks like he got away with it.  // disgust
16082/0:You are about to cross the line. 
16082/1:This is it.  Don't push me any further.
16083/0:Jesus -- looks like he got away with it.  // disgust
16084/0:Jesus -- looks like she got away with it.  // disgust
16085/0:Jesus -- looks like she got away with it.  // disgust
16086/0:Nothing.  The murderer gave us the slip.
16086/1:Lovely, the murderer's gone.
16087/0:Nothing.  The murderer gave us the slip.
16087/1:Lovely, the murderer's gone.
16088/0:You got out alive.  That's all that matters.
16089/0:Apparently the nanoformer isn't functional and you're the only one with the code to the repair bot storage closet.  If you give me the code, I'll take care of it.
16090/0:We are fortunate to live in an era such as this.
16091/0:How much do you charge your passengers?
16092/0:Her Holiness and Mr. Dumier are leaders of a secret society called the Illuminati.
16093/0:I am a prisoner!  In my own home!
16094/0:Don't let Tarsus's lies cloud your mind.  Look at Nassif's messages.  Then go to the Order headquarters in the old Hartford Turbine warehouse in Old Seattle.  It will all become clear to you.
16095/0:It's already taken care of.  QueeQueg's is going to have screaming kids lined up around the block.
16096/0:Her Holiness had the vision to start the movement, but Luminon Saman has the drive to complete it.
16097/0:My little analyzer has already transmitted the sequence back to my desk.
16098/0:You must be here for the Summit.
16099/0:I wouldn't mind paying more if I knew the money was going to the workers or to sustainable coffee plantations.
16100/0:Destruction -- that's easy.  But Her Holiness and Chairman Dumier think they can reunify the planet with a simple decree.
16101/0:We will watch you.
16102/0:I will be happy when SSC finally realizes they just need to run those Seekers out of town.
16103/0:Apparently the nanoformer isn't functional and you're the only one with the code to the repair bot storage closet.  If you give me the code, I'll take care of it.
16104/0:You are about to cross the line. 
16104/1:This is it.  Don't push me any further.
16105/0:I can't hit!
16105/1:Can't believe I missed!
16106/0:Right.  Carry on, Alex.
16107/0:You are about to cross the line. 
16107/1:This is it.  Don't push me any further.
16108/0:I can't hit!
16108/1:Can't believe I missed!
16109/0:Lucky for you, I've got a lot of patience.
16109/1:Glad you came to your senses before I had to teach you a lesson.
16110/0:I can't hit!
16110/1:Can't believe I missed!
16111/0:Lucky for you, I've got a lot of patience.
16111/1:Glad you came to your senses before I had to teach you a lesson.
16112/0:I can't hit!
16112/1:Can't believe I missed!
16113/0:Lucky for you, I've got a lot of patience.
16113/1:Glad you came to your senses before I had to teach you a lesson.
16114/0:I'm just getting warmed up.
16115/0:That was one lucky thief.
16115/1:Not much I can do at this point.  If it's gone, it's gone.
16116/0:Man, you think you know someone, then they start making a little money.
16117/0:
16118/0:Lucky for you, I've got a lot of patience.
16118/1:Glad you came to your senses before I had to teach you a lesson.
16119/0:I'm just getting warmed up.
16120/0:That was one lucky thief.
16120/1:Not much I can do at this point.  If it's gone, it's gone.
16121/0:Lucky for you, I have got a lot of patience.
16121/1:I am glad you came to your senses before I had to teach you a lesson.
16122/0:I'm just getting warmed up.
16123/0:Guess he won't be giving it back...
16124/0:Lucky for you, I've got a lot of patience.
16124/1:Glad you came to your senses before I had to teach you a lesson.
16125/0:I'm just getting warmed up.
16126/0:Guess he won't be giving it back...
16127/0:Lucky for you, I've got a lot of patience.
16127/1:Glad you came to your senses before I had to teach you a lesson.
16128/0:The next one will find it's mark.
16129/0:Guess she won't be giving it back...
16130/0:Lucky for you, I've got a lot of patience.
16130/1:Glad you came to your senses before I had to teach you a lesson.
16131/0:The next one will find it's mark.
16132/0:Guess she won't be giving it back...
16133/0:I have to admit, there has been some talk here of replacing SSC security guards with WTO military.  I expect there will be some fallout.  Just wanted to let you know that we have the situation in hand.
16134/0:I'd really like to tap into the overachiever market.  They're the ones that get hooked on the stuff.
16135/0:Forget it.  The thief's long gone.
16136/0:Forget it.  The thief's long gone.
16137/0:I don't believe that they've really resorted to dark, murderous rituals.
16138/0:Is someone there?
16138/1:Guess I better check this out.
16138/2:Could be trouble, I guess.
16138/3:Someone thinks they're real sneaky...
16139/0:Is someone there?
16139/1:Guess I better check this out.
16139/2:Could be trouble, I guess.
16139/3:Someone thinks they're real sneaky...
16139/4:I'll find out what this is.
16139/5:Better find out what's up.
16140/0:Resident not accepting visitors.
16141/0:Don't think you can get anything past me.  I'm still SSC, and I'm on duty.
16142/0:The damage was not caused by any sort of explosive or missile, but rather by an agent that seems to have dissolved the very substance of the buildings.
16143/0:The Mosque is a weapons-free zone.  To enter, you must submit to a deactivation procedure --  I'll transmit the encrypted safety-lock bytecodes to freeze all your weapons, in or on your person.  Upon your departure, sensors will reactivate everything you've got.
16144/0:(laugh)  You never know, I guess.
16145/0:Do I look like him?
16146/0:
16147/0:Sounds like you're in this for the adventure.
16148/0:Our sacred goal, the elevation of humankind, can only be accomplished in secrecy.
16149/0:Lucky for you, I've got a lot of patience.
16149/1:Glad you came to your senses before I had to teach you a lesson.
16150/0:The next one will find it's mark.
16151/0:Lucky for you, I've got a lot of patience.
16151/1:Glad you came to your senses before I had to teach you a lesson.
16152/0:The next one will find it's mark.
16153/0:Someone like NG Resonance probably wants to see a credit chit with a lot of bits in it.
16154/0:Lucky for you, I've got a lot of patience.
16154/1:Glad you came to your senses before I had to teach you a lesson.
16155/0:(grunt)
16155/1:(grunt)
16155/2:(grunt)
16156/0:Lucky for you, I've got a lot of patience.
16156/1:Glad you came to your senses before I had to teach you a lesson.
16157/0:(grunt)
16157/1:(grunt)
16157/2:(grunt)
16158/0:Be careful of the other trainees.  They won't necessarily see things the way you do.
16159/0:Just stick together.  We can handle this.
16160/0:(grunt)
16160/1:(grunt)
16160/2:(grunt)
16161/0:Hm.  Time to earn our keep.
16161/1:Let's take a look.
16162/0:Enough talk.  We both have work to do.
16163/0:We'll show YOU...
16164/0:(grunt)
16164/1:(grunt)
16164/2:(grunt)
16165/0:Hm.  Time to earn our keep.
16165/1:Let's take a look.
16166/0:Please listen with the rest of the Faithful.
16167/0:We can defend ourselves!
16168/0:I can't get a clear shot.
16168/1:I lost the target
16169/0:Just what I needed. 
16169/1:If somebody's there, I'd give myself up if I was you.
16169/2:Guess this is what they pay me for...
16169/3:... can't be too far...
16169/4:(gulp!) ...what was that?
16169/5:Guess it's too late to turn back now...
16169/6:Okay... I know something's there...
16169/7:Gotta see what's going on...
16170/0:We won't stand for this!
16171/0:I can't get a clear shot.
16171/1:I lost the target
16172/0:Just what I needed. 
16172/1:If somebody's there, I'd give myself up if I was you.
16172/2:Guess this is what they pay me for...
16172/3:... can't be too far...
16172/4:I'm sure I can handle this.
16172/5:Wait till I find you...
16172/6:Is somebody out there?
16172/7:What's going on?
16172/8:This better not be a practical joke.
16172/9:Hello?  No funny business now...
16173/0:Go outside to the abandoned VersaLife base.  I see that you have already turned on the pilot beacon.  I will be able to meet you there.
16174/0:I can't get a clear shot.
16174/1:I lost the target
16175/0:I think we're close.
16175/1:We'll find the thug.
16175/2:Not my favorite part of the job.
16176/0:We know how to handle ourselves...
16177/0:I can't get a clear shot.
16177/1:I lost the target
16178/0:I think we're close.
16178/1:We'll find the thug.
16178/2:Not my favorite part of the job.
16179/0:I can predict the future because I know the past.
16180/0:I saw that...
16180/1:Pretty sure I saw somebody...
16181/0:I saw that...
16181/1:Pretty sure I saw somebody...
16182/0:Luminon Saman's inflammatory rhetoric is widely believed to have caused the recent unrest in Trier, Germany.  But did adherents to an extreme brand of Order philosophy in Europe carry out a strike in the center of the American heartland?
16183/0:Not sure what I saw... getting a closer look.
16184/0:Not sure what I saw... getting a closer look.
16185/0:A playful reply.  You must be happy about something.
16186/0:That guy over there at the table said he admires your work as Minister of Culture.
16187/0:Blessed be... Blessed be...
16188/0:He's a great principal.  These kids are lucky.
16189/0:I'm still going to be careful.  Maybe they're just trying to trick us, then strike again when we're off guard.
16190/0:Let me take a moment to praise the Seattle delegates who attended our conference on establishing a World Congress.  Every day brings us closer to transitioning from city-states to nationhood.  Soon, citizens, we will live in the first world-wide democracy.
16191/0:
16192/0:When are people going to learn -- greasels aren't pets.
16193/0:We aren't afraid of YOU!
16194/0:Coward!
16194/1:Come back here!
16195/0:Don't blink, muchacho.
16196/0:Don't be afraid.  We can protect ourselves.
16197/0:Coward!
16197/1:Come back here!
16198/0:Don't think we can't fight!
16199/0:Coward!
16199/1:Come back here!
16200/0:Make sure they bring a mop.
16201/0:I can handle this...  Just back me up, all right?
16202/0:Coward!
16202/1:Come back here!
16203/0:We aren't backing down!
16204/0:Ha!  You missed!
16205/0:Pretty sure I heard something...
16205/1:Just one more squeak, little mouse...
16206/0:Got it.
16207/0:Together we can handle this...
16208/0:Ha!  You missed!
16209/0:Pretty sure I heard something...
16209/1:Just one more squeak, little mouse...
16210/0:I bet you don't even have an arcology pass.
16211/0:I'm on my way for help.
16212/0:Ha!  You missed!
16213/0:Gonna go find out what that noise was.
16214/0:The Plan finally unfolds.
16215/0:I'm on my way for help.
16216/0:Ha!  You missed!
16217/0:Gonna go find out what that noise was.
16218/0:We will bring you more details on these events as they become available.
16219/0:
16219/1:
16219/2:
16219/3:
16220/0:I'm on my way for help.
16221/0:Looking good, looking good...
16222/0:Oh no... trouble!
16222/1:Jeez!
16222/2:Oh my god... // scared, anxious
16222/3:(gasp) I better do something!
16223/0:How 'bout you distract the terrorist while I sneak by?
16224/0:I'm on my way for help.
16225/0:Looking good, looking good...
16226/0:Oh no... trouble!
16226/1:Jeez!
16226/2:Oh my god...
16226/3:(gasp) I better do something!
16226/4:I know you're there!
16226/5:SSC on duty -- you're in trouble now.
16227/0:I see you!
16228/0:I see you!
16229/0:Hey, you!
16229/1:I think you just got caught.
16230/0:Hey, you!
16230/1:I think you just got caught.
16231/0:Well done in the arcology.  You have my gratitude.
16232/0:What a big nothing the Order turned out to be.  They redecorated the mosque.  What else?  I wanted to believe, but what sort of order is this?  Perpetual killing.  Gang warfare.  Just like before they came.
16233/0:I trust you to do what's best for everyone.
16234/0:The Age of Light is at hand.  How lucky you are to have Mr. Dumier's favor.
16235/0:Find your way home.
16236/0:Piece of cake.
16237/0:Evidence of hostility will be met with force.
16238/0:
16239/0:Just open the door when you're ready.  The safety-locks will be removed when you pass through the exit.
16240/0:
16241/0:Of course Purity will prevail.  We are the righteous.
16242/0:Mina, huh?  I saw her name in the school's recruitment database.  I moved her to the "accepted" category.
16243/0:Welcome to Pequod's, coffee for the stars.
16244/0:I'm on my way for help.
16245/0:Looking good, looking good...
16246/0:I'm on my way for help.
16247/0:Looking good, looking good...
16248/0:Is there a problem?
16249/0:I'm not answering any questions until you tell me who YOU are.
16250/0:And that's why you almost killed Her Holiness, the spiritual leader of half the world?
16251/0:I'm on my way for help.
16252/0:Looks like an even match here.
16253/0:I'm on my way for help.
16254/0:Looks like an even match here.
16255/0:I'm on my way for help.
16256/0:Looks like an even match here.
16257/0:Good.  The Age of Light is upon us.
16258/0:You do this, Red, you better make it quick and hide the body.
16259/0:
16260/0:I'm on my way for help.
16261/0:Looks like an even match here.
16262/0:The Order is spiritually rich, but that doesn't buy many private jets.  Finish the job at Sophia Sak's landing pad, or go to the Greasel Pit bar.  You shouldn't have any trouble finding a pilot there.
16263/0:I'm on my way for help.
16264/0:This is hopeless!
16265/0:Hold on -- no room.
16266/0:I'm on my way for help.
16267/0:This is hopeless!
16268/0:Suits me just fine.  You don't get anywhere in this outfit without combat experience.
16269/0:That's enough.  I'm leaving.
16269/1:Oh no... this can't be happening...
16269/2:No more fighting!  No...!
16269/3:Help!  Help!  Help!
16270/0:This is hopeless!
16271/0:I'm sorry -- I can't help you.  I've been reassigned.
16272/0:Then maybe they failed and were dismissed?
16273/0:That's enough.  I'm leaving.
16273/1:Oh no!  Oh no!  Not me!
16273/2:What did I do?  What?!
16273/3:I'm leaving... I'm leaving now!
16274/0:This is hopeless!
16275/0:I'll think about it.
16276/0:Talk to me.
16277/0:Carry on.
16278/0:Alex, no luck finding an exit.  Why are we locked in?  And why aren't the other trainees asking questions?  Maybe they're in on it... whatever IT is.  I don't like this, Alex.  They whisk us out of bed, bring us here in the middle of the night, and... Hold on.  I hear someone.  Come see me as soon as you get this.
16279/0:You're late.  Mr. O'Rourke will want an explanation.
16280/0:They will eventually murder him.  You can't let all our hard work be destroyed by these lunatics.  On some instinctual level, you feel a basic kinship -- you know there's bond.  Please, Alex -- save Paul.
16281/0:Are you sure you've got the right person?
16282/0:This is a weird school, using transgenics for class.
16283/0:I coulda got killed...
16284/0:I'm trying to stay focused here.
16285/0:Yeah, she's really hot, but she's fun to talk to, too.
16286/0:That's enough.  I'm leaving.
16287/0:Here we go...
16288/0:That's enough.  I'm leaving.
16289/0:Here we go...
16290/0:That is enough.  I am leaving.
16291/0:Here we go...
16292/0:That's enough.  I'm leaving.
16293/0:Here we go...
16294/0:There's no way Sak's making this kind of money honestly.  I bet she's a smuggler.  And not only are the authorities looking the other way, we're working for her.
16295/0:That's enough.  I'm leaving.
16296/0:You don't know when to quit.
16297/0:That's enough.  I'm leaving.
16298/0:You don't know when to quit.
16299/0:Go on.  You've got my attention.
16300/0:That's enough.  I'm leaving.
16300/1:I'm outta here...
16300/2:I didn't have anything to do with it!
16300/3:Whoa - don't hurt me.
16301/0:You don't know when to quit.
16302/0:That's enough.  I'm leaving.
16302/1:O-kay... time to go...
16302/2:I'll get out of here!  Just don't hurt me!
16302/3:I -- I give up!
16303/0:You don't know when to quit.
16304/0:That's enough.  I'm leaving.
16305/0:No problem -- I can deal with this.
16306/0:Today marks the one year anniversary of the Refinery Riots, protesting the incorporation of Seattle into the WTO.  Mourners held a candlelight vigil in remembrance of those killed in the chaos.
16307/0:That's enough.  I'm leaving.
16307/1:Oh no...!
16307/2:This isn't my problem!
16307/3:Gotta get out of here...
16308/0:No problem -- I can deal with this.
16309/0:Thanks again.  That's twice now you have saved me from the Templars.
16310/0:
16311/0:
16312/0:Endorsements for a particular brand of coffee.
16313/0:It's the only one.  Alex -- I understand you're under pressure from the WTO, but you don't have to become their puppet.  Get to JC and do what you can to finish this project.  If you do that, it won't matter who controls this research because the fruits of all this work will be available to everyone.
16314/0:Hi.  I'm NG Resonance.  What would you like to talk about?
16315/0:All governments have power.  The benefit of giving this power to a synthetic intellect is that human affairs would no longer need to be ruled by generalities.  Helios will have a deep understanding of every person's life and opinions.
16316/0:Soon you will join the ranks of the Illuminati's select leaders.
16317/0:You just have to live one day at a time.
16318/0:You were kind to us once, though not to JC.  If you leave us in peace, we will not harm you.
16319/0:He was a bad man.  Any enemy of his is a friend of mine.
16320/0:Serious.  Back off.
16321/0:Yes -- this is the Cairo branch of your old alma-mater.  No need to investigate further.  You already know the location of the secret ApstleCorp facility.
16322/0:Did you hear about this Code Yellow? 
16323/0:Amid the safe...  Amid the predictable...  Amid the sleepy and the sheltered, one place stands apart.
16324/0:Looks like people from Tarsus are mixed up in that transaction.  I'd like to know why they're running equipment to Mako Ballistics -- and why a weapon called the Mag Rail has been commissioned by the Knights Templar..  Find a pilot and get to the Mako campus at once.
16325/0:When the spit starts flyin', a gob's gotta stay tuned in to the coach.  That's what happened.  Bug got scared and quit takin' my commands.
16326/0:A sympathetic ear, for now.  Believe me, child of the City of Destruction, the last days of humankind may be at hand.  Help me when I call on you, and I will have no need to destroy more cities.  Only one ApostleCorp facility remains, and I simply need the device JC Denton has assembled there...
16327/0:No problem -- I can deal with this.
16328/0:How did that get open?
16329/0:No problem -- I can deal with this.
16330/0:How did that get open?
16331/0:Gotcha!
16331/1:One more like that...
16332/0:That should be open.
16333/0:Gotcha!
16333/1:One more like that...
16334/0:That should be open.
16335/0:Gotcha!
16335/1:One more like that...
16336/0:That should be open.
16337/0:Gotcha!
16337/1:One more like that...
16338/0:It's on?  That's strange.
16339/0:I guess I did the right thing...
16339/1:Oh God -- what have I done?
16340/0:It's on?  That's strange.
16341/0:I have decided.  I will be one of these missionaries.
16342/0:Whatever they say, this ain't cruelty.  This right here, starvin' these gobs and makin' 'em go at it, this is justice.
16343/0:I guess I did the right thing...
16343/1:Oh God -- what have I done?
16344/0:It's on?  That's strange.
16345/0:I guess I did the right thing...
16345/1:Oh God -- what have I done?
16346/0:Who turned this off?
16347/0:I guess I did the right thing...
16347/1:Oh God -- what have I done?
16348/0:Who turned this off?
16349/0:I'll take that chopper from downstairs -- if you don't mind.
16350/0:Can I help you?
16351/0:Convergence is possible, my seekers.  The Chairman and I have outlined a program to bring our systems into agreement.  Poverty is not a prerequisite for fulfillment, nor is amorality a prerequisite for prosperity.  Together, in peace.  This is the way.
16352/0:I'll be waitin'.
16353/0:I wonder how long the Omar will need the human race.
16354/0:Any ideas how this got damaged?
16355/0:Who sent you?  It was that Pequod's jerk, wasn't it?  He isn't satisfied that he already has the zoning locked down for all of Upper Seattle and can keep me out.  He has to play like a mafia don and send people to harass me.  Well, I won't be intimidated!  I won't!
16356/0:Any ideas how this got damaged?
16357/0:Any ideas about those malfunctions?
16358/0:What the hell are you doing?  You were supposed to get him to safety, not murder him.
16359/0:Any ideas about those malfunctions?
16360/0:Maybe we should leave.
16361/0:Any ideas about those malfunctions?
16362/0:Do you know how this got disabled?
16363/0:Do you know how this got disabled?
16364/0:Do you know how this got disabled?
16365/0:Something's definitely up.  I'd search that area.
16365/1:It looks like something's going on.
16365/2:I think you should take a look over there.
16366/0:What do you think you're doing?!
16367/0:Something's definitely up.  I'd search that area.
16367/1:It looks like something's going on.
16367/2:I think you should take a look over there.
16368/0:The Omar appreciate your business.
16369/0:You better not be backing out.
16370/0:You've shown appalling judgement, Alex.  I share your loathing of the Nassifs, but you've become a threat to a community protected by the Church.  If you won't work with us, I suppose I will have to send in a task force to destroy you.
16371/0:You owe it to them--and to the world--to find out.
16372/0:If you want to pay me back, maybe you could find a pilot to take you to the Statue of Liberty in New York.
16373/0:
16374/0:So you're a part of Versalife?  I thought that corporation folded during the Collapse.  Quite a few people believe they actually caused it, in fact.
16375/0:We've got an injury over here.
16376/0:Who turned this off?
16377/0:You KNOW?  But -- he told me not to tell you.  What's going on?
16378/0:We've got an injury over here.
16379/0:We've got an injury over here.
16380/0:We've got an injury over here.
16381/0:You killed them!
16382/0:Why's this blocked off?
16383/0:You killed them!
16384/0:Why's this blocked off?
16385/0:You killed them!
16386/0:Why's this blocked off?
16387/0:If only we could release the repair bot... or get to the controls for the hazard flush system.  Too bad no one has the equipment to make it over there.
16388/0:You killed them!
16389/0:I've got to get this door open.
16390/0:So you're just going to cede this territory?
16391/0:Hey, you're getting the hang of that!
16392/0:I've got to get this door open.
16393/0:Wait -- I've got to make room.
16394/0:Hey, you're getting the hang of that!
16395/0:I've got to get this door open.
16396/0:Inadequate funds.
16397/0:Hold on -- I can't carry anything else right now.
16398/0:Please!  Open the door!
16399/0:Something's definitely up.  I'd search that area.
16399/1:It looks like something's going on.
16399/2:I think you should take a look over there.
16400/0:It was some guy -- he went that way.
16400/1:This guy came through, heading that way.
16401/0:Well, at the Strand Institute --
16402/0:It was some guy -- he went that way.
16402/1:This guy came through, heading that way.
16403/0:I guess you're right.  Through this door, take the hallway to the elevator at the other end.  It's busted, so you'll have to climb the ladder in the shaft to the top floor.  Miss Sak's office is up there.  And remember:  stay off the landing pad.
16404/0:It was some guy -- he went that way.
16404/1:This guy came through, heading that way.
16405/0:It was some chick -- She went that way.
16405/1:This woman came through, heading that way.
16406/0:It was some chick -- She went that way.
16406/1:This woman came through, heading that way.
16407/0:It was some chick -- She went that way.
16407/1:This woman came through, heading that way.
16408/0:
16408/1:
16408/2:
16409/0:I think I saw someone who was up to no good.  Over there.
16409/1:I might've seen the person responsible.  Check around over there.
16410/0:I think I saw someone who was up to no good.  Over there.
16410/1:I might've seen the person responsible.  Check around over there.
16411/0:I think I saw someone who was up to no good.  Over there.
16411/1:I might've seen the person responsible.  Check around over there.
16412/0:Stand back -- SSC on duty.
16413/0:Is it freedom when one child is born to poverty, a chance combination of organic materials, while the wealthy child is shaped every day of his life, enhanced genetically, trained, educated, often augmented nanotechnologically?
16414/0:I hope he's okay.
16415/0:I took care of that lawyer, Kevin O'Rourke.  He won't be bothering your customers anymore.
16416/0:Hey, you're getting the hang of that!
16417/0:(grunt) You're not going to stop me that easily.
16418/0:Hey, you're getting the hang of that!
16419/0:(grunt) You're not going to stop me that easily.
16420/0:Guess you're cracking out of luck, then.
16421/0:What's this all about?
16422/0:Glad you took care of that.
16423/0:(grunt) You're not going to stop me that easily.
16424/0:Glad you took care of that.
16425/0:Forget it, that's too dangerous.
16426/0:Maybe later.
16427/0:Glad you took care of that.
16428/0:Forget it, that's too dangerous.
16429/0:What do the Templars want?  World domination?
16430/0:Glad you took care of that.
16431/0:Forget it, that's too dangerous.
16432/0:You're running?!
16433/0:You never see the seekers getting sick, do you?  I wonder if they invented the plague to drive people to desperation.
16434/0:You're running?!
16435/0:You know this for certain?  I should stay in position -- how long?
16436/0:You're running?!
16437/0:You're running?!
16438/0:Hold still... 
16438/1:Just about gotcha...
16439/0:Actually, I feel a little guilty when I think about all the people still living in post-Collapse shanties.  My family's from Lower Seattle.
16440/0:I checked out the public terminal.  Looks like we got out of Chicago just in time.
16441/0:People should realize -- the more trouble they cause, the longer it's going to take the WTO system to spread out to the rest of society.
16442/0:There's nothing in the WTO charter against religion.  No reason you can't believe in Her Holiness and still hold down a decent job.
16443/0:
16444/0:Ha-ha...!  Red sure run a drag on THAT uptown feeb...
16445/0:I heard some strange noises coming from over that way.
16446/0:I heard some strange noises coming from over that way.
16447/0:He's been hit pretty hard.  Mr. Kurczec wasn't the only one who was killed.
16448/0:
16449/0:I heard some strange noises coming from over that way.
16450/0:Some guy attacked me then ran off in that direction.
16451/0:Stakin' out your turf, huh?  Understood, compadre.  Where to?
16452/0:The WTO appreciates the help of conscientious citizens.
16453/0:Now I can expand into Lower Seattle without worrying too much about price-point.
16454/0:Some guy attacked me then ran off in that direction.
16455/0:Some guy attacked me then ran off in that direction.
16456/0:Now we've got two of you freaks working for us.  The opposition is falling apart.
16457/0:They were in the way.
16458/0:Some lady attacked me then ran off in that direction.
16459/0:Better late than never.  I'm glad to see you snapped out of the Templars' spell.
16460/0:Some lady attacked me then ran off in that direction.
16461/0:Some lady attacked me then ran off in that direction.
16462/0:I'd look around over there.
16462/1:Check out that area.
16463/0:That's what they get for using a so-called "specialist..."
16464/0:Well, first of all, she wasn't young.  Hey, NG, I have a question.
16465/0:We don't want simple mercenaries.  We want brothers who withhold their tissues from WTO entrepreneurs, who likewise affirm that the Order Church's doctrine of self-improvement cleverly implies modification, materialism, everything that the church's founders abhorred.
16466/0:The rioting is not going to solve anything. 
16467/0:Vitakka... vitakka... vitakka....
16468/0:Ma'am, that's close enough.  Do not approach the checkpoint.
16469/0:This school was once an ApostleCorp operation.  The Knights Templar must have penetrated their organization some time ago.  I need you to investigate the secret ApostleCorp suite that the Templars discovered.  Your objective will be to locate Dr. Nassif and interrogate her.
16470/0:Hold still... 
16470/1:Just about gotcha...
16471/0:We've declared open war.  Today the Templars avenge themselves against Philip the Fair, who drove us underground nearly eight centuries ago.  Is it so difficult to understand?
16472/0:You won't get away with this!
16472/1:(laugh) Revenge..!
16473/0:Hold still... 
16473/1:Just about gotcha...
16474/0:Campus-wide policy remains in effect -- no visitors.
16475/0:I will be waiting for you here at Liberty Island.  JC Denton seems to be constructing some sort of Statue -- a tribute to Machinery, it appears.  We choose Liberty, Alex, which is the preservation of humanity not just from legal machinery but from all forms of machinery.
16476/0:The guards are just SSC grunts.  They have pretty jumpy fingers where strangers are concerned.
16477/0:Help!
16478/0:That's good to hear.
16479/0:Help!
16480/0:I'm sending in a bot.
16481/0:... just a show for the media.
16482/0:Help!
16483/0:I'm sending in a bot.
16484/0:Help!
16485/0:I'm sending in a bot.
16486/0:We hope for new peace, less silence.
16487/0:Right away.
16487/1:I'm on my way.
16488/0:I'm calling for a bot.
16489/0:Right away.
16489/1:I'm on my way.
16490/0:I'm calling for a bot.
16491/0:I am not a Seeker, but I hope she does not get hurt.  Who knows what would happen then?
16492/0:Like you said, I talk to everyone.  If you learn what goes on there, please inform me.
16493/0:I'd look around over there.
16493/1:Check out that area.
16494/0:Here you go.  Name's Alex D.  [100 credits.]
16495/0:I'd look around over there.
16495/1:Check out that area.
16496/0:I felt something.  I'd investigate that area.
16497/0:I felt something.  I'd investigate that area.
16498/0:I felt something.  I'd investigate that area.
16499/0:Nope.
16499/1:Sorry, I have no idea.
16500/0:So?
16501/0:Nope.
16501/1:Sorry, I have no idea.
16502/0:Nope.
16502/1:Sorry, I have no idea.
16503/0:Greetings.
16503/1:Good day.
16503/2:Hello.
16504/0:Greetings.
16504/1:Good day.
16504/2:Hello.
16505/0:I know --  it's overwhelming.  I've dedicated myself to the WTO, only to find out it's just a myth they created. 
16506/0:Okay.  You're clear to enter.
16507/0:Why was he frozen?
16508/0:How'd you know that I just trashed QueeQueg's?
16509/0:So much hate here.  And fear.
16510/0:Right away.
16510/1:I'm on my way.
16511/0:I have something I need to take care of first.
16512/0:Right away.
16512/1:I'm on my way.
16513/0:For instance, what if this new members-only club -- the Knights Templar -- what if they are a fiction?  What if Chairman Dumier and one of his old drinking buddies concocted the idea as a way to distract people?
16514/0:Ummm... Let's talk about this when there's no one around.
16515/0:Ummm... Let's talk about this when there's no one around.
16516/0:Ummm... Let's talk about this when there's no one around.
16517/0:Ummm... Let's talk about this when there's no one around.
16518/0:Interesting.
16519/0:...I wonder...
16519/1:I think I might be coming down with something.
16520/0:...I wonder...
16521/0:...I wonder...
16521/1:I think I might be coming down with something.
16521/2:I'll have to make the credits count...
16521/3:Never any fresh vegetables...
16521/4:What a world to bring a child into.
16521/5:I wish I could afford to have it mended.
16521/6:At least the water has cleared up...
16521/7:Perhaps I should volunteer at the church.
16521/8:Look how far we've regressed.
16522/0:The SSC Executive Commander and Chairman Dumier are here.  I never thought I'd meet both of them.
16523/0:Let's stay friends.
16524/0:We're talking about the rioting in Trier.  Order religious fanatics inciting workers to destroy the lawful property of the Panzerworks factory.
16525/0:Greetings.
16525/1:Good day.
16525/2:Hello.
16526/0:Hail Templar!
16526/1:Purity in heart, mind, and body.
16527/0:Hail Templar!
16527/1:Purity in heart, mind, and body.
16528/0:You think there's a political agenda -- behind my biomods?
16529/0:Hail Templar!
16529/1:Purity in heart, mind, and body.
16530/0:Greetings.
16530/1:Good day.
16530/2:Well met.
16531/0:Good work.  You found the financial data that the enclave's Civic Manager is interested in -- evidence of tax evasion, I bet.  I'm sure that he would be happy to give you a Citizen's Bonus if you reported the information to him at the WTO Air Terminal.
16532/0:Greetings.
16532/1:Good day.
16532/2:Well met.
16533/0:I notified the authorities.  SSC will take care of things.
16534/0:Greetings.
16534/1:Good day.
16534/2:Well met.
16535/0:Once again Minister Finley, we'd like to extend an invitation for you to join one of the WTO's Elite Committees, with all the privileges and clearance.  The WTO thinks very highly of your work and would like to facilitate the mission of the History of Nanotechnology, in particular, in any way that we can.
16536/0:
16537/0:Hail Templar!
16537/1:Purity in heart, mind, and body.
16538/0:Hail Templar!
16538/1:Purity in heart, mind, and body.
16539/0:Hail Templar!
16539/1:Purity in heart, mind, and body.
16540/0:A remarkable achievement.  You do not even comprehend today's significance for the future of this planet, or whose interests you may have served, but you have our gratitude.  A discount will be applied to all of your business transactions with our agents, anywhere in the world.
16541/0:How precious.  Why couldn't you waltz into my life sooner?
16542/0:Actually, I'm looking for work.
16543/0:Guess you're lookin' to get paid.
16544/0:So?
16545/0:I'd really like to see it.
16546/0:Don -- have you seen the latest ballistics on Project Xenos?  We finally did it!  Now we've just got to fix that bug in the threat assessment firmware.
16547/0:By the way, Miss Klara Sparks is now dead.
16548/0:No one's getting past me...
16548/1:This scab's in big trouble!
16549/0:Thank you.  Thank you again.
16550/0:How do you expect me to steal a biomod?  Kill him and bring you the body?
16551/0:The WTO?  Chief Morgan seems pretty intent on recruiting us.
16552/0:Another day breathing this self-replicating crud, and I'd be dead anyway.
16553/0:Helios is simply the natural evolution of consciousness.  The AI and I agree on how best to use each other's abilities.
16554/0:Your notions of privacy are old-fashioned.  It was a love of privacy that brought on the Collapse.  A love of secrets, plans, and personal possessions.
16555/0:Just a simple analogy.  My enemies seek to establish States, but they forget to heed Plato's good advice: do not fail to convince the children that the gods are incapable of lying.
16556/0:We get good prices now that the Omar moved in.
16557/0:How much longer?
16557/1:What are they thinking?
16558/0:Lovely.  I already scouted the area.  Get ready for a tight squeeze on the ground.
16559/0:How much longer?
16559/1:What are they thinking?
16560/0:(laugh) I think you better get out of here before one of these fanatics puts a red hood on your head.
16561/0:How much longer?
16561/1:What are they thinking?
16562/0:I came here hoping to relax.
16563/0:I don't know.
16563/1:I can't imagine.
16564/0:Your cavalier attitude toward human life is disgusting...  Nonetheless you got the info we needed from Nassif in Cairo.  For that, I'm giving you this extra biomod canister so that you might be a more effective operative.  Try to use it more wisely than you've been using your current resources.
16565/0:I don't know.
16565/1:I can't imagine.
16566/0:Yes, young Pliable.  Dr. Todd is waiting for you in the flight bay.  Do as he asks.  As long as you cooperate, my paladins will hold their fire.  I will have additional instructions for you when you reach Liberty Island.
16567/0:I don't know.
16567/1:I can't imagine.
16568/0:How's that for first-class?  New Cairo arcology, Flight Bay 23... Eye of the Pyramid.  I even set you up with a pass for entering and leaving the arcology.
16569/0:Safeness again.
16570/0:Nobody tells us anything.
16570/1:This is just ridiculous.
16571/0:Afraid I'm trolling for bigger fish, Buck.
16572/0:Nobody tells us anything.
16572/1:This is just ridiculous.
16573/0:Nobody tells us anything.
16573/1:This is just ridiculous.
16574/0:We're lucky we tapped into city power a few years ago, or else this place would be unlivable.
16575/0:I hear ya!
16575/1:I feel your pain!
16576/0:I can't carry anything else right now -- hold on.
16577/0:The damage was not caused by any sort of explosive or missile, but rather by an agent that seems to have dissolved the very substance of the buildings.
16578/0:The Seattle Tarsus Intermediate facility was raided, with numerous casualties.  The extent of the damage is not yet known.
16579/0:I'm carrying too much.  I've got to drop something first.
16580/0:Cindy... Lovely girl.  Kind of a faffer to live with, though.
16581/0:Too late.  They left already.  I guess we can watch the news to hear what they talked about.
16582/0:
16583/0:
16584/0:You sure you're going to stay and fight?
16585/0:I hear ya!
16585/1:I feel your pain!
16586/0:I believe we have a friend in common...
16587/0:
16588/0:I hear ya!
16588/1:I feel your pain!
16589/0:Security Chief Morgan dispatched me to this location to find Dr. Nassif for questioning.  
16590/0:I hope you can, Alex.  I sincerely hope you can.
16591/0:Thank you for protecting the environment.
16591/1:Recyclable item.  Dispensing appropriate payment.
16591/2:Material recovered.  Your community is grateful.
16592/0:An acceptable exchange.
16593/0:Item not recyclable.
16593/1:Unable to recover material from item.
16593/2:Recyclables only, please.
16594/0:I can manage.
16595/0:Ha-hah!  We did it!  Snake-eyes BURIED that fool greasel!
16596/0:Admirable donation.  You are a good, conscientious citizen.  Please encourage your friends to behave likewise.
16596/1:Error corrected.  Please forgive this unit's underpayment.
16596/2:Rare metals recovered from item.  The community commends your generosity.
16596/3:Complex nanoscale components salvaged from item.  Dispensing bonus.
16597/0:Temporarily offline.  Please locate the nearest recycling unit.
16598/0:You may as well head out.  The club will be closing for a while.
16599/0:Unit damaged.  Repair-bot maintenance required.
16600/0:You know I can't.
16601/0:Access denied.
16602/0:Are you sure he was going to murder the children?
16603/0:Systems (garble garble) error (garble) signal loss (garble)...
16604/0:Get out of here, you freak.
16605/0:
16606/0:Her Holiness wants to help ALL humankind.
16607/0:Did he give you any trouble, Chris?
16608/0:Upon the arrival of the key, JC was to be awakened, to welcome the perfected genetic code.  Then he and Paul were to share it with the world. Now, there is much unexpected violence, but we will proceed according to the original Plan. 
16609/0:I'm not sayin' it twice.
16610/0:
16611/0:It doesn't sound so hard to write novels.  I could figure it out if I had the time.
16612/0:NG Resonance is playing a concert in the arcology tomorrow.  I need someone to convince her to endorse QueeQueg's.  From what I hear, her manager, Miss Withers, can easily be bribed.  Try to catch her waiting for NG and offer her some money.  If she accepts, I will compensate you with a choice of several weapon mods, which I found on a dead Omar.
16613/0:I'm worried about the terrorists.  I hope they can't get into the arcology.
16614/0:Next one's the World Championship.  Betting starts ten minutes before the fight.
16615/0:I am grateful for your forebearance, after I failed to kill the test subjects and Dr. Nassif.
16616/0:I'm already carrying too much.
16617/0:Please deposit your waste items.
16617/1:Complete the cycle.  Recycle.
16617/2:Do not litter.  Your community depends upon individual responsibility.
16618/0:Huh?
16618/1:What?
16618/2:Er?
16619/0:This has been a pleasing transaction.
16620/0:How peculiar...
16620/1:Hmmmm...
16620/2:That seems odd.
16621/0:Sometimes I wonder why I should care what happens to me anymore, after what they did to my daughter Eeva at that school.
16622/0:This is growing more and more suspicious.
16622/1:Again?
16622/2:What's this?  More?
16623/0:Close to what?
16624/0:What was that?
16624/1:I wonder...
16625/0:Yeah.
16626/0:What's going on? 
16626/1:What's this about?
16627/0:You cannot fool me.
16627/1:You should be more careful.
16628/0:Fantastic.  Here's a few credits for your trouble.
16629/0:I know you're here now.
16629/1:You've got my attention now.
16630/0:Yes.  Tomorrow evening.  You're gonna come, right?  Come on, it'll be fun!
16631/0:You've made a mistake... You'd best not make another.
16631/1:So you want to play...
16632/0:Gah!
16632/1:What the...?!
16632/2:Whoa!
16633/0:Exactly.  But I don't think they were involved with Chicago.  They're a worldwide organization, not a band of terrorists.
16634/0:Before the... disruptions, Helios and I had many months of productive thought.  Up to now, all free societies have started with one premise: human nature is cruel, unjust -- a force to be controlled.
16635/0:Her Holiness fears we will take society through its next Prigigonic leap.  But she would accept our work over time.
16636/0:Neutralization of the ApostleCorp and Templar threats is at hand.
16637/0:While no concrete research has been done, many suspect that breathing these particles causes a higher incidence of certain chronic diseases.
16638/0:I thought you said you were done.
16639/0:I take it you heard the "disturbance."
16640/0:Have you ever considered what is unique about post-Collapse society?  Hmmm?  Trans-territoriality.  Most political entities coexist on a global scale.  The WTO has its enclaves, we have our settlements and churches.
16641/0:Contact me from this beacon when you're ready to leave.
16642/0:
16643/0:Guess Trier's the party town right now -- globablization secret meetings, riots, good beer...  Catch you at the terminal, eh?
16644/0:SSC couldn't find a riot prod in a Horde lab.  
16645/0:When I find out who authorized this transport in the first place....
16646/0:They allow too much Inclinator traffic with Lower Seattle.  That's how these things happen.
16647/0:Nothing.
16647/1:Nevermind.
16647/2:I need to stay focused.
16648/0:We'll meet again, Alex.
16648/1:I'm going to finish this the next time, Alex.
16648/2:You may have gotten away this time, Alex, but this is far from over.
16649/0:What are you doing here?
16650/0:The coward must've ran...
16650/1:I'm glad that little pest has moved on...
16650/2:Until we meet next...
16651/0:I think I saw something.
16651/1:Unless my eyes deceive me...
16651/2:That doesn't look right...
16652/0:I know I saw someone.
16652/1:Now I see you. 
16653/0:Lots of bouncers in here.  Are they really necessary?
16654/0:That noise...
16654/1:That sounds like...
16655/0:I just felt something.
16656/0:I wouldn't make it far without the missiles disabled.
16657/0:What just hit me?!
16658/0:What is THAT?
16658/1:Whoa!
16658/2:Oh great -- now what?
16659/0:... blood...
16659/1:Someone's been injured...
16660/0:You have a generous heart.  You would make a good Seeker, but Order has many enemies, and often appeasement only prolongs a problem.  You can find Sid Black at the Greasel Pit bar if you want to give him the good news about his jet.
16661/0:I think I changed my mind about that other code.
16662/0:What makes you think this job isn't on the up and up?
16663/0:She has signed her soul over to the Luddites, the haters of technology.  Protect JC, or she could plunge the world into another Dark Age.  Trust me -- I was like her twenty years ago... and I still share some of the blame for triggering the Collapse.
16664/0:I don't have enough cash to make a reasonable offer.  [500 credits.]
16665/0:Shall we conduct business, or shall we wait until you examine the mutant?
16666/0:Hang on there, honey.
16667/0:I heard she turned it on.
16668/0:The medina needs a dating service, the whole Nanite Swell 11 region.
16669/0:That blasted thing is in my path!
16669/1:It's in the way!
16670/0:That blasted thing is in my path!
16670/1:It's in the way!
16671/0:... in the shadows...
16672/0:That blasted thing is in my path!
16672/1:It's in the way!
16673/0:This door... won't open!
16673/1:Is it locked?  Is it jammed?  Gah!
16674/0:Hmmm... fire.
16675/0:This door... won't open!
16675/1:Is it locked?  Is it jammed?  Gah!
16676/0:All this smoke...
16677/0:This door... won't open!
16677/1:Is it locked?  Is it jammed?  Gah!
16678/0:This area's seen some action recently.
16678/1:Someone has pretty poor aim.
16679/0:This may slow me down... but it won't stop me.
16679/1:(grunt) I'll get through.
16680/0:Uh... do I know you?
16681/0:You were a good operative, Alex.  I hate to watch you go bad.
16682/0:... a transgenic corpse...
16682/1:Someone took care of THIS freak.  Heh.
16683/0:This may slow me down... but it won't stop me.
16683/1:(grunt) I'll get through.
16684/0:The animals are obviously onto something...
16684/1:The animals must sense someone...
16685/0:A greasel don't grow up wild and not get in fights.  I said this gob is FRESH, understand?  Been huntin' scab winos for years.
16686/0:That cat sure is agitated....
16687/0:That rat seems like it's been spooked.
16688/0:Your followers haven't expelled you yet?
16689/0:The pigeons are stirred up.
16690/0:So.  You want to hammer us back into the Dark Ages?  Don't think I'm going to ignore a threat to the world I brought back from ashes.  I'm sending in some commandos.  If somehow you survive, more will be waiting for you on Liberty Island -- and so will I!
16691/0:I don't think so.
16692/0:These kids probably have no idea how good they've got it.
16693/0:No one's allowed past this point without the proper softkey ID.
16694/0:Great -- that means we're the buffer.
16695/0:A secret entrance -- to the cathedral?
16696/0:My cousin said he saw NG partying here once. Whatever.
16697/0:Huh?
16697/1:Hello?
16697/2:Maybe something's up?
16698/0:
16699/0:Right.  Those are the orders.  Let Alex Denton pass.  Apparently on our side now.
16700/0:This may slow me down... but it won't stop me.
16700/1:(grunt) I'll get through.
16701/0:Me?  (grunt)  Protection.
16702/0:I can't go in THERE.
16702/1:No way... that's too dangerous...
16703/0:I can't go in THERE.
16703/1:No way... that's too dangerous...
16704/0:Didn't Commander Maxwell give you a key to the gate in the courtyard?  Oh well -- if you'd rather fight your way through a greasel nest, I guess I can't stop you.
16705/0:
16706/0:I can't go in THERE.
16706/1:No way... that's too dangerous...
16707/0:Another lucky night...
16708/0:Baphomet guide me into battle.
16708/1:I will be victorious.
16708/2:You will be destroyed.
16708/3:Toward Purity!
16708/4:To a valiant end.
16708/5:Welcome to your last moments.
16708/6:Soon the lights will go out.
16708/7:Finally.
16708/8:Engaging target.
16708/9:Finally some action.
16708/10:This is for the cause.
16708/11:You should've run.
16709/0:Guide me, Baphomet.
16709/1:Victory awaits.
16709/2:Finally, battle.
16709/3:Prepare to meet your end.
16709/4:You're no match for a Paladin.
16709/5:To battle!
16709/6:For Purity!
16709/7:No prisoners!
16709/8:To the death!
16709/9:You'll fall before me!
16709/10:I'm on it.
16709/11:This one's mine!
16709/12:Rock and roll!
16709/13:YEAH, this is gonna be clean...
16710/0:Don't DO this, Alex!  
16711/0:
16712/0:Baphomet grant me power.
16712/1:Back!
16712/2:It ends here!
16712/3:Toward Purity!
16712/4:Now you'll see death!
16712/5:Let's go!
16712/6:Oh, this will be interesting.
16712/7:I've been waiting for this.
16713/0:Intel points to Antarctica.  There's no quick or easy way to follow up on this remotely.  Requesting deployment of an expeditionary force to the coordinates we've got.  We'll need some special troops for this, power armor and extreme weather gear.
16714/0:It's not just the big boys who need to hire mercenaries, you know.
16715/0:You will contaminate humanity no more, you fiend.
16715/1:Purity will prevail.  Your time on this earth is limited, freak.  
16715/2:Come on, gene trash.
16716/0:You will contaminate humanity no more, you fiend.
16716/1:Purity will prevail. 
16716/2:Your time on this earth is limited, freak. 
16717/0:You will contaminate humanity no more, you fiend.
16717/1:Purity will prevail. 
16717/2:Your time on this earth is limited, freak. 
16718/0:Easy, Red.  Mr. P said to lay low.
16719/0:SSC can put me in jail, but we are the majority.  If the authorities won't solve this problem, the people of Trier will.
16720/0:Her office is across from mine, on the other side of the reception area.  You the guy with covert ops training?  You want to make my day?  Bring me the balance sheet for that dive nightclub.  VOX.  Down at the end of the block.
16721/0:You're scaring me, Alex.  Be careful what you go around telling people.  You might get yourself in trouble.
16722/0:
16723/0:Follow me.
16724/0:
16725/0:
16726/0:You're asking me to join the Templars?
16727/0:It's a complicated situation.  I have the key to the back stairwell of his penthouse, but I don't stand a chance against the automated security unless I get him to let me in himself.
16728/0:Stop casing the place.
16729/0:Let's take care of this fiend.
16730/0:Let's take care of this fiend.
16731/0:Let's take care of this fiend.
16732/0:We can't let freaks like him get away with this.
16733/0:We can't let freaks like him get away with this.
16734/0:We can't let freaks like him get away with this.
16735/0:
16736/0:We can't let freaks like her get away with this.
16737/0:So you're getting a transfer?
16738/0:We can't let freaks like her get away with this.
16739/0:We can't let freaks like her get away with this.
16740/0:This affront against Nature will be eliminated.
16740/1:Filthy abomination!  It will be destroyed.
16741/0:Flight bay's opening up!  I'm comin' in!
16742/0:Probably sleepers.  Your Mag Rail contract is secure.
16743/0:Chairman Dumier of the WTO here.  So you found that old fool, Tracer Tong?  I would like to know what you were talking about.  Please report to the Trier SSC station.
16744/0:You have your orders.  Proceed.
16745/0:I programmed these units myself.
16746/0:If it was me, I'd let that pompous Brit twist in the wind.
16747/0:That bad?
16748/0:
16749/0:Let the WTO handle this disturbance.  Just answer my questions.  Who do you work for?  All non-enclave workers must leave the area until security can be restored.
16750/0:I want to finish off JC Denton.
16751/0:We want him dead, not asleep.  To be a seeker, you must shun timidness of action.
16752/0:I didn't need any help.
16753/0:I bet you don't even have an arcology pass.
16754/0:Lovely.  We have a deal.  I can't wait to do some real flyin' again.  Get in.
16755/0:Hey, I can take care of myself.
16756/0:This affront against Nature will be eliminated.
16756/1:Filthy abomination!  It will be destroyed.
16757/0:This affront against Nature will be eliminated.
16757/1:Filthy abomination!  It will be destroyed.
16758/0:Gah!  What an abomination!  We must destroy it!
16759/0:I'm sorry I dragged you into all of this.
16760/0:Gah!  What an abomination!  We must destroy it!
16761/0:If you give me the code, I'll take care of it.
16762/0:I've got work to do.
16763/0:Gah!  What an abomination!  We must destroy it!
16764/0:Bah!  Greasel!
16765/0:Oh... I was hired to clean the system out.  The spiderbots haven't really been getting the job done.
16766/0:Bah!  Greasel!
16767/0:Bah!  Greasel!
16768/0:Bah!  Greasel!
16769/0:Bah!  Greasel!
16770/0:Let's just say he won't be a problem in the future.
16771/0:I'll feel better about siding with you once you've been purified.
16772/0:I don't know.  This is my first time at an NG kiosk....
16773/0:The Seekers sabotage Panzerwerks machinery in order to halt production and allegedly protect the natural environmental "order".
16774/0:It's a good gig, working in a bar in one of the enclaves.  No complaints here.
16775/0:I just saw one of your Seekers being attacked by a couple factory workers.
16776/0:Just trying to be helpful.
16777/0:Please accept the sincere apologies of Standard Security.  Our people should have screened out the terrorists at the Lower Seattle entrance.
16778/0:I don't know how they're going to settle this situation at Panzerwerks.  I hope no one gets hurt.
16779/0:You better not mess with me!
16780/0:I want to finish off JC Denton.
16781/0:Bah!  Greasel!
16782/0:Right on -- goin' for the jackpot.  How much?
16783/0:We need a new generation of leaders -- and a plan for the generation after that.  Succession within the Illuminati is usually confined to about a dozen families, most of whom were wiped out first by MJ-12 and then by the Collapse.  As for Nicolette and myself, we were unable to have children.
16784/0: Karkian!
16785/0:Karkian!
16786/0: Karkian!
16787/0:All right.  Let's go!
16788/0: Karkian!
16789/0:Karkian!
16790/0: Karkian!
16791/0:Unearthly freak.  It must be destroyed.
16792/0:Unearthly freak.  It must be destroyed.
16793/0:Unearthly freak.  It must be destroyed.
16794/0:
16795/0:I'll take my chances.  Upstairs at the club is an Omar Trader.  He, they, it -- whatever you want to call the Omar cyborgs -- they're trying to cut into my business here in the enclave.  Levine provides sanctuary for them and gets a percentage in return.
16796/0:Welcome to WTO HQ for Seattle.  Always glad to talk to potential recruits.
16797/0:We don't appreciate outsiders hanging around.
16798/0:Thank God, she's all right.  Good work.  My people will secure the facility.  In the meantime, we should follow up on what Her Holiness learned about Luminon Saman.  Go to the tavern and hire a pilot.  If you wouild like a map of Saman's compound, report to the SSC Station on your way across town.
16799/0:You killed my brother.  Am I next?  Or have you reconsidered?
16800/0:It's one thing to mislead the customer -- but shop-owners, too?
16801/0:... punished... poor thing... never got his new toy...
16802/0:
16803/0:Out of order.
16804/0:Hi.  I'm NG Resonance.  I depend on my singing voice.  That's why I drink Pequod's coffee.  Nanoscale scrub-bots are brewed right into every serving, so the sensitive tissues in your throat are stengthened and repaired with every swallow.  Pretty cool, huh?  Not to mention the edge it gives me before a big show.  I don't know what I'd do without my Pequod's.
16805/0:JC remains in a deep coma.  You need to transfer your biomod architecture to the five JC-Helios processing modules.  Then JC Denton will want to speak with you.  I will remain offshore.  When you're ready, I will take you to your next destination.
16806/0:I mean, how loyal can you be to us if you're willing to turn against your own kind?
16807/0:It took several days before peace returned to the streets of Seattle, but there were no further disturbances afterward, although some of the tension lingers.
16808/0:By the skull of Sidon, you shall fall before me this time.
16808/1:So, you have returned to meet your fate.
16809/0:Hi.  I'm NG Resonance.  Welcome, Alex D.  Your last interaction was at Club Vox in Upper Seattle.  Why such a long journey?
16810/0:By the skull of Sidon, you shall fall before me this time.
16810/1:So, you have returned to meet your fate.
16811/0:Good work.  You found an alternate way in.
16812/0:By the skull of Sidon, you shall fall before me this time.
16812/1:So, you have returned to meet your fate.
16813/0:This time, it will end.
16813/1:You won't escape again.
16813/2:Aren't you tired of this?
16813/3:Back for more?
16813/4:Let's end this.
16813/5:You're not getting away again.
16813/6:Think how fruitless this is.
16813/7:You'll regret this.
16813/8:No mercy this time!
16813/9:You should've kept going, fool.
16813/10:Ha!  No one gets away.
16814/0:Finish the job, and let's get out of here.
16815/0:Let's have done with this!
16815/1:Purity will prevail this time.
16815/2:You cannot escape the Templars.
16815/3:I was just warming up last time.
16815/4:This time I will finish you.
16815/5:I won't let you get away.
16815/6:Now we'll end this!
16815/7:I will have satisfaction.
16815/8:Aha!
16815/9:Still here?
16815/10:You're a real pain in the ass.
16816/0:Ha!  And my friends at home said Tarsus would be boring.
16817/0:I'll be victorious this time.
16817/1:You won't escape again.
16817/2:I'm taking you down this time.
16817/3:Now we finish this!
16817/4:I've been waiting for you.
16817/5:Have some honor and finish this already.
16817/6:I won't rest until you're dead.
16817/7:You can try to hide...
16818/0:Now we're going to finish you off.
16819/0:Now we're going to finish you off.
16820/0:Do you mind?
16821/0:Now we're going to finish you off.
16822/0:Draw your weapon, fiend.  Not that it will do you much good...
16823/0:A wise shopper.
16824/0:Alex, it's so good to see you come to your senses and join our cause.  I knew you wouldn't fall for the lies of ApostleCorp or the Illuminati.  Purity is the only way to save humanity from ruin.
16825/0:Thanks for taking care of the situation in the lab.
16826/0:I'm just waiting for Mr. Dumier to give the order.
16827/0:My family has a long history with the Illuminati.   You might say the same of your bloodlines as well. 
16828/0:That hardly matters in the grand scheme of things.  You can try, but you're not going to be able to stop me from repurposing the Helios core for more beneficial purposes.
16829/0:Versalife long quiet.  Their base is nearby.
16830/0:The hazardous materials are yet to be contained, yet an unidentified man did reactivate the Inclinator and travel through the spill. His motives remain unknown.
16831/0:What?
16832/0:It wouldn't be wise for me to discuss it.  Let's go.
16833/0:Look -- smoke.  Know what's going on?
16834/0:Look -- smoke.  Know what's going on?
16835/0:What is this -- arson?
16836/0:You better go.
16837/0:So you fly modified humans around the world.  That's a pretty weird assignment.  And you're looking for one in particular...?
16838/0:What is this -- arson?
16839/0:Draw your weapon, fiend.  Not that it will do you much good...
16840/0:Who opened the door?
16841/0:Draw your weapon, fiend.  Not that it will do you much good...
16842/0:I know the church will withstand this crisis, but it's the cost that worries me.
16843/0:Who opened the door?
16844/0:Who shut the door?
16845/0:Who shut the door?
16846/0:I'm scared, Alex.  We're completely on our own, and we can't trust ANYBODY.... The only thing I know is that I'm not a killer.  Here, do you want this weapon mod?  I don't have a use for it anymore.
16847/0:Who do you fear?  The Church?  The global syndicates?  It isn't any association of HUMANS that is going to take control.
16848/0:
16848/1:
16848/2:
16848/3:
16848/4:
16849/0:Almost... got... you...  
16849/1:You're in my sights.
16850/0:Almost... got... you...  
16850/1:You're in my sights.
16851/0:
16852/0:The Arcology is serious about enforcing security.  There's no way in without an official passcode.
16853/0:Here we go...
16854/0:It's rough, but we can't give in.
16855/0:I feel a little dizzy.  (cough cough)
16856/0:Violation in progress.  
16856/1:Security compromise detected.
16856/2:Security measures initiating.
16856/3:Access tampering is not tolerated.
16857/0:Sure. [20 credits]
16858/0:I miss the ice and the others.
16859/0:I heard our guys just walked right in there... some sort of corporate lab in the arcology, right?  It wasn't much of a "capture" since he's just a block of ice.
16860/0:Someone blasted their way through the door.  Any idea who?
16861/0:Greetings.  You are in close proximity to an entity of great interest to the Omar -- the cadaver of an unusual mutant.  We are interested in the properties of the mutant's tissues.  Please locate the biometric report.  We will upload the data through your infolink interface.  End of proposal.
16862/0:I want to fight, but what is there to fight?  Dust.  Nothing but dust.
16863/0:Someone blasted their way through the door.  Any idea who?
16864/0:Just a minute.
16865/0:That wasn't there before, was it?
16866/0:That wasn't there before, was it?
16867/0:Do you think someone took it?
16868/0:Do you think someone took it?
16869/0:You are lost, my friend.  The tavern's clear on the other side of town -- to the west.
16870/0:Looks deliberate to me.  Know what happened?
16871/0:Oh -- is that a biomod canister?  Thanks.
16872/0:Looks deliberate to me.  Know what happened?
16873/0:It's completely destroyed.  Is the culprit still around?
16873/1:Must be a vandal around.  Know where I should start looking?
16874/0:It's completely destroyed.  Is the culprit still around?
16874/1:Must be a vandal around.  Know where I should start looking?
16875/0:And where are they getting this firepower and training?  Obviously they're organized.
16876/0:
16877/0:All this spelunking just paid off... you found a biomod canister!  I wouldn't worry if it's collected a little dust -- your systems can incorporate the old protocol.
16878/0:What about Her Holiness?  Doesn't she decide what the Church stands for?
16879/0:And they don't even know it's coming, that something historic is about to happen to each and every one of them.
16880/0:Maybe next time.
16881/0:The Omar appreciate good customers.
16882/0:Universal.  Are you sure?  That would screw up the market pretty bad.  Why would Tarsus want to undercut their own product?
16883/0:They won't catch me sleeping.
16884/0:You can pass.
16885/0:Lost my big toe to a greasel a couple years ago.  I was a little drunk, and it came at me from underneath a dumpster.
16886/0:In the wake of the unprecedented terrorist attack on Chicago, enclave-area residents are taking a harder look at those groups who oppose WTO expansion.
16887/0:Billie... a Templar...?  Wow, am I the only one without a secret alliance?
16888/0:I wish the real NG would come to North America again.  She's awesome live.
16889/0:Never hurts to be prepared for an emergency, I suppose.
16890/0:Huh?
16890/1:Eh?
16890/2:Oh?
16891/0:Interesting theory.  What is it you want from me?
16892/0:Did someone throw that?
16893/0:Did someone throw that?
16894/0:I do not expect to have my inventory replenished for a while, unfortunately.
16895/0:Huh, that's funny.  See who opened it?
16896/0:JC Denton needs you alive in order for the procedure to work.  That is the only reason I haven't abandoned you.
16897/0:Huh, that's funny.  See who opened it?
16898/0:Don't play any of your games with me.  I know how to take care of myself.
16899/0:I have some subpeonaes to write.
16900/0:Someone just closed this.  Right?
16901/0:Like it or not, Alex, we need each other.  It won't be easy for me to forgive your behavior, but I will have to try.  What we need you to do now is check out the Mako facility north of town.  We know they've been doing illegal weapons research and that your former trainer, Dr. Nassif, has contacts there.  You'll need to hire a pilot and leave at once.
16902/0:Someone just closed this.  Right?
16903/0:Who turned it on?
16904/0:Who turned it on?
16905/0:The WTO wants to know some specifics about your research, Dr. Nassif, and where it's still being carried out.  Tell me more about this Tracer Tong and the facility in Trier.
16906/0:Who turned it off?
16907/0:Who turned it off?
16908/0:It looks like they're getting things under control around here.
16909/0:Frag mod's too expensive. [1000]
16910/0:After what I made on this fight?  I'm buyin' a steak dinner -- for me AND Shutterbug.
16911/0:You're starting to hurt my feelings.
16912/0:My sister-in-law, she's saving up for a bionic eye.  But I guess Piezochem has a monopoly on the surgery, thanks to the WTO, so it's kind of a pipe dream, if you ask me.  The price is set in stone.
16913/0:It's malfunctioning.  Who was just here?
16914/0:It's malfunctioning.  Who was just here?
16915/0:Did you see who turned off this device?
16916/0:Did you see who turned off this device?
16917/0:Did someone turn on the light?
16918/0:Did someone turn on the light?
16919/0:Here's the code to the lab.  Just check back in with me when the job's done and I'll give you your pay.  [100]
16920/0:You're gettn' kinda clingy, man.
16921/0:
16922/0:Did you see who turned off the light?
16923/0:Imagine how much money the executives of the parent company must make.  If I play my cards right, that is where my career ladder will take me.
16924/0:Did you see who turned off the light?
16925/0:They don't usually react like that if it isn't a person.  What do you think?
16926/0:They don't usually react like that if it isn't a person.  What do you think?
16927/0:Here's the money to mark the map.  [200 credits]
16928/0:Our condolences to the families and friends of all those lost in the Chicago incident.
16929/0:Someone oughtta cook Gob-zilla in her cage.  Give someone else a chance to make a living at this racket.
16930/0:Within our protective barrier is a cozy cafe atmosphere as sealed and secure as any WTO arcology.
16931/0:My parents warned me about becoming an artist.  Then they cut me off.
16932/0:You sure?
16933/0:Well, I've turned your heart just in time.  Now make sure that both Dentons have been killed, then step into JC Denton's machine inside the Statue so that the ducts will be primed with your nanite-capsid architecture.  My scientists will do the rest.
16934/0:When he came to us, he made the earth move according to whim.  He sculpted a habitat for himself, near to our colony on the ice.
16935/0:Doctor... Doctor!  We have a Code Yellow.
16936/0:Hang on -- There's a Templar military bot on patrol near this sector.  You may want to rethink travel in this area.  
16937/0:Inadequate funds.
16938/0:Did something scare the pigeons?
16939/0:Did something scare the pigeons?
16940/0:I bet they aren't even working on a cure.  And who could blame them -- none of their families ever get sick.
16941/0:Did something scare the birds?
16942/0:Did something scare the birds?
16943/0:What spooked the rats?
16944/0:What spooked the rats?
16945/0:What's got into the cat?
16946/0:We need a common set of laws -- and one police force.
16947/0:What's got into the cat?
16948/0:I'm tracking down an intruder.  Can you tell me anything?
16949/0:I'm tracking down an intruder.  Can you tell me anything?
16950/0:You've come this far -- I think it's time to finish this thing.
16951/0:Maybe I can settle things on Mr. Black's behalf.
16952/0:You're hired.  I need a lift to Trier, Germany. [500 credits]
16953/0:Vmail sender replied:
16954/0:People want to believe certain things about their leaders.  That's always been our key to power.
16955/0:Not now.  I'm concentrating.
16956/0:I'm glad you are willing to betray Tong's confidence.
16957/0:What's the alternative?
16958/0:This is way more than I bargained for when I signed on.
16959/0:Right!  Miss Withers...  She's pretty cool for someone who went to business school.
16960/0:
16960/1:
16961/0:Cindy.  Nah, she went all screwy in the head.
16962/0:You're inside.  Good.  The Sequencing Module should be stored on Saman's private computer.  More when you reach the Luminon's command area.
16963/0:I want the ammo clip. [200]
16964/0:You have your orders.  Proceed.
16965/0:Huh.  My lucky day.  I see that it pays to have old friends from Tarsus.
16966/0:Get a good look at the scab?
16967/0:Thanks for the warm welcome.
16968/0:Get a good look at the scab?
16969/0:There's been some fighting.  See anything?
16969/1:Notice anything unusual?  Someone's here and they're armed.
16970/0:I don't know.  This is my first time at an NG kiosk....
16971/0:There's been some fighting.  See anything?
16971/1:Notice anything unusual?  Someone's here and they're armed.
16972/0:There's a killer on the loose.  Notice anything unusual?
16972/1:There's been a murder.  See anything?
16973/0:Sounds as though you like it here.
16974/0:There's a killer on the loose.  Notice anything unusual?
16974/1:There's been a murder.  See anything?
16975/0:A picket-line in the Lower City.  I was standing point at the entrance to the Inclinator.  Some beggar dove under the platform and tried to climb up into the enclave.
16976/0:See where the thief went?
16976/1:We've got a thief on our hands.  Any clues?
16977/0:See where the thief went?
16977/1:We've got a thief on our hands.  Any clues?
16978/0:We better find this crook or it could mean our jobs.  Any theories?
16979/0:We better find this crook or it could mean our jobs.  Any theories?
16980/0:No use riskin' my bird until you're ready to move out.
16981/0:Hey, I got a lot on my mind.
16982/0:If you're half the operative Leo is, you'll go for it.
16983/0:Well, don't be intimidated by my ranking.  I make a point of treating every team member as an equal.
16984/0:Unifying the world's religions is a difficult enterprise.  What we must do -- and I ask your help in this -- is determine what happened to Captain Lamar so that we can assess the operation.  Just as you arrived I got a report that he abandoned his unit.
16985/0:Toxicity and radiation levels are now within safe limits.
16986/0:Wish I had the cash to get you a pilot.  [500]
16987/0:Passengers and patrons should be prepared for delays.
16988/0:The question is whether you want to give individuals the power to impose such organization on a global scale -- and to imprint it, biologically, on our hearts and minds.
16989/0:Come on, Bud.  Fill me in.  Did you hit it off?
16990/0:Hey, Red, what're we gonna do about this lady?
16991/0:Very perceptive.  You look like one of those of Tarsus kids who hang around here.  They'd do the job -- maybe just lob a grenade in there or something.  Interested in a little adventure?
16992/0:
16993/0:I don't mind bending the rules in order to save her life.
16994/0:What do you take me for, mister?
16995/0:What do you take me for, mister?
16996/0:What do you take me for, lady?
16997/0:In time, it will all become clear.
16998/0:What do you take me for, lady?
16999/0:Maybe take a look over there.
16999/1:I have my suspicions.  Caught a blip on the radar from over there.
16999/2:That way.  I just have a hunch.
17000/0:Stay with me!
17001/0:Maybe take a look over there.
17001/1:I have my suspicions.  Caught a blip on the radar from over there.
17001/2:That way.  I just have a hunch.
17002/0:Stay with me!
17003/0:How does the Church and Mr. Dumier plan to deal with New Cairo?  There won't be any enclave citizens to convert if the Templars get their way.
17004/0:I think the troublemaker's over there.
17005/0:Look!
17006/0:I think the troublemaker's over there.
17007/0:Look!
17008/0:I think the man went that way.
17009/0:Get back here!
17009/1:What's the meaning of this?
17009/2:You won't get away with this...
17009/3:I know you're here... fess up!
17009/4:Stop sneaking around!
17009/5:You better pray I don't find you!
17009/6:Don't jump out at me, okay?  I have a heart condition... 
17010/0:I think the man went that way.
17011/0:Get back here!
17011/1:What's the meaning of this?
17011/2:You won't get away with this...
17011/3:I know you're there!
17011/4:Don't think that you can hide from me!
17011/5:Stop skulking around!
17011/6:Get out here and face me!
17011/7:I'm gonna do my duty!
17011/8:You aren't makin' a fool out of me!
17012/0:I think the lady went that way.
17013/0:I think the lady went that way.
17014/0:What about the VIP area?  What goes on back there?
17015/0:Hm.  I think I saw something over there.
17016/0:Hm.  I think I saw something over there.
17017/0:Let me think about it.
17018/0:The streets are deserted.  You better get going.  The show must be in full swing!
17019/0:We perform our duties without hesitation.
17020/0:Hey -- how did you get in here?
17021/0:The transgenic tissue scan you recovered from Club Vox is already producing improvements in Omar survivability.
17022/0:Which they will appropriate for themselves, whoever finds it first.
17023/0:Great, get us thrown out.  That's what I get for cuttin' in one of my low-life friends.
17024/0:Glad someone finally took care of it.
17025/0:The event happened in the greenhouse, where Leila and her parents were hiding.  No one knows who the killers were or what they wanted.
17026/0:Let's just say he won't be a problem in the future.
17027/0:What's goin' on?!
17027/1:NOW what?
17028/0:What's goin' on?!
17028/1:NOW what?
17029/0:The individual worker -- careerist, let's say -- seldom understands how his small labor contributes to human history.  Seemingly innocuous innovations in cell biology, nanotechnology, and computer science add up to a teeming substrate of new life.  But it isn't life.  It's death.  It seeks to devour its clumsy, organic creators.
17030/0:Hey!  What's the idea?
17030/1:Not so fast!
17031/0:Hey!  What's the idea?
17031/1:Not so fast!
17032/0:Just listen.  There was a racket over there just now.
17032/1:Coulda swore I heard someone take off that way.
17033/0:Move in!
17034/0:Just listen.  There was a racket over there just now.
17034/1:Coulda swore I heard someone take off that way.
17035/0:Move in!
17036/0:You will appreciate our merchandise.  Your purchases will be restricted to the highest market prices because of your earlier attack on our kind.
17037/0:This is a crime scene.  Please leave.
17038/0:Well, I saw a shadow just now....  Try that way.
17039/0:I'm on him!
17040/0:Well, I saw a shadow just now....  Try that way.
17041/0:I'm on him!
17042/0:This is SSC headquarters for Trier.  
17043/0:I'm on her!
17044/0:Right.... Jankowski.  It's great to finally meet you.
17045/0:I'm on her!
17046/0:Look.  Blood.
17047/0:(inhale-exhale)
17048/0:Look.  Blood.
17049/0:Look.  A fire.  Maybe check over there.
17050/0:Look.  A fire.  Maybe check over there.
17051/0:
17052/0:Did you tell the authorities?
17053/0:Your science is too cruel.
17054/0:No worries, scally.  But fair warning -- don't expect a ride back to Seattle.  This town's burned me one too many times.
17055/0:A shame we won't be working together.  Maybe another day.
17056/0:It's time for you to go.
17057/0:I'm serious.  I could give you the key to my back stairwell.  You could have drinks and hors d'oeuvres ready before we arrive.
17058/0:Just got the thrusters cranked.  This bird sings so loud now my head's ringin'.
17059/0:Pequod's -- coffee for a new generation.
17060/0:Go on.
17061/0:Due to the pollution I've never really explored the medina.  Maybe I'll try to find that coffee stand everyone talks about.
17062/0:I heard that!
17062/1:Just keep up the racket...
17063/0:Don't tell me.  You're one of them big-city reporters thinks she's gonna sweet-talk the management into giving her a peek at the new weapon.
17064/0:I heard that!
17064/1:Just keep up the racket...
17065/0:Oh my god!
17065/1:Damn!  // in a panic
17065/2:Aaaa!
17065/3:U-u-u-u-h...
17066/0:Oh my god!
17066/1:Damn!  // in a panic
17066/2:Aaaa!
17066/3:U-u-u-u-h...
17067/0:Maybe check over by where that smoke's coming from.
17068/0:(growl)
17068/1:Hey!
17068/2:Guess it's up to me...  // worried
17068/3:... always on my shift.
17068/4:Oh-boy... Here we go..!
17068/5:I've got you in my sights!
17068/6:You're gonna get it now!
17069/0:Maybe check over by where that smoke's coming from.
17070/0:(growl)
17070/1:Hey!
17070/2:Guess it's up to me...
17070/3:... always on my shift.
17070/4:You're in for it now.
17070/5:Puttin' my training to work...
17070/6:That's it -- you're dead.
17070/7:All right -- bonus time.
17070/8:This'll be quick.
17070/9:Finally -- some action.
17070/10:I'm takin' you down.
17070/11:I can do this.
17070/12:You're in for it now!  
17070/13:Ha!  I'm not gonna give you the chance...
17070/14:I guess it's you or me.
17070/15:Oh boy -- here we go!
17071/0:We keep our operations secret for a reason, Alex.  Don't expect a full debriefing while you're still in danger of being captured.  Now install your biomods and get out of there.
17072/0:Look over there.  There's been some recent fighting.
17073/0:Get out of here!  I mean it!
17073/1:I'm ready to use force!
17073/2:Okay.... you asked for it!
17073/3:Looks like you goofed.
17073/4:Don't mess with the SSC! I mean it!  
17073/5:You're NOT going to get away...!
17073/6:I'm gonna get you!!  
17074/0:Look over there.  There's been some recent fighting.
17075/0:Get out of here!  I mean it!
17075/1:I'm ready to use force!
17075/2:Okay.... you asked for it!
17075/3:Looks like you goofed.
17075/4:Come on!  See this uniform?  Huh?!
17075/5:Leave!  That's an order!
17076/0:Wish I could help.
17076/1:I'm at a loss myself.
17076/2:No idea.  Sorry.
17077/0:You're luck ran out, dude.
17078/0:Wish I could help.
17078/1:I'm at a loss myself.
17078/2:No idea.  Sorry.
17079/0:You're luck ran out, dude.
17080/0:Hi.
17080/1:Hey.
17081/0:Hi.
17081/1:Hey.
17082/0:Don't worry, I'll figure out how to get to New York.  I want to see what that's all about.
17083/0:Hello.
17083/1:Hey.
17084/0:I'll bet that the shipment hasn't even left Germany.
17085/0:Hello.
17085/1:Hey.
17086/0:I'm ready.
17087/0:Understood.
17088/0:
17089/0:Looks like you've stumbled across messages from the Versalife team.  When the net went black, they must've been utterly stranded here... Isolated from the world, trapped with the transgenics, running out of food -- it can't have been pretty.  I wonder if any managed to escape.
17090/0:Any economic system designed for millions of people soon begins to live for its own sake.
17091/0:New fare.  Five times the old one.
17092/0:These freaks came out of the Russian Famine.  They put their own survival ahead of any set of laws...
17093/0:An admirable gesture regarding my brother.  Now help us acquire an Aquinas hub, and maybe we'll be able to trust each other again.
17094/0:
17095/0:I'm being punished for being born into a poor family.
17096/0:Sterling.
17097/0:As you wish .. but I assure you that you haven't seen the last of Dr. Nassif.
17098/0:Maybe I could help if I knew who it was.
17099/0:Fantastic.  The nanformers will begin cleaning up the pollution in the medina right away.  The air should be safe within twenty-four hours.
17100/0:I tried to get corporate headquarters interested.  What do you think happened?
17101/0:Oh -- you the guy with covert ops training?  You want to make my day?  Bring me the balance sheet for that dive nightclub.  VOX.  Down at the end of the block.
17102/0:We are, but first the clam must give up its pearl.  Good luck, Denton.  I will call on you when the time comes.  In case you need a pilot to take you to the compound, the Nine Worlds Tavern is a good place to hire one.
17103/0:You're luck ran out, hun'.
17104/0:In the wake of the Collapse, the WTO seized upon this highly integrated and compact urban form as a solution to the present toxicity and sprawl that were only exacerbated by the Collapse.  Not all WTO enclaves use this architecture, but in the environments that demand safe, sealed and tightly-knit cities have found success with this structure.
17105/0:You're luck ran out, hun'.
17106/0:Another one on the loose...
17106/1:Go on, get out of here!
17107/0:Another one on the loose...
17107/1:Go on, get out of here!
17108/0:Officer.
17108/1:Hang in there!  // cheery
17108/2:How's it going?
17109/0:Here we go!
17109/1:Let's make it quick.
17109/2:Look out!
17109/3:Back me up.
17110/0:Sorry, old boy.  I can't do much until I get my wings back.
17111/0:Officer.
17111/1:Hang in there!  // cheery
17111/2:How's it going?
17112/0:Here we go!
17112/1:Let's make it quick.
17112/2:Look out!
17112/3:Back me up.
17113/0:... just counting the minutes.
17113/1:What's up.
17114/0:Let's get him!
17115/0:... just counting the minutes.
17115/1:What's up.
17116/0:Let's get him!
17117/0:Good to see you...  // overly warm
17117/1:Hi there.  // cheery, stiff
17118/0:Let's get her!
17119/0:Good to see you...  // overly warm
17119/1:Hi there.  // cheery, stiff
17120/0:Let's get her!
17121/0:Hello, hello...  // cheerful
17121/1:Another day on my feet... // cheerful
17122/0:Hello, hello...  // cheerful
17122/1:Another day on my feet... // cheerful
17123/0:Is what you said true?
17123/1:It's more than rumors, isn't it?
17123/2:They finally dropped the gauntlet, huh?
17123/3:I've been thinking.  Are you sure he told you THAT?
17123/4:Hate to beat a dead horse, but... I mean, really?
17124/0:Is what you said true?
17124/1:It's more than rumors, isn't it?
17124/2:They finally dropped the gauntlet, huh?
17124/3:I've been thinking.  Are you sure he told you THAT?
17124/4:Hate to beat a dead horse, but... I mean, really?
17125/0:Hop in, scally.
17126/0:I'm sorry, but your request violates protocol.  You need to have an account with us and contact us by the approved means.  Thank you for your interest.
17127/0:I have no money, but I'm a doctor.  I'd be willing to tend to any battle wounds.
17128/0:What's it to you?
17129/0:A true democracy will prevent militant cults the Templars from gaining so much influence over the weak-minded. 
17130/0:Can it be fixed?
17131/0:Touch nothing.
17132/0:
17133/0:My head is spinning.
17134/0:When were you planning on telling the public about the WTO and Order connections?
17135/0:
17136/0:
17137/0:
17138/0:Get it!
17138/1:Gah!  Whoever made these things...
17139/0:Get it!
17139/1:Gah!  Whoever made these things...
17140/0:Knocked her out? !  Gob-zilla?  Tina'll just pump it full of zyme, and it'll bounce back twice as mean.  There aren't a lot of rules in this business.
17141/0:
17142/0:Back to the frog pond, freak.
17143/0:Back to the frog pond, freak.
17144/0:Wonder what kinda bonus I get for a baby T-rex.
17145/0:New Cairo atmospheric conditions -- normal.
17146/0:What now?
17147/0:They don't even know what it is that got spilled yet.
17148/0:Wonder what kinda bonus I get for a baby T-rex.
17149/0:Much change and choice in the coming hours.
17150/0:I'm listening...
17151/0:Order be praised -- those crooks have been trying to run us out of town.  Now take care of Sak so that she can't hire replacements.
17152/0:It's gigantic...
17153/0:It's gigantic...
17154/0:Looks like something from outer space!
17155/0:Looks like something from outer space!
17156/0:What a fool.
17157/0:I must be too skinny.  I wonder how this thing will handle in a fight.
17158/0:A biomod infusion succeeds for one of my relatives, and suddenly we are vermin.  All of the Nassifs.  I didn't invent biomodification.  Why do they want to kill ME?
17159/0:Good, you found the molecular spec for the counter-nanite.  Now put an end to the Chairman's scheme by reprogramming the nanoformer bots to synthesize the cure.  The bot kennels are near the exterior on Level 107.
17160/0:I've already been there.  I'm pretty sure I killed that guy.
17161/0:Anyway, I'm hoping to find someone with more guts than these guys to do some quick "contract" work for a decent number of credits.  If you manage to take care of it, report back to me, so I can pay you.  Until then, no one's going to be able to get down to Lower Seattle. [100 credits]
17162/0:Piezochem.... Medkits.  Respirators.  Bots for recovery and medical assistence.  Providing necessary products as we stand beside you in a difficult time.
17163/0:You see where this is going.  The Minister should be out this time of night, living it up at Club Vox.
17164/0:Another obstacle in your Search, young Seeker -- the inclinator, which is the only way to reach Lower Seattle and our church, has been shut down because of a toxic spill.  The hazard flush system or a nanoformer bot could clean up the mess, but the maintenance team is blocked from using either.  For more details, you might talk to the facility director in her office.
17165/0:An interesting discovery.  So Dr. Nassif has a cousin at the Tarsus Academy in New Cairo.  The visitation pass will let you enter the school on Level 107 of the arcology.  Find the cousin, Eeva, and see if she leads you to ApostleCorp.  First you will need a pass to the arcology itself, though.  Maybe you can get one from someone in the medina.
17166/0:Decide where you stand, Alex.  It won't be long before you have to choose.
17167/0:Sorry, I don't have enough money.
17168/0:The people attacking Tarsus -- are they the ones responsible for Chicago?  What's going on?
17169/0:Clear the hallways!  Return to your stations!
17170/0:She's all yours.
17171/0:
17172/0:Identification:  Subject Alex Denton.
17173/0:I have a black-market biomod canister, which enables non-Piezochem functionality.  I am also selling three energy cells for powering your biomodified systems.  Or you might want two EMP grenades, for disrupting electronic devices, such as surveillance equipment.  As a regular customer, you must pay full price for each.
17174/0:It's programmed to attack people!
17175/0:It's programmed to attack people!
17176/0:I'm still here!
17176/1:... gotta finish this...
17176/2:Stop playin' games!
17176/3:There you are!
17176/4:Holy -- you're still here?
17176/5:You shoulda run.
17177/0:I'm still here!
17177/1:... gotta finish this...
17177/2:Stop playin' games!
17177/3:There you are!
17177/4:Thought my bonus ran off...
17177/5:Back for more?
17177/6:Don't know when to quit, do you?
17177/7:Try and shake me this time!
17177/8:Came back for seconds?
17177/9:I won't be made a fool of twice!
17178/0:How long we gonna play this game?
17179/0:How long we gonna play this game?
17180/0:... tough little bugger...
17181/0:... tough little bugger...
17182/0:Peace will return slowly now.
17183/0:We're back in business!
17183/1:Over here!
17183/2:Another shot at the money...
17184/0:Without extraordinary individuals, civilization will founder.  Total homogeneity -- now THAT'S unnatural.  That's what we have to resist at all cost.
17185/0:We're back in business!
17185/1:Over here!
17185/2:Another shot at the money...
17186/0:No, no.  Not me.  
17187/0:You're crazy!  Taking the Inclinator through that mess... it's suicide!
17188/0:I don't think I know you.
17189/0:I'd take the east side of the island back from the Templars.
17190/0:So you're going to stand out here until you freeze to death.
17191/0:Vitakka... vitakka... vitakka....
17192/0:I'm calling for a bot.
17193/0:Sometehing wrong?
17193/1:Carry on.
17194/0:This is WTO Security Chief Donna Morgan.  I don't know what the hell you think you're doing, but you better get your ass to the WTO Terminal.  That's an order.
17195/0:Sir.
17196/0:Let's keep this deal quiet.  Cool?
17197/0:He's right here!
17197/1:Stop him this time!
17197/2:Oh crap!  There he is!
17198/0:Ma'am
17199/0:Wish I had the buy-in money, but I don't.  [100]
17200/0:He's right here!
17200/1:Stop him this time!
17201/0:
17202/0:She's right here!
17202/1:Stop her this time!
17202/2:Oh crap!  There she is!
17203/0:Here's a quick lesson in evolution!
17203/1:
17204/0:She's right here!
17204/1:Stop her this time!
17205/0:Here's a quick lesson in evolution!
17205/1:
17206/0:Did I catch you by surprise?
17206/1:Don't reach for a weapon!
17207/0:The Order -- Hmpf!  Tree-hugging pansies...
17208/0:Here's a quick lesson in evolution!
17208/1:
17209/0:Did I catch you by surprise?
17209/1:Don't reach for a weapon!
17210/0:Why'd they build it under the Black Gate?
17211/0:In spite of your poor foresight we're still going to deploy the tech on time.  The Templar forces must be supported by this armor in their initial sweep against the mod-freaks.  But that doesn't mean I won't find the time to stop by and exterminate YOU as soon as we're finished. 
17212/0:Good.  I will make sure that the body is destroyed.  You are timid in action, my seeker, but at least Dr. Nassif will not be talking.  Come.  Hire a pilot at Pequod's coffee shop on Level 107 and help us pick up the trail in Germany.
17213/0:To the Dentons consciousness is a building material.  To the Illuminati consciousness is a currency.
17214/0:Purity WILL prevail.
17215/0:Alex D.  The information you provided our agent has proven valuable.  He was successful against the invaders and would like to thank you.  Your future business with the Omar will proceed on much more favorable terms.
17216/0:Now I just need to find Sid and go, right?
17217/0:By the time we figured out what was happening, it was too late.
17218/0:That's quite a claim.
17219/0:That's a pretty scabby part of town -- mostly abandoned factories.  The Order renovated the cathedral, but, man... a lot of ways to end up dead in the Rauchstadt.
17220/0:Can't take a hint, huh?
17221/0:Too dangerous!
17221/1:Can't talk now!
17222/0:Ugh.  Careful -- this one's dangerous.
17223/0:Too dangerous!
17223/1:Can't talk now!
17224/0:Ugh.  Careful -- this one's dangerous.
17225/0:
17226/0:Too dangerous!
17226/1:Can't talk now!
17227/0:Ugh.  Careful -- this one's dangerous.
17228/0:Too dangerous!
17228/1:Can't talk now!
17229/0:(grunt) I'm hit!
17229/1:(grunt) Oh, lucky shot!
17230/0:It was an accident...
17231/0:(grunt) I'm hit!
17231/1:(grunt) Oh, lucky shot!
17232/0:Thanks, mister.
17233/0:It was an accident...
17234/0:(grunt) I'm hit!
17234/1:(grunt) Oh, lucky shot!
17235/0:It was an accident...
17236/0:(grunt) He got me!
17237/0:You could be the police chief.  The Templars would be afraid of YOU.
17238/0:It was an accident...
17239/0:(grunt) He got me!
17240/0:Excellent work.  Without that machine, ApostleCorp's agenda is finished, and the Templars have no means to disperse their counternanite.
17241/0:(sneeze)
17241/1:(grumble)
17241/2:(whistle)
17241/3:(hum)
17242/0:(grunt) He got me!
17243/0:Gotta keep steady...
17243/1:I know how to use this thing!
17243/2:In my sights...
17244/0:The mob from Panzerwerks spread into the city and went after anyone wearing an Order robe.
17245/0:(sneeze)
17245/1:(grumble)
17245/2:(whistle)
17245/3:(hum)
17246/0:(grunt) She got me!
17247/0:Gotta keep steady...
17247/1:I know how to use this thing!
17247/2:In my sights...
17248/0:My shot!
17248/1:Guess I don't have any other choice.
17249/0:My shot!
17249/1:Guess I don't have any other choice.
17250/0:He's right where I want him!
17251/0:If you don't have a school pass, you shouldn't be in there.  All parents and guardians get one.
17252/0:He's right where I want him!
17253/0:What were you doing in there?
17254/0:The scientists who ran our training.  Tarsus was a front.
17255/0:Are you interested in doing business?
17256/0:I don't think you'll find your ApostleCorp official out sightseeing at the Black Gate ruins, which is where the sewer leads.  Regardless, it would be a shame to lose you to a pack of sewer greasels. 
17257/0:The more devout Seekers want a strict interpretation of the scriptures, which I guess were written around the time of the Collapse.
17258/0:Yeah...  I saw her in the students' hideout in the ventilation system.
17259/0:I dropped you right in front of Nine Worlds Tavern.  Best starkbier in the city.  Not a bad place to ask around if you want to find one of the locals.  Lemme park the jet, and you can find me at the tavern later when you're ready for another hop.
17260/0:If you kill me, JC will never let you leave the island alive.
17261/0:My disappointment with you is beyond words, Alex.  Chairman Dumier himself was depending on that interrogation.  You are on the verge of making some very powerful enemies.
17262/0:(sneeze)
17262/1:(grumble)
17262/2:(whistle)
17262/3:(hum)
17263/0:(grunt) She got me!
17264/0:(sneeze)
17264/1:(grumble)
17264/2:(whistle)
17264/3:(hum)
17265/0:(grunt) She got me!
17266/0:They wreck our factory, and I'M the one who gets locked up?
17267/0:Yeah?  What's that scumbag up to?  Give me something I can get a warrant with, and it means a Citizen's Bonus to you.
17268/0:(screaming)
17268/1:I'm on fire!
17268/2:It burns!
17269/0:(screaming)
17269/1:I'm on fire!
17269/2:It burns!
17270/0:(screaming)
17270/1:I'm on fire!
17270/2:It burns!
17271/0:She's right where I want her!
17272/0:(moan) Was that... poison?!
17272/1:(moan) Oh God, I feel sick...  
17273/0:She's right where I want her!
17274/0:He isn't exactly safe with my former classmate, Billie Adams, skulking around.  She went over to the Templars.
17275/0:(moan) Was that... poison?!
17275/1:(moan) Oh God, I feel sick...  
17276/0:Get out while you can!
17277/0:(moan) Was that... poison?!
17277/1:(moan) Oh God, I feel sick...  
17278/0:Hello.
17278/1:Peace, my friend.
17278/2:The Church welcomes all visitors.
17279/0:I can't see!
17279/1:I'm blind!
17280/0:Full authorization!  Attack mode!  Now!
17280/1:Get the scab, you worthless pile of junk!
17281/0:Chairman Dumier lusts for worldly power.  JC Denton, what's left of him, lusts for worldly bliss.  And to both of them you are nothing but a finely wrought tool.
17282/0:I can't see!
17282/1:I'm blind!
17283/0:Full authorization!  Attack mode!  Now!
17283/1:Get the scab, you worthless pile of junk!
17284/0:This is a job for the bots.  Better summon one right away...
17284/1:Wish the bot would get here...
17285/0:This is a job for the bots.  Better summon one right away...
17285/1:Wish the bot would get here...
17286/0:A repair bot could take care of this.
17287/0:I am never going to finish this if you keep distracting me.
17288/0:Director Carnegie from Chicago will handle your inquiries.
17289/0:A repair bot could take care of this.
17290/0:You know you're living in an age of warlords when people start running around calling themselves Knights.
17291/0:Very well.  Alex, may I give you some advice?
17292/0:Belief needs no armaments!
17293/0:I guess they never invented a bot that cleans other bots.
17294/0:Dr. Nassif, please report to A-17.
17295/0:Amazing -- I almost turned into a crook over a month's dues.  I don't know what got into me.
17296/0:You're going to criticize the leader of the WTO -- in print?
17297/0:We have tried to spread our word quietly, but too many have fallen under the spell of this corrupt technology.  Since when is strength more important than aspiration?  Since when is the mind more important that the pursuit of wisdom?  Hear us, citizens!  In times to come, you will thank us for our bravery.
17298/0:The Templars are one step ahead of us, but not for long.  Repair the Gate with the Sequencing Module.  Find your long-lost older brother on the other side, then wait for my orders.
17299/0:I can't see!
17299/1:I'm blind!
17300/0:Leave me.
17301/0:Nooo...
17301/1:But... (gasp) 
17301/2:But I never did anything!
17302/0:Alex, Paul has already joined me inside the Statue.  Before my machine will work, however, we need the Aquinas Protocol specification from a computer on the lower level of UNATCO.  Yes, my machine taps into MJ-12's old network, but this time the network will be a tool for everyone.
17303/0:Nooo...
17303/1:But... (gasp) 
17303/2:But I never did anything!
17304/0:Nooo...
17304/1:But... (gasp) 
17305/0:I can't believe you reactivated the Inclinator line.
17306/0:Explosives!
17307/0:(moan)
17307/1:(groan)
17307/2:(grunt)
17308/0:A med bot could take care of that.
17309/0:Explosives!
17310/0:(moan)
17310/1:(groan)
17310/2:(grunt)
17311/0:A med bot could take care of that.
17312/0:I'll let you get back to your run.
17313/0:
17314/0:Explosives!
17315/0:(moan)
17315/1:(groan)
17315/2:(grunt)
17316/0:Better let the drone handle it...
17316/1:No need to stick out my neck when I could use a drone.
17317/0:Let's take out the Illuminati Grand Master, Chad Dumier.
17318/0:
17319/0:
17320/0:Explosives!
17321/0:(grunt)Everything's spinning...
17321/1:(grunt)I don't feel so good.
17321/2:(grunt)
17322/0:Better let the drone handle it...
17322/1:No need to stick out my neck when I could use a drone.
17323/0:I was attacked.  Seen anyone suspicious?
17324/0:(grunt)Everything's spinning...
17324/1:(grunt)I don't feel so good.
17324/2:(grunt)
17325/0:I missed!
17325/1:Not connecting...
17326/0:I ain't takin' a bullet for no private.
17327/0:I was attacked.  Seen anyone suspicious?
17328/0:(grunt)Everything's spinning...
17328/1:(grunt)I don't feel so good.
17328/2:(grunt)
17329/0:I missed!
17329/1:Not connecting...
17330/0:You try!
17331/0:You try!
17332/0:I can't hit him!
17333/0:Cheer up.  The Plague is gone.
17334/0:I can't hit him!
17335/0:I'm sorry.  They don't pay me to interface with the public.
17336/0:Yeah...  I saw her in the students' hideout in the ventilation system.
17337/0:We are here to rescue you from an inhumane scientific experiment.  Hear us.  You have been brainwashed.  Reject Tarsus and the tyrants who established it.
17338/0:May Her Holiness watch over and guide you.
17339/0:More than that, if you ask me.  People have to think alike before they can act alike.  I think WTO types should listen to seekers, just as seekers should learn to see the benefits of the WTO.
17340/0:I've got the master code for all the apartment doors and the key to the rear entrance to the penthouse.
17341/0:I was attacked.  Seen anyone suspicious?
17342/0:(gasp)
17343/0:Maybe fly-by was just a prank?  I don't know.  But the WTO doesn't really have a sense of humor about these sorts of things.
17344/0:I was attacked.  Seen anyone suspicious?
17345/0:(gasp)
17346/0:
17346/1:
17346/2:
17346/3:
17346/4:
17347/0:Some monster attacked me, and now I've got to find it -- seen anything?
17348/0:(gasp)
17349/0:Some monster attacked me, and now I've got to find it -- seen anything?
17350/0:Hold still!
17350/1:I can't believe I missed!
17351/0:Some monster attacked me, and now I've got to find it -- seen anything?
17352/0:Hold still!
17352/1:I can't believe I missed!
17353/0:Some monster attacked me, and now I've got to find it -- seen anything?
17354/0:Hold still!
17354/1:I can't believe I missed!
17355/0:The reception area's at the front of the main building.
17356/0:Me?  (grunt)  Protection.
17357/0:Seen anything suspicious?
17358/0:I can't connect!
17358/1:Next time, you're really going to feel it.
17359/0:
17360/0:Seen anything suspicious?
17361/0:I can't connect!
17361/1:Next time, you're really going to feel it.
17362/0:Seen anything suspicious?
17363/0:I can't connect!
17363/1:Next time, you're really going to feel it.
17364/0:Seen anything suspicious?
17365/0:The next one will find it's mark.
17365/1:That was a warning shot.
17366/0:What about the situation in the Inclinator?
17367/0:This unexpected change is great news for the citizens of Old Cairo who had grown accustomed to the permanent haze which was suspected by many to be the cause of the higher incidence of certain diseases in the medina.
17368/0:What's the matter?  Never learn to talk street?
17369/0:We'll try to overlook your betrayal at the Mako facility if you help us find Dr. Nassif.  She comes from a poor family in this plague-stricken village.  Billie Adams will be coordinating the investigation from the mosque that lies between the arcology and the village.  Report to her at once.
17370/0:You're a touch more irreverent than your brother, JC.  I like that.  Yes, you would be compensated.
17371/0:That's twice you've sided with the Templars.  Guess you're a lost cause.  If I can't persuade you, I'll have to kill you.  See you shortly.
17372/0:It's a hard time for the Church, but this is when Her Holiness needs your support.  Tell her your concerns.  She will put your mind at ease.
17373/0:A lotta misery in this world.  Doesn't take a philosopher to see that.
17374/0:I am serious.  Take a weapon mod.
17375/0:I'm thinking it over.
17376/0:Leave.
17377/0:At least one trainee besides me reported to the authorities.  Have you seen Leo?
17378/0:I'm on someone's trail -- seen anyone?
17379/0:The next one will find it's mark.
17379/1:That was a warning shot.
17380/0:I will take my case all the way to WTO High Command if I have to.
17381/0:Now watch the ceiling while I cut the power.
17382/0:I'm on someone's trail -- seen anyone?
17383/0:The next one will find it's mark.
17383/1:That was a warning shot.
17384/0:I'm on someone's trail -- seen anyone?
17385/0:(grunt)
17385/1:(grunt)
17385/2:(grunt)
17386/0:Do you think this is really going to work?  Turning their own tech against them?
17387/0:I'm on someone's trail -- seen anyone?
17388/0:(grunt)
17388/1:(grunt)
17388/2:(grunt)
17389/0:Strange.  Any ideas?
17390/0:(grunt)
17390/1:(grunt)
17390/2:(grunt)
17391/0:Strange.  Any ideas?
17392/0:Enough of this hide and seek.
17392/1:I can't get a clear shot.
17393/0:Strange.  Any ideas?
17394/0:Enough of this hide and seek.
17394/1:I can't get a clear shot.
17395/0:Strange.  Any ideas?
17396/0:Enough of this hide and seek.
17396/1:I can't get a clear shot.
17397/0:Check around over there.
17397/1:Take a look over that way.
17397/2:I think something's going on over there.
17398/0:I can't see him...
17398/1:Where did he go?
17399/0:Check around over there.
17399/1:Take a look over that way.
17399/2:I think something's going on over there.
17400/0:I can't see him...
17400/1:Where did he go?
17401/0:Her Holiness is dead!  This is a generated image.
17402/0:Did they destroy it or just move it?
17403/0:We have our differences.  Maybe I care a little more about some things -- purity of the soul and all that.  But that doesn't mean we can't get along.
17404/0:You will appreciate our merchandise.  You are a welcome customer, having helped us in the past.  Perhaps you can offer your services once more.
17405/0:At this rate, they're going to need to hire someone full time for PR.
17406/0:I'm not answering any questions until you tell me who YOU are.
17407/0:And that's why you almost killed Her Holiness, the spiritual leader of half the world?
17408/0:The Age of Light is at hand.
17409/0:Isn't the Pequod's in the arcology closed?
17410/0:If they would only open their eyes...
17411/0:Just let us know.
17412/0:With a few post-natal recombinations, yes.  But our work has moved away from clones...
17413/0:I'm not going anywhere near that lab.
17414/0:Check around over there.
17414/1:Take a look over that way.
17414/2:I think something's going on over there.
17415/0:I can't see him...
17415/1:Where did he go?
17416/0:
17417/0:Check around over there.
17417/1:Take a look over that way.
17417/2:I think something's going on over there.
17418/0:I can't see her...
17418/1:Where did she go?
17419/0:Nope.
17419/1:Haven't noticed a thing.
17419/2:Nothing unusual here.
17420/0:I can't see her...
17420/1:Where did she go?
17421/0:Miss Withers called me herself.  So.  You prevailed.
17422/0:The students are fortunate that Archer's plans were uncovered... but my family is far from safe.
17423/0:Nope.
17423/1:Haven't noticed a thing.
17423/2:Nothing unusual here.
17424/0:I can't see her...
17424/1:Where did she go?
17425/0:Nope.
17425/1:Haven't noticed a thing.
17425/2:Nothing unusual here.
17426/0:Yeah, you better run away.  Ha!
17426/1:Come back here!
17427/0:Nope.
17427/1:Haven't noticed a thing.
17427/2:Nothing unusual here.
17428/0:Yeah, you better run away.  Ha!
17428/1:Come back here!
17429/0:How's it going?
17429/1:How are you?
17430/0:Yeah, you better run away.  Ha!
17430/1:Come back here!
17431/0:And what would you propose?
17432/0:How's it going?
17432/1:How are you?
17433/0:He's on the run!
17433/1:Look at him go!
17434/0:How's it going?
17434/1:How are you?
17435/0:He's on the run!
17435/1:Look at him go!
17436/0:If you absolutely must leave the arcology structure, wear appropriate protective gear and return to a sealed area as soon as possible.  
17437/0:How's it going?
17437/1:How are you?
17438/0:He's on the run!
17438/1:Look at him go!
17439/0:What's in Trier?
17440/0:Well, it makes no nevermind to ME, but I have a proposal.  This jet carries two Sunfire missiles.  I could take out the ground force of any group you tell me.
17441/0:Yeah, good for me and good for you, too -- if you were smart and put your money on the Snake.
17442/0:Filthy Seekers.
17443/0:I'd really like to see it.
17444/0:You're investigating this ApostleCorp for patent infringement?
17445/0:
17446/0:... that bot...
17447/0:She been in many fights?
17448/0:Someone went after this bot, but didn't quite finish the job.
17449/0:... the lights...
17450/0:Hmmm... The lights are on.
17450/1:It should be dark in here.
17451/0:I spend many hours a day hear, listening to the wise words of Her Holiness.
17452/0:Hmmm... The lights are off.
17452/1:It shouldn't be dark in here.
17453/0:...making tomorrow look like yesterday...
17454/0:... the door...
17455/0:The door's been wrecked.
17455/1:Someone really wanted to get in.
17456/0:May Her Holiness watch over you.
17457/0:How did that happen?
17457/1:Something -- or someone -- must be creeping around.
17458/0:It's missing.
17458/1:It's gone.
17459/0:How terrible.  He'd escaped the Templar encampment only to meet his end here.
17460/0:Hi.
17460/1:Hey there.
17461/0:She's on the run!
17461/1:Look at her go!
17462/0:Hi.
17462/1:Hey there.
17463/0:She's on the run!
17463/1:Look at her go!
17464/0:Hi.
17464/1:Hey there.
17465/0:She's on the run!
17465/1:Look at her go!
17466/0:Hi.
17466/1:Hey there.
17467/0:Pretty poor aim there, sport.
17467/1:Good thing for me your aim is terrible.
17468/0:Doesn't this stuff with the Order just burn you up?
17468/1:Wanna get together later?
17469/0:Pretty poor aim there, sport.
17469/1:Good thing for me your aim is terrible.
17470/0:See ya later.
17471/0:Doesn't this stuff with the Order just burn you up?
17471/1:Wanna get together later?
17472/0:Pretty poor aim there, sport.
17472/1:Good thing for me your aim is terrible.
17473/0:Doesn't this stuff with the Order just burn you up?
17473/1:Wanna get together later?
17474/0:Biomods...  great...
17474/1:Whoa -- this one's a freak -- biomods.
17475/0:Doesn't this stuff with the Order just burn you up?
17475/1:Wanna get together later?
17476/0:Biomods...  great...
17476/1:Whoa -- this one's a freak -- biomods.
17477/0:Stop your attacker with a stun prod, an electromagnetic boltcaster, a pistol, dual-action shotgun, or SMG machine gun.
17478/0:Don't think so.
17478/1:Try someone else.
17479/0:Biomods...  great...
17479/1:Whoa -- this one's a freak -- biomods.
17480/0:Don't think so.
17480/1:Try someone else.
17481/0:I guess I can do it, when push comes to shove.
17482/0:The medina needs a dating service, the whole Nanite Swell 11 region.
17483/0:The lady can pick her gobs...
17484/0:Just go to the entrance to the terraformer bay and I'll transmit the code.
17485/0:
17485/1:
17485/2:
17485/3:
17486/0:That's not where that's supposed to be.
17486/1:Someone's been moving things around.
17487/0:Hey.  I was talking to you.
17488/0:Took some damage here.
17488/1:Hmmm... damage...
17489/0:Hmmm.... it's been destroyed.
17489/1:... some serious damage...
17490/0:It's gone haywire.
17490/1:Someone may have tampered with that.
17491/0:Hmmm... Shut down.
17491/1:Someone may have disabled that.
17492/0:Hm, that's supposed to be on...
17493/0:Move along.  I know you have your orders and I have mine.  Now let me do my job.
17494/0:Hm, that isn't supposed to be on...
17495/0:Hm, that's supposed to be closed...
17496/0:Hm, that's supposed to be open...
17497/0:Clever ploy.
17498/0:I don't know who -- or what -- you are, but you aren't permitted here.
17499/0:A toxic spill shut down the inclinator system early this morning. 
17500/0:No one told me anything about an attack.  How bad is it?  I have friends in Chicago.
17501/0:I know.
17502/0:I guess I can do it, when push comes to shove.
17503/0:I guess I can do it, when push comes to shove.
17504/0:What's your problem?
17504/1:Sheesh.
17505/0:Look at us!  We're taking care of business.
17506/0:What's your problem?
17506/1:Sheesh.
17507/0:Look at us!  We're taking care of business.
17508/0:What's your problem?
17508/1:Sheesh.
17509/0:Look at us!  We're taking care of business.
17510/0:What's your problem?
17510/1:Sheesh.
17511/0:Just gotta hang in there.
17512/0:Well, fuel's burnin'.
17513/0:We are fortunate to live in an era such as this.
17514/0:I've had enough.
17514/1:I don't need any more of this today.
17515/0:Just gotta hang in there.
17516/0:I have decided.  I will be one of these missionaries.
17517/0:I've had enough.
17517/1:I don't need any more of this today.
17518/0:Just gotta hang in there.
17519/0:I wonder where they really are....
17520/0:I've had enough.
17520/1:I don't need any more of this today.
17521/0:We're holding our own.
17522/0:I've had enough.
17522/1:I don't need any more of this today.
17523/0:We're holding our own.
17524/0:My foster parents.
17525/0:As I suspected.  You are far from loyal to Mr. Dumier, aren't you?  Read that document carefully.  It shows just how deep the Illuminati's deception runs.  The poor soul who runs the coffeeshop would undoubtedly be grateful if you told him how he has been misused.
17526/0:This shouldn't take too long.
17526/1:(sigh) I'm reduced to a pest exterminator.
17526/2:Easy prey.
17527/0:No more games.
17527/1:Now we'll see who got the most out of training.
17527/2:I've been waiting for this.
17528/0:At least it's not the usual target.
17528/1:Interesting... but I'll have to destroy it nonetheless.
17529/0:(sigh) ... Greasel...
17530/0:Sandy.  Right, but a captain's gotta sail if he wants to keep his ship.
17531/0:(sigh) ... Greasel...
17532/0:(sigh) ... Karkian...
17533/0:(sigh) ... Karkian...
17534/0:I used to live here and believe everything Dumier said, until I realized that enclaves do the real brainwashing -- convincing people it's a free market where everyone can succeed if they work hard enough, when in fact it's all controlled to keep the wealth in the hands of a select few.  I'm trying to wake them up.
17535/0:(sigh) ... Sentinel...
17536/0:Selfish scum.
17537/0:Deja vu.
17537/1:Time to stop teasing my prey and get this finished.
17537/2:I tried to let you off easy.
17537/3:Back for more?  Fool.
17538/0:You're clearly unprepared for this battle.
17538/1:You're in trouble now.
17539/0:What do you have?
17540/0:That is your prerogative.
17541/0:Vmail sender replied:
17542/0:So do you need a lift?  I was in Cairo looking for someone, but he isn't here.
17543/0:Your interruptions are keeping me from my patients.
17544/0:My well-being, my life -- for a handful of credits.  What is this world coming to?
17545/0:I don't have time for this.
17545/1:Take your nonsense somewhere else.
17546/0:We're holding our own.
17547/0:By now you will have been told that you are the third Denton prototype.  That isn't quite true, or I wouldn't have been willing to destroy an entire city to kill you.
17548/0:I don't have time for this.
17548/1:Take your nonsense somewhere else.
17549/0:I'm gonna die!
17550/0:I don't have time for this.
17550/1:Take your nonsense somewhere else.
17551/0:I'm gonna die!
17552/0:I don't have time for this.
17552/1:Take your nonsense somewhere else.
17553/0:I'm gonna die!
17554/0:Hey -- watch where you're going.
17554/1:You bumped me!  Back off.
17555/0:We're cooked!
17556/0:Hey -- watch where you're going.
17556/1:You bumped me!  Back off.
17557/0:We're cooked!
17558/0:Hey -- watch where you're going.
17558/1:You bumped me!  Back off.
17558/2:How inconsiderate!
17558/3:You ran into me!
17559/0:We're cooked!
17560/0:Hey -- watch where you're going.
17560/1:You bumped me!  Back off.
17560/2:Sorry -- I must be in the way.
17560/3:Be careful where you're going.
17561/0:If it has to be this way...
17561/1:I'm going to do something about this.
17562/0:I never bet.  I just like to see 'em fight.
17563/0:Ouch!  Not funny.
17563/1:You're not making any new friends.
17564/0:If it has to be this way...
17564/1:I'm going to do something about this.
17565/0:Ouch!  Not funny.
17565/1:You're not making any new friends.
17566/0:If it has to be this way...
17566/1:I'm going to do something about this.
17567/0:Already tossed back a few pints.  May I say that I approve of your itinerary so far?
17568/0:No?
17569/0:I investigated the school, but I didn't know I was part of an official operation.
17570/0:All I want is a life in the arcology.  I don't care where I have to live.
17571/0:You're no match for me.
17571/1:I hope you have your affairs in order.
17571/2:(laughs) You're kidding, right?
17571/3:Don't worry, I'll make it quick.
17572/0:A helicopter followed you here.  Tracer Tong sent it to pick me up from Area 51 after my infiltration of MJ-12.  Ava Johnson was the pilot, an AI construct.  I'm putting her at your disposal.  Go back to the surface and meet her at the abandoned VersaLife base.
17573/0:(laughs)
17573/1:I've been waiting for this -- such a shame it will be over so quickly.
17573/2:I know all your tricks.  
17573/3:Let's see what you really got out of training.
17573/4:You have made a grave mistake.  It will be your last.
17573/5:You will regret this -- but not for long.
17574/0:With the commission we're getting, you guys can use them for lawn ornaments for all I care.
17575/0:Do tell me if you learn anything about the VIP area.
17576/0:Time to send in a drone.
17577/0:But when did you start using it?  Only after years of breathing this air, just like me.  We did not know any better.  Then by the time they started getting the word out, we were already sick.
17578/0:
17579/0:Fool.  You're only delaying the inevitable.
17579/1:Coward!
17579/2:You can't escape. (laughs)
17579/3:Pathetic.
17580/0:Stop hiding like a coward!
17580/1:Come out and fight.
17580/2:Fool.  You're only delaying the inevitable.
17581/0:Don't forget -- I've got some of the same systems.
17581/1:Mods can only take you so far, Alex.
17581/2:I know your biomodified tricks.
17582/0:(grunt)
17582/1:(grunt) Now you've really upset me.
17582/2:(grunt) That almost hurt.
17583/0:(yells)
17583/1:(grunt) Damn it.  I'm on fire.
17584/0:(groans)
17584/1:(moans)
17584/2:(groan) Toxin?  It will take more than that...
17585/0:
17586/0:
17586/1:
17586/2:
17586/3:
17587/0:Eddie wants to keep this quiet.
17588/0:Piezochem.... Medkits.  Respirators.  Bots for recovery and medical assistence.  Providing necessary products as we stand beside you in a difficult time.
17589/0:Amazing -- I almost turned into a crook over a month's dues.  I don't know what got into me.
17590/0:Wish I had the cash to get you a pilot.  [500]
17591/0:Ouch!  Not funny.
17591/1:You're not making any new friends.
17592/0:Stay true, young Pliable.  Now make sure that both Dentons have been killed, then step into JC Denton's machine inside the Statue so that the ducts will be primed with your nanite-capsid architecture.  My scientists will do the rest.
17593/0:Ouch!  Not funny.
17593/1:You're not making any new friends.
17594/0:What do you think Saman's plans are for her in the long run?
17595/0:Stop looking at me like that.
17595/1:We haven't met, now stop looking at me.
17596/0:Our work preparing the way for humanity is never done.
17597/0:Stop looking at me like that.
17597/1:We haven't met, now stop looking at me.
17598/0:Thanks.  I cannot wait to get out of here...
17599/0:Stop looking at me like that.
17599/1:We haven't met, now stop looking at me.
17599/2:Are you staring at me for a reason?
17600/0:Stop looking at me like that.
17600/1:We haven't met, now stop looking at me.
17600/2:Mind your own business.
17601/0:Stop acting like a freak.
17601/1:You're behaving like a fool.
17602/0:The Templars have taken the Mosque.  A handful of people may be trapped inside.  The paladins are indifferent to them, but the security bot will shoot any non-Templars.  If you eliminated the bot, the people could probably escape.
17603/0:Stop acting like a freak.
17603/1:You're behaving like a fool.
17604/0:Stop acting like a freak.
17604/1:You're behaving like a fool.
17604/2:I don't think you should be doing that...
17604/3:Oh my... What is going on here?
17604/4:Please stop doing that...I do not want to have to report you.
17605/0:You will be pleased with your purchase, I am sure.
17606/0:Stop acting like a freak.
17606/1:You're behaving like a fool.
17606/2:What are you doing?!
17606/3:We do have laws here, you know.
17607/0:No use complaining now.  That's not going to cure me.
17608/0:Who are you suing?
17609/0:
17610/0:We were a Versalife experiment, then JC came and helped us.  This one is here, away from all the ice, to help with lab works...  but then the Templars came.
17611/0:Good work.  Now I've got to get the troops ready for the transport.
17612/0:Well done.  Our enemies will become known to us.  Return to the medina for your compensation and to take advantage of the preferred customer discount you have just earned.
17613/0:(grunt) It will take more than that.
17613/1:(grunt) Not bad.  But I'm better.
17613/2:(grunt)
17614/0:(groan)
17614/1:(moans)
17614/2:(groan)
17615/0:(laughs)
17615/1:Take that!
17615/2:I'll try to make this quick and finish you off on with the next one.
17615/3:Can't you make this more of a challenge for me?
17616/0:Are you crazy?  You rode the Inclinator through the spill.
17617/0:Maybe I should try closing my eyes, since this is almost too easy otherwise.
17617/1:Another point for me!
17617/2:Aren't you even going to TRY?
17617/3:Another easy shot.
17618/0:(grunt)
17618/1:(grunt)
17618/2:(grunt)
17619/0:You should never have messed with me.
17619/1:Be more careful in choosing your opponents.
17620/0:Nothing, but I've got a girl waiting for me in Trier, Germany.  Protester-type.  She's there for the summit.
17621/0:No need for people to have the perception that we started these organizations for some other purpose.
17622/0:Of all people, you should have known better.
17622/1:I always knew I was a better soldier than you.
17622/2:(evil laughter)
17622/3:I never did understand why the techs were so excited about you.
17622/4:I guess your performances in the simulator didn't count for much.
17623/0:Then, talk to the woman in the air terminal information booth -- she works for us.  We will tell her that you are coming.  Say to her simply that you "have a friend in common."  Once inside the terminal, locate the armor and upload the schematic.  You will also find your cure.
17624/0:Victory.
17624/1:Triumph.
17624/2:Of course...
17624/3:That was too easy.
17625/0:Victory.
17625/1:Triumph.
17625/2:Of course...
17625/3:That was too easy.
17626/0:Someone in the arcology started that rumor so that we'd blame ourselves.
17627/0:That was fun -- too bad we can't play again. (crazy giggling)
17627/1:I knew you never had the knack for this.  
17627/2:What a waste...  Hard to believe that we're products of the same project.
17627/3:It won't be long, now that I've gotten rid of you.
17628/0:Before the... disruptions, Helios and I had many months of productive thought.  Up to now, all free societies have started with one premise: human nature is cruel, unjust -- a force to be controlled.
17629/0:That's the word from command.  Alex is their little sister, I guess.  Just as dangerous, though, if not more so.
17630/0:I guess you're right.  Through this door, take the hallway to the elevator at the other end.  It's busted, so you'll have to climb the ladder in the shaft to the top floor.  Miss Sak's office is up there.  And remember:  stay off the landing pad.
17631/0:If you'll excuse me now, I have work to do.
17632/0:With all that special training, you'd think you'd be able to sense when you were beginning to piss someone off.
17633/0:Very interesting, Alex.  Thank you.  I'm so glad I have a friend I can trust.  Testimony in a bribery case carries a customary reward.  Shall I transfer the funds?
17634/0:How do you plan to do that?
17635/0:Great work.  Both shoppers have made it to safety.
17636/0:Friend, let's not be too explicit.  Let me say simply that no war is without its battles.
17637/0:Sure you can stand up to crossfire from three directions?
17638/0:'Evening.
17639/0:I will not surrender...  unnnggh...
17639/1:I cannot be stopped...  (gasp)
17639/2:I... will... prevail...
17640/0:(groan)
17640/1:(grunt)
17640/2:Unggh.
17641/0:Ungh.
17641/1:Oomph.
17641/2:(grunt)
17642/0:(gasp)
17643/0:(yawn)
17643/1:(grrr)
17643/2:(argh)  
17643/3:(cough)
17643/4:(grunt)
17644/0:Not now!
17644/1:Back off -- I'm busy here.
17645/0:Maybe I could help if I knew who it was.
17646/0:Oh dear.
17646/1:Sorry.
17647/0:Try this.
17648/0:
17649/0:Incoming.
17650/0:Excuse me.  I have to get back to work.
17651/0:I doubt they care much about Plato one way or another.
17652/0:I'm Bud Puckett.  Remember me?
17653/0:As survivors flee the remains of the city, they wonder how or why this disaster could have happened.  It is now known that the damage was not caused by any sort of explosive or missile, but rather by an agent that seems to have dissolved, or even digested, the very substance of the buildings.  We still do not know who is responsible for this, but the totality of the destruction leads many to wonder whether this may signal yet the beginning of another Collapse, as experienced in 2052.
17654/0:You got a problem with how the first fight went down, talk to the bookie.  You can't win 'em all.
17655/0:If humanity is to have a future, it must be protected.  That is all we are trying to do.
17656/0:Splendid.  I will put in a good word.
17657/0:You better not rip me off.
17658/0:We work in secret only because it best serves our purpose.  
17659/0:I cannot wait to get some fresh air.
17660/0:I thought this SSC gig would just be some quick money... never expected to see action.
17661/0:You're gettn' kinda clingy, man.
17662/0:Almost... got... you...  
17662/1:You're in my sights.
17663/0:The defense of commercial districts has been the key to economic recovery since the Collapse.
17664/0:Is there a problem?
17665/0:Pick a fight up here, you're on your own, man.  I got us this job, and I plan to collect.
17666/0:Aha -- prox mine.
17667/0:That way.
17667/1:Over there.
17668/0:What's wrong?
17669/0:I haven't seen anything.
17669/1:Nothing unusual.
17670/0:Hi.
17670/1:Hey.
17671/0:Mech unit -- that's your target.  Go!
17671/1:Engage this objective.
17672/0:Utmost secrecy.  Heed us.
17673/0:Hi.
17673/1:(grunt)
17674/0:Mech unit -- that's your target.  Go!
17674/1:Engage this objective.
17675/0:Then be sure you talk to Chief Morgan as soon as you can.  She's in Europe right now, but she'll address you from the holocomm in her office.  Go up the stairs, hang a right, and look for the management wing on your left.
17676/0:You should watch where you're walking.
17676/1:You should pay more attention to where you're going.
17677/0:Mech unit -- that's your target.  Go!
17677/1:Engage this objective.
17678/0:Troopers will be dispatched immediately.
17679/0:Watch it.
17679/1:Your aim is worse than I thought.
17680/0:Can I help you?
17680/1:What are you looking at?
17681/0:Are you feeling okay?
17681/1:You really should take this more seriously.
17682/0:You would do well to rethink that course of action.
17682/1:I don't recommend following through with that.
17683/0:Give me the black-market biomod.  [1000]
17684/0:Well, thanks for the credits.  I better be going.
17685/0:I think you took a wrong turn somewhere.  
17686/0:Step over to one of the flight-bay windows.  Look at that wasteland.  Imagine if you were responsible for rebuilding an economic system to accommodate a planet full of beggars.  Not as simple as it might seem to people on the outside.
17687/0:Which one is it?
17688/0:Utmost secrecy.  Heed us.
17689/0:Since when does an ancient secret society set up a recruiting booth in the mall?
17690/0:I wouldn't ask too many questions if I was you.
17691/0:We know you're a person and we respected your privacy as much as we could.  We were only gathering data.
17692/0:
17693/0:Time to call in the bots.
17693/1:I'm summoning a bot.
17694/0:Live it up.  Someone from SSC will be running you off shortly.
17695/0:Time to call in the bots.
17695/1:I'm summoning a bot.
17696/0:Some people are still afraid to come out.  But I don't need fancy sensors to tell me that the air's clean.
17697/0:Time to call in the bots.
17697/1:I'm summoning a bot.
17698/0:I'm going to need a med bot.
17699/0:Didn't you get the message when I killed Paul?  If I bring the system up, it won't be for the Templars.
17700/0:I ran across some Templars in the apartment building across from the mosque.  Maybe they're the assault team.
17701/0:This area is off-limits.  
17701/1:Move along.
17702/0:I'm going to need a med bot.
17703/0:Are the leaders planning to hold a press conference or anything?
17704/0:That's really enough.
17704/1:You don't want to make me angry.
17705/0:I'm going to need a med bot.
17706/0:Are you trying to start something?
17706/1:I don't take kindly to invasions of my personal space.
17707/0:I'm summoning a repair bot for this.
17708/0:You should know better than to try to start something with me.
17708/1:If you're looking for a real fight, you're going to get one.
17709/0:I'm summoning a repair bot for this.
17710/0:Stop staring at me.  Now.
17710/1:I hardly find your glare intimidating.
17711/0:I'm summoning a repair bot for this.
17712/0:Tarsus may have something to worry about, but you and I should be just fine if it's what I think it is.
17713/0:Stop with this foolishness.
17713/1:You're really trying my patience with this nonsense.
17713/2:It won't be so funny if I lose my temper.
17714/0:Looks like a job for a military mech unit.
17715/0:I doubt you are ready to deal with the consequences of these threats.
17715/1:I do not take such threats lightly.
17716/0:And you are a Tarsus lady?  Yes?  Well, perhaps you can have a word with the headmaster.  I will give you my parental code: 74652.  Tarsus is on Level 107.  Tell the fat bum I want him to return my calls.  Where is my girl?  Why couldn't Leila find her last night?
17717/0:They will pay for their trespassing.
17718/0:I'm interested in contacting her.  I was told that I could find her here.
17719/0:Payment please.
17720/0:Was I not clear?  Get lost.
17720/1:I will personally restrict you from this area if necessary.
17721/0:If I stand by Her Holiness, perhaps we can put an end to these rumors.
17722/0:I'm not above using force.  Far from it.
17722/1:Get out of here!
17723/0:You're just about to push me too far.
17723/1:I've had it with you.
17723/2:This is your last warning.  Be careful or else you'll to pay the price.
17724/0:He said he'd meet you at your penthouse in an hour.  He seemed disappointed that I'm not your new chamber-boy.
17725/0:That must be a maintenance building.  Maybe you can learn something from one of the civilian employees inside.
17726/0:Without Mina?  Oh, I don't know if I could.  I hope you killed whoever it was that got her.
17727/0:Yes -- I talked to Tracer Tong.  He says that Her Holiness is being held by the Templars.
17728/0:Now c'mon -- you know Jennifer earned those scores honestly.  That Nassif, though, she's a weirdo.
17729/0:Yeah...  They're just worried about those two who went missing.  Me?  I don't really care one way or the other.  Just means less competition for me.
17730/0:A foolish mistake.  I've put ApostleCorp's plans in great jeapardy.
17731/0:Looks like a job for a military mech unit.
17732/0:
17733/0:Looks like a job for a military mech unit.
17734/0:Fall back!
17734/1:Retreat!
17735/0:WTO is getting nervous after all that's going on in Seattle.
17736/0:Fall back!
17736/1:Retreat!
17737/0:I'd appreciate it if you'd refrain from acting like that. // caustic
17737/1:Are you quite finished? //sarcastic
17738/0:Fall back!
17738/1:Retreat!
17739/0:My brother was the one who insisted on working in the field.  I was going to put him on an admin track here at the office.
17740/0:What the --
17740/1:Good God!
17741/0:Circle the enemy!
17742/0:What took so long?  I'm fallin' asleep out here.
17743/0:The assumption is that Leila got away.  We never found her body.
17744/0:Hm.  Some kind of movement...
17744/1:I saw SOMETHING...
17745/0:Circle the enemy!
17746/0:I see you!  // threatening
17747/0:Circle the enemy!
17748/0:This Summit has brought our leader right into the hands of the enemy.
17749/0:If Her Holiness thinks she can put us all into a great pre-Collapse wealth-making machine, she must think she's a god.
17750/0:You there.  Hey!
17751/0:Pin him down!
17752/0:Oh... I was hired to clean the system out.  The spiderbots haven't really been getting the job done.
17753/0:Huh.  My ears aren't what they used to be.
17753/1:I heard SOMETHING...
17754/0:
17755/0:Pin him down!
17756/0:Hey, whatever it takes to get these lunatics working for US.
17757/0:Hm, bumped into something...
17758/0:(grunt) Hell, I'm bein' AMBUSHED!
17758/1:(grunt) Who's there?!  You better stand down.  
17759/0:From Area-51.  My parents always said we were from Palm Springs.  So is JC Denton here?  Is that who you're protecting?
17760/0:Seen that one before...
17760/1:You might've gotten away with that against a rookie...
17761/0:Speak with Chief Morgan or get lost.  We don't have time for this.
17762/0:That's blood all right.
17763/0:(Cough cough) I just don't know how much longer I can wait.  
17764/0:Go away.
17765/0:Let's see how many I can get with a prox mine.
17766/0:But how?
17767/0:Helios is simply the natural evolution of consciousness.  The AI and I agree on how best to use each other's abilities.
17768/0:That's right.  You're dancin' with 'Zilla.  Come on, baby, you know the step!
17769/0:Pin him down!
17770/0:Pin her down!
17771/0:Pin her down!
17772/0:Why does everyone seem so edgy around here?
17773/0:Pin her down!
17774/0:A utopia of human-machine superbeings...?  Sounds familiar.
17775/0:Hm.  Something crossed in front of the light.
17776/0:Slowly but surely... C'mon.
17776/1:We can do this... one inch at a time.
17777/0:Your murder of Paul Denton has prevented us from testing the procedure, however.  My people don't trust you, so expect resistance from my paladins until you prove yourself.  It would be foolish of us to take your word for anything.
17778/0:Can I just take a peek at that hangar?
17779/0:Must've been a standoff here.
17779/1:The fighting seems to have tapered off.
17780/0:Slowly but surely... C'mon.
17780/1:We can do this... one inch at a time.
17781/0:Slowly but surely... C'mon.
17781/1:We can do this... one inch at a time.
17782/0:Fire, probably some sort of diversion.
17782/1:Someone's setting fires...
17783/0:Charge!
17783/1:Move in -- NOW!
17784/0:What seems like victory might be simply the first stage of your defeat.
17785/0:Something must be burning.
17786/0:Charge!
17786/1:Move in -- NOW!
17787/0:The defense of the compound is in your hands.  If you can hold the facility, and if my mission is a success, we should be ready to begin our offensive against WTO enclaves by the end of the month.
17788/0:Someone killed a mutant.
17789/0:Charge!
17789/1:Move in -- NOW!
17790/0:It's just a handful of rejects that badmouth the Charter System.
17791/0:Shutterbug's a cage-fed housecat, in my opinion.  House should be giving her odds.  But it's your money.  
17792/0:Some sort of commotion...
17793/0:That damage looks recent.
17794/0:Hm.  Completely destroyed.
17795/0:Hm.  Malfunctioning...
17796/0:Thank you.  I'd almost given up hope.  This morning I lost my daughter to the plague.  And today was to be her first day at the Tarsus school.  Thank you for helping to get her admitted -- we were so happy.  Oh!  (sob)  I was here to claim the body when the Templars attacked.
17797/0:Paladins have been instructed to hold their fire against you.
17798/0:You just restored power to the experimental device on the lower level.  Good -- you're thinking ahead.  But you'll have to come back later to bring it online.  We don't know enough about it yet.
17799/0:
17800/0:You lack the flaws of the previous revs, JC and Paul.
17801/0:Unfortunately, yes.  He has taken the Order's respect for Nature and warped it into fanaticism.  His quest for "Purity" is just a euphemism for the extermination of modified individuals.
17802/0:Wow.  Twenty years and no one's touched 'em.
17803/0:Hey, yo, outta here.  Now.
17804/0:People come to the old city to find the black market.  Is that why you risk getting infected?
17805/0:I took care of the zoning.
17806/0:Freak!
17806/1:Disgusting abomination!
17806/2:Welcome to purity.
17806/3:Fie!
17806/4:Yes!
17807/0:Who would attack a school?
17808/0:Freak!
17808/1:Disgusting abomination!
17808/2:Now we will see purity.
17808/3:Die, you unholy worm.
17808/4:Let blood and bone flow!
17809/0:Freak!
17809/1:Disgusting abomination!
17809/2:Try it, little freak.
17809/3:Do I look afraid to you?
17809/4:You look worried.
17810/0:So I'm on my own.
17811/0:Prepare to meet your doom!
17811/1:Fool!
17811/2:By Sidon, I'll destroy you!
17812/0:Prepare to meet your doom!
17812/1:Fool!
17812/2:By Sidon, I'll destroy you!
17813/0:I have decided.  I will be one of these missionaries.
17814/0:Prepare to meet your doom!
17814/1:Fool!
17814/2:By Sidon, I'll destroy you!
17815/0:This is too simple!
17815/1:You should have known better.
17816/0:How do you mean?
17817/0:They've got to be stopped.  Their main objective was to capture Paul Denton from Apostlecorp's lab here in the arcology, which they succeeded in doing.  We have intel that he's being held in Flight Bay 24.
17818/0:This is too simple!
17818/1:You should have known better.
17819/0:This is too simple!
17819/1:You should have known better.
17820/0:Not going to let you by this time, Alex.  I didn't know you were so squeamish about combat, until I saw how you handled Antarctica.  You hardly even scratched me and just ran and hid!  This time we'll finish it.
17821/0:It won't be long now before you meet your end, freak.
17821/1:Your debasement of humankind ends here.
17822/0:Alex, if you're trying to get to Lower Seattle, you're stuck. That toxic spill needs to be cleaned up before the Inclinator can be reactivated.  No one there seems equal to the task.  The WTO would certainly appreciate it if you could help out.
17823/0:I talked to Chairman Dumier and he gave me the key.
17824/0:
17824/1:
17824/2:
17825/0:Thanks.  I'm just glad things are working out for you.  Keep your head down.
17826/0:The canisters will transfer seed populations of nanites into subregions of your body.  You will need to configure each subpopulation for a specific skill.  For instance, the actin drivers in your legs can either increase your speed or quiet your footsteps -- not both.
17827/0:Don't worry -- Paul's safe.  I've already taken care of the situation.
17828/0:A failed corporation named VersaLife.  The Omar have learned much from the VersaLife laboratories abandoned after the Collapse.  Shall we conduct business?
17829/0:The woman you called Her Holiness was the daughter of the Illuminatus Beth DuClare.  She founded the Church after the Collapse as a foothold to regaining power.
17830/0:Thank goodness my daughter is safe, at least for now.  Because of you, she was able to escape the arcology just in time.
17831/0:Dissent within the church grows daily.  I'm not the only one questioning Her Holiness.
17832/0:
17833/0:The Luminon will give you your next assignment.
17834/0:It won't be long now before you meet your end, freak.
17834/1:Your debasement of humankind ends here.
17835/0:It won't be long now before you meet your end, freak.
17835/1:Your debasement of humankind ends here.
17836/0:I've got to find someone to take on this job.  We're stuck until that nanoformer gets repaired.
17837/0:Let's finish her off.
17838/0:Let's finish her off.
17839/0:Let's finish her off.
17840/0:You have been conditioned by this society.  You suffer from vasana -- You are too attached to the superficial and the material.  Turn away from this false sense of self-limitation to know your true self.  
17841/0:Let's finish him off.
17842/0:Let's finish him off.
17843/0:Let's finish him off.
17844/0:She won't last much longer.
17845/0:She won't last much longer.
17846/0:It is hard to put up with this sometimes.
17847/0:Hey, buddy, you're starting to give me the creeps.
17848/0:Get out of here, you freak.
17849/0:That sounds like it's from Mark Finley, Seattle's Minister of Culture.  Now why would he be talking to Nassif about hiding a shipment?   Is Tarsus involved in some sort of smuggling operation?  Come to the holocom so we can talk.
17850/0:
17851/0:Toward oneness.  Toward union with earth and spirit.  Toward inmost Order.
17852/0:One of the trainers, probably.  Greedy scabs -- they're the real animals in my book.  So what's your bet?  Snake-eyes challenging the Claw.  Four-to-one against Snake-eyes.
17853/0:As the Templars unveil their plans and their alarming influence and strength, the world waits to see what this work may entail.
17854/0:Maybe I can help get you out of here.
17855/0:Miss Cutie-pie gave me ten minutes to clear out.  She had my WTO citizenship revoked, too -- just like that!  I'm ruined!  Damn you mercenaries!
17856/0:She won't last much longer.
17857/0:Not much is open in this neighborhood this late.
17858/0:He won't last much longer.
17859/0:He won't last much longer.
17860/0:"What the hell?"  What kind of assignment do you expect with that attitude?
17861/0:He won't last much longer.
17862/0:Your actions in Antarctica prove you're honorable and you keep your word.  I've realized that we've known each other too long to let others order us to assassinate each other.  I'm supposed to keep this area secure, and I intend to take down anyone else who comes by, but you're free to go, Alex.
17863/0:Filthy beast!
17863/1:An affront to Nature.
17863/2:Ghastly!
17863/3:The true villain is the creator of these monsters...
17864/0:It is good to be returned.
17865/0:Filthy beast!
17865/1:An affront to Nature.
17865/2:Ghastly!
17865/3:The true villain is the creator of these monsters...
17866/0:Filthy beast!
17866/1:An affront to Nature.
17866/2:Ghastly!
17866/3:The true villain is the creator of these monsters...
17867/0:I'll put it out of its misery.
17868/0:Don't even think about coming in here.
17869/0:Well, fly with Sid all you want -- the money gets back to me one way or another.  He's a good pilot, especially for... non-traditional jobs, if that's what you're after.  It's worth the few extra credits for a good drop point.
17870/0:I'll put it out of its misery.
17871/0:Hey -- I'm a fan.  You're not supposed to argue with me.
17872/0:I'll put it out of its misery.
17873/0:As far as I'm concerned, it's not our problem.
17874/0:Sure.  Stand here as long as you want.  We're not doin' anything important.
17875/0:I guess we'll see if it was worth my time and effort.
17876/0:You mean...?
17877/0:The Templars have not said what they are going to do with us.
17878/0:The fumes hit me pretty bad.
17879/0:You can't hurt me.  My cause is just.
17879/1:You will have to try harder than that
17880/0:You can't hurt me.  My cause is just.
17880/1:You will have to try harder than that
17881/0:Chicago.  Someone put you on my tail?  You're a long way from home.
17882/0:You can't hurt me.  My cause is just.
17882/1:You will have to try harder than that
17883/0:Alex, you have made a poor decision.  I'm on the north dock.  Come talk to me and reconsider your actions.
17884/0:Sorry... Sometimes I just don't know when to stop talking.
17885/0:(groan)
17886/0:(groan)
17886/1:(groan) A small price for the sake of Purity.
17887/0:(groan)
17887/1:(groan) A small price for the sake of Purity.
17888/0:So some of your people have been recruited by the Templars.
17889/0:Don't think of him as your brother.  He was a clone just like you, the difference being that he has let his anger at his creators turn into megalomania.  He has made YOU into an experiment, remember, and next it will be the whole world, all of us living inside an ApostleCorp laboratory.  Say no, Alex.  For all of us.
17890/0:Gaaaah!  I'm on FIRE!
17890/1:(shriek)
17891/0:Gaaaah!  I'm on FIRE!
17891/1:(shriek)
17892/0:I do not believe she got kicked out -- We would have all heard about that by now.  It must be something else...  Maybe she is hiding...
17893/0:Gaaaah!  I'm on FIRE!
17893/1:(shriek)
17894/0:Ungh!  Poison!
17894/1:(grunt) Neurotoxin!
17895/0:Be there for us, Alex.  The critical time is approaching.
17896/0:You can do it with a nanite swell.  The particles absorb kinetic energy, which is then emitted as light.  By the time I arrived, though, the glow had subsided, so our choppers had no warning and crossed into the zone too quickly.
17897/0:
17898/0:No more waiting for the petty arguments and posturing of corrupt human beings.
17899/0:One of those "dodgy business owners?"
17900/0:
17901/0:
17902/0:When they are worthy, we will share our wisdom with them.  Until then, we must shield them.
17903/0:Then your ear bends to the Worldly-Wiseman, to continue the archaic analogy.  The smallest breeze carries you off Nature's straight and narrow path, which is ever eroded by the human lust for transcendence.
17904/0:Are you the specialist?  We've been waiting for hours for someone to solve the greasel situation.
17905/0:We didn't know.  Who would think that the air could eventually kill you?
17906/0:Ungh!  Poison!
17906/1:(grunt) Neurotoxin!
17907/0:Ungh!  Poison!
17907/1:(grunt) Neurotoxin!
17908/0:(grunt) I can't SEE!
17908/1:(grunt) I'm... BLINDED!
17909/0:There used to be laws about this sort of thing, but ever since the Collapse people do what they want.
17910/0:Yeah, you just move along there, young man.
17911/0:(grunt) I can't SEE!
17911/1:(grunt) I'm... BLINDED!
17912/0:My mistake.  Sorry.
17913/0:(grunt) I can't SEE!
17913/1:(grunt) I'm... BLINDED!
17914/0:Thanks, mister.
17915/0:(grunt) I will not succumb to you!  //weakly, choked
17915/1:(groan)
17916/0:(grunt) I will not succumb to you!  //weakly, choked
17916/1:(groan)
17917/0:Doesn't bother ME.  Only time I went up the Inclinator was when I got arrested.
17918/0:(grunt) I will not succumb to you!  //weakly, choked
17918/1:(groan)
17919/0:(groan)
17919/1:(groan) I've still got some fight in me.
17920/0:At least they got the helicopter on the ground with no problems.
17921/0:(groan)
17921/1:(groan) I've still got some fight in me.
17922/0:What he decides will affect how billions of people live for centuries to come, but like all people he has to contend with his own frailty and petty appetites.
17923/0:Hey, yo, get serious, y'all.  P's comin' any second.  Supposed to get busted out an hour ago.
17924/0:You're quite near the captured gray that their leader was talking about.  Save the poor creature, or the Templars will vivisect him to learn about the grays' vulnerabilities.
17925/0:I have heard rumors Her Holiness has special powers.  That has to be a myth.
17926/0:It's so sad that you believe all that.  I'll put you out of your misery.
17927/0:You have no idea how important this project is.  If you were in our position, you would see why it was critical to monitor your progress.
17928/0:I managed all right.
17929/0:Scout's honor.
17929/1:I'm dead serious.
17929/2:Can't make up a rumor like that.
17929/3:Honest.  Just lookin' out for ya.
17930/0:
17931/0:Scout's honor.
17931/1:I'm dead serious.
17931/2:Can't make up a rumor like that.
17931/3:Honest.  Just lookin' out for ya.
17932/0:The last thing I need is more training.
17932/1:I'm gonna sue this time.  I mean it.
17932/2:What's wrong with the old uniforms?
17932/3:It's all about their public image.  Every time.
17932/4:But he was dead!
17932/5:They better not try to fire ME.
17933/0:The last thing I need is more training.
17933/1:I'm gonna sue this time.  I mean it.
17933/2:What's wrong with the old uniforms?
17933/3:It's all about their public image.  Every time.
17933/4:But he was dead!
17933/5:They better not try to fire ME.
17934/0:Just making the usual rounds.
17935/0:Uh, sorry.
17936/0:That's how it is sometimes.
17936/1:(sigh) That's just the breaks.
17936/2:I warned you.
17936/3:You should've seen it coming.
17937/0:We humans, though... we are very good at creating the supreme race, one tiny piece at a time.
17938/0:That's how it is sometimes.
17938/1:(sigh) That's just the breaks.
17938/2:I warned you.
17938/3:You should've seen it coming.
17939/0:(groan)
17939/1:(groan) I've still got some fight in me.
17940/0:To purity...
17940/1:Baphomet guide me now....
17941/0:Area returning to normal.
17942/0:Well!
17942/1:Goodness!
17943/0:His vision isn't easy to comprehend because he's operating on a higher level now.  We just have to trust his wisdom, and soon we'll all share in it.
17944/0:Oh dear!
17944/1:For God's sake!
17945/0:To purity...
17945/1:Baphomet guide me now....
17946/0:I'm on duty right now.
17947/0:Did I see something?
17948/0:To purity...
17948/1:Baphomet guide me now....
17949/0:So.  You let yourself be seen...
17950/0:(grunt)
17950/1:(grunt)
17951/0:(grunt)
17951/1:(grunt)
17952/0:I do not believe she got kicked out -- We would have all heard about that by now. It must be something else... Maybe she is hiding...
17953/0:(grunt)
17953/1:(grunt)
17954/0:Oomph!
17954/1:Nooo...  ungh.
17955/0:Oomph!
17955/1:Nooo...  ungh.
17956/0:Hey, Red, what're we gonna do about this guy?
17957/0:Oomph!
17957/1:Nooo...  ungh.
17958/0:I'm handling the SMG shipment for David Kurczec.
17959/0:Have faith.  This must be part of some greater order we cannot yet see.  
17960/0:I just think the world needs some organization.
17961/0:Rumor is that the craft was circling the city and not responding to WTO queries.
17962/0:SSC was not prepared to deal with this...
17963/0:
17964/0:Not really.  That so-called dating service ripped me off.
17965/0:I'll bet that your intruders are Billie Adams, along with some Templar back-up.  After that, I have no idea what you're talking about.
17966/0:
17967/0:Did I hear something?
17968/0:I think I felt something...
17969/0:(grunt) Who attacks me?
17969/1:(grunt) I will defend myself!
17970/0:That shadow moved...
17971/0:Hear that?  He called Red a "punk..."
17972/0:That's suspicious...
17972/1:Hmmm...
17973/0:So, as the leaders of two of the world's most influential and powerful organizations prepare to make history, they will not need to worry about security concerns.
17974/0:Let's hear it.
17975/0:I feel like I'm being watched...
17975/1:Something just isn't right.
17976/0:The Harvester will discuss.  Okay?
17977/0:You could become a very powerful man, Alex.  With biomodification technology properly regulated, you would be the forerunner of a new elite.
17978/0:Surely, this must be a pattern...
17978/1:Now what?  Hmmm.
17979/0:I was wrong, perhaps.
17979/1:I'm being foolish.  It's nothing.
17980/0:Whoever it was must've left.
17980/1:Got away...
17981/0:Surely it was one of the test subjects...
17981/1:It must be Alex D...
17982/0:I'm talking about the Collapse.  The biggest depression in world history.  I guess you don't follow current events.
17983/0:Alex, I've been sent to pick you up.  The signal from the beacon will let me land near the VersaLife facility, but first you must speak to JC.  I will circle the area until it's time to land.
17984/0:
17984/1:
17984/2:
17984/3:
17985/0:Good day.
17986/0:You aren't my assassin until I'm dead.
17987/0:The landing pad is off-limits.
17988/0:That's a pretty serious accusation.  Do you have proof?
17989/0:What I really hate are the negative ads, where they say QueeQueg's exploits workers and has germs in its product.
17990/0:I've got to stop worrying about them.  I really need to stay focused on my studies.
17991/0:You're one of them.  I can tell from your eyes.
17992/0:Tarsus gave us a lot.  Maybe we owe them a chance to explain.
17993/0:There's nothing back here for civilians, just a bunch of maintenance and custodial stuff.
17994/0:Maybe I'll check back with you later tonight.
17995/0:I'd sure like to put an end to this rampage!  (growl)  // giving up
17996/0:Have faith in the Order.  All will be well.
17997/0:Guess the murderer will live to kill another day...
17998/0:Robbed... Gah!
17999/0:I should look into this...
17999/1:Could be trouble...
18000/0:This is very peculiar.
18000/1:I sure hope it's nothing...
18001/0:We appreciate your resourcefulness in seeking us out, as well as your warnings via our friend Leo regarding the Templar raid.  
18002/0:Now you're talkin'.  I'll meet you there.
18003/0:Goodness!  What do I do?
18003/1:Oh my!
18004/0:We're going to need some extra cover for the shipment next week.  
18005/0:How much did I win?
18006/0:I won't stand for this!
18006/1:Enough!
18007/0:Oh!
18007/1:What the--!
18008/0:I can stand up for myself!
18008/1:Fool!  Now you will pay the price!
18009/0:I'm tired of this!
18009/1:This time you won't get away!
18010/0:
18011/0:The nanites actually began disintegrating him from the inside.  They put him in cryostate so that they could find a cure.
18012/0:I never turn a customer away.  I think that's my prerogative as an entrepreneur.
18013/0:Just kill him and my people in the morgue will remove the components I need.  I like how you think.  You will be well paid.  [300 credits.]  Here, you will need this pass to enter the arcology.
18014/0:Activating the Inclinator doesn't solve any of our problems right now.
18015/0:I don't think so.  Just get me there.
18016/0:Dr. Nassif said to carry on like normal and wait for an extraction.
18017/0:
18018/0:That's right, you arrived and you're still there.  I saw you myself -- the real NG Resonance -- and now you're dead.  In real life, you're a spoiled brat the world can do without.
18019/0:Listen:  I don't know exactly what they've all told you, but you're just a pawn.  And reviving an ancient, mad cyborg isn't going to help anyone.
18020/0:You don't have to worry about Leo Jankowski.
18021/0:I'll get back to you.
18022/0:Draw your weapon!
18023/0:I have failed to locate my passenger.  Where do you want to go?
18024/0:Steady, steady...
18025/0:That's what I just said.
18026/0:We will RUN to the greenhouse!  Hurry, before your grandfather hears you!
18027/0:I know you're here...
18027/1:Enough tricks!
18028/0:Face me, you coward!
18028/1:Afraid of a little old man?
18029/0:Nice try...  // sarcastic
18029/1:You don't even know how to aim your weapon.
18030/0:Get out of there!  You'll get hurt!
18031/0:(grunt)
18031/1:(grunt)
18032/0:(groan)
18032/1:(groan)
18033/0:This is an intellectual property matter.  It doesn't concern the Order.
18034/0:(moan)
18035/0:Huh?
18035/1:Eh?
18035/2:Oh?
18036/0:Want a tip?  Bet on Green Dragon.
18037/0:I need some firepower.  Give me the SMG.  [400]
18038/0:A spiritual movement about reconstituting the self, improving the self, finding balance with the world.  Her Holiness knows that no balance is possible if the old world returns -- global capital, teratogenic science, universal wage-slavery...
18039/0:At least YOU weren't here when they attacked.
18040/0:I feel a little dizzy.  (cough cough)
18041/0:Is something wrong?
18042/0:Good, that'll buy me a month or two until the Omar sneak another one into town.  Here's your money.
18043/0:No response yet from the Order.  Anti-WTO rioting broke out for the third time recently at the Panzerwerks factory in Trier.  Many blame Order agitators for the violence.
18044/0:(groan)
18044/1:(groan) Murdered by my own creation -- what a perfect farce!
18045/0:(gasp) (cough)
18045/1:(gasp) (cough)
18046/0:Here you go.
18047/0:Seattle and the WTO -- an exciting past and a glorious future.  Be proud, Seattle.  You are an example to the world.
18048/0:(scream)
18048/1:(scream)
18049/0:(groan) I can't see!
18050/0:Here and there you might find a survivor hiding behind automated security. but that's about it.
18051/0:Well, came through that all right.
18051/1:Just a scrape.  Sorry to disappoint.
18052/0:So you're modified?
18053/0:(groan)
18054/0:You must strive with your meditations to become a pandita.  Our hindu brothers originated this goal, that of becoming one who is liberated or self-aware.  Through this inward reflection, you can liberate yourself from chaos and disorder.
18055/0:(moan)
18056/0:Uh!
18057/0:(gasp)
18058/0:Your just reward...
18058/1:Excellent.
18059/0:Funny way to run an operation.  Wonder who'd hide out in a dumpster.
18060/0:The WTO is handling the situation now.  We've got bots patrolling, which I can't reprogram at this stage.  There's no way we can guarantee anyone's safety under these conditions.
18061/0:You made it in.  Now start searching her apartment.  Maybe there's a datacube or something...
18062/0:The Regional Director has been disappointed in my profits since the intensification of Nanite Swell 11.  I lose the shop if I can't find a way to impress him.
18063/0:Order be praised -- you have a strong will after all.  Those crooks have been trying to run us out of town.  Now take care of Sak so that she can't hire replacements.
18064/0:Thanks -- I promise not to break it.
18065/0:End of messages.
18066/0:Something breaks, I'm gonna have them dust that keyboard for fingerprints.
18067/0:If the human body is a sacred book-- then no organization has burnt more scripture than the Templars. 
18068/0:As far as I'm concerned, it's not our problem.
18069/0:Alex!  Stop -- I have something to tell you about Chairman Dumier.
18070/0:
18071/0:There's a new sheriff in town, in case you want to know.
18072/0:
18073/0:You are a Denton rev.  I am the latest rev 2.0.1a from the Xeta-Q gene line.  Perhaps our specs will converge in the next generation.
18074/0:Listen.  Her Holiness is speaking.
18075/0:I know how to use this thing!
18076/0:Sid Black.  Harrier pilot.  Best flyer in the Western Hemisphere.  I drop my birds on the curb.  Spread it around.  I've got a contract lined up after the summit, but I'm still available for local hops.
18077/0:(growl)
18077/1:Take that!
18078/0:Glad that's over...
18078/1:I refuse to suffer an ignoble death.
18079/0:What a disappointment that one turned out to be...
18079/1:A waste of our best ingenuity...
18080/0:I'm not giving up!
18080/1:Damn!
18080/2:I missed...
18081/0:Saman?  He's behind this?
18082/0:Not the first time I've had to defend myself...
18082/1:A man of my achievments doesn't die in a senseless brawl.
18083/0:I made you.  You owe everything to me...  // pleading
18083/1:Turn away from greed, Alex.  You were created for higher things.
18084/0:I think I could use someone like you in the novel I'm writing, a polished gem of a man broken loose from his fitting in society, half jewel, half stone.
18085/0:An interesting discovery.  So Dr. Nassif has a cousin at the Tarsus Academy in New Cairo.  The visitation pass will let you enter the school on Level 107 of the arcology.  Find the cousin, Eeva, and see if she leads you to ApostleCorp.
18086/0:Now for the decisive blow...
18087/0:Well --
18088/0:I'm embarassed to say your assault lacked elegance, Alex.  
18088/1:I was wrong.  You weren't all that advanced after all.
18089/0:(grunt)
18089/1:(grunt)
18090/0:I took care of the people guarding your jet.  You won't have any trouble taking it back.
18091/0:Your GEAR?  You're leaving?  Sid, you made me get this big place. Do you know how high my rent is?
18092/0:Cairo Arcology Chairman Chris Ubair has recently been accused of civil corruption. Investigators are looking into some of the Chairman's business dealings and the case has just been officially filed in court.  Beyond that, we have no further details at this time.
18093/0:Please return when you are no longer short of credits.
18094/0:
18095/0:Yeah?  What kind of equipment do you have?
18096/0:
18097/0:
18098/0:Good to have someone like you on our side.
18099/0:An eye for an eye...
18100/0:You memorize the phrase "separation of powers" in school, but in the beginning no one was exactly sure how to pull it off.
18101/0:Trust me.  Misunderstanding, ignorance, the charade of warring ideologies, war in any form -- all are already historical footnotes.
18102/0:I can't hit her!
18103/0:The Pit pays.  You'll find out.  Just stick with it.
18104/0:I can't hit her!
18105/0:It's not afraid of weapons...
18106/0:Which is why we had to do something.  The summit is useless.  We need to chase them out of Trier entirely.
18107/0:It's not afraid of weapons...
18108/0:Hey!  Where'd you go?
18108/1:Get back here!
18108/2:You can't fool an SSC officer that easily...  
18108/3:I'm going to search until I find you! (under breath) Or at least until my coffee break...
18108/4:This isn't cool.  If you're gonna fight, fight.
18109/0:If I wanted to be a detective, I wouldn't be working for the SSC.
18110/0:Always an alternative...
18110/1:Back to the underworld...
18110/2:Secrets are lives, yes indeed...
18110/3:Damn this uncertainty!
18110/4:Nothing left now but chance...
18111/0:Hey!  Where'd you go?
18111/1:Get back here!
18111/2:Don't run away -- you big baby.
18111/3:Are you still here?  You've got some explaining to do.
18111/4:Where'd you go?
18112/0:I just have to believe in Her Holiness.  Order WILL prevail.
18113/0:(yawn)
18113/1:(grrr)
18113/2:(cough)
18113/3:(clears throat)
18114/0:Maybe he took off...
18114/1:Hm.  I don't think he had time to get away...
18115/0:I was once an investment banker in the arcology, but now I teach yoga here in the medina.
18116/0:Really now...
18116/1:Just lovely.
18116/2:Hmm.  // annoyance.
18117/0:Maybe he took off...
18117/1:Hm.  I don't think he had time to get away...
18118/0:The Plan finally unfolds.
18119/0:With your systems, it's impossible that you could be such a klutz.
18119/1:Watch where you're going.
18119/2:Have a little respect.
18120/0:Maybe she took off...
18120/1:Hm.  I don't think she had time to get away...
18121/0:Don't look at me like that.
18121/1:I would expect better manners from one of our pupils.
18121/2:You're staring.
18122/0:Maybe she took off...
18122/1:Hm.  I don't think she had time to get away...
18123/0:None of that, please.
18123/1:I.... don't understand.
18123/2:Aren't we clever?
18124/0:I can't let you come this way.
18125/0:I won't allow myself to be threatened.
18125/1:Put that away.  I insist.
18126/0:Not me, you fool!
18126/1:Careful!
18126/2:Have you lost your mind?
18127/0:Enough.
18127/1:Don't try my patience.
18128/0:I only talked to Billie briefly in Seattle, but I could tell right away that something was off.
18129/0:
18130/0:
18131/0:It sounds like operations are going well.  Show those Omar beasts we will not tolerate their pollution.  And that's just the first step in our plans for this city.  Once the right people are running things, every citizen will wake up -- they'll finally see how important the battle for Purity really is.
18132/0:Seriously, watch out for the automated turrets.
18133/0:There he is.  Captain Lamar and the Templar fugitive appear to be having some sort of conference in the office overlooking the platform.  Find out what this is all about.
18134/0:
18135/0:Power itself is not evil, only the people who misuse it.
18136/0:That's why Eeva and Jennifer were hiding -- they'd found out about the Headmaster's plans for them.
18137/0:Guess we better take a look around.
18137/1:Keep an eye out.
18137/2:Keep a sharp lookout!  I think we're close...
18137/3:This is when it counts.  You better not bail on me this time.
18137/4:Any minute now... be ready!
18138/0:Guess we better take a look around.
18138/1:Keep an eye out.
18138/2:Look into all the nooks and cranies -- this is a slippery one!
18138/3:Pay attention.  I don't want any screw-ups.
18139/0:He's still here -- I can feel it.
18139/1:I bet he's hiding.
18139/2:He's ours... don't give up.
18139/3:He's not going to get away from the SSC!
18140/0:He's still here -- I can feel it.
18140/1:I bet he's hiding.
18140/2:We're gonna get him -- it's just a matter of time.
18140/3:I think we're right on top of him.
18141/0:She's still here -- I can feel it.
18141/1:I bet she's hiding.
18141/2:She's not going to get away from the SSC!
18142/0:Amen.
18143/0:Your fascination is justified, but I'm only the nanite engineer, not the architect of your genome.
18143/1:Yes, we have much to learn from each other, but please stop staring.
18144/0:She's still here -- I can feel it.
18144/1:I bet she's hiding.
18144/2:It's just a matter of time before we get her!
18144/3:I think we're right on top of her.
18145/0:Don't do that again.
18145/1:That was wholly unjustified!
18145/2:Hey, you injured me!
18146/0:You kill me, and you turn your back not just on ApostleCorp but on your own true destiny.
18146/1:Get that out of my face.  I mean it.
18147/0:What's going through your mind, young man?  Don't provoke me.
18148/0:What's going through your mind, young lady?  Don't provoke me.
18149/0:Leave this minute!
18150/0:I won't allow this!
18150/1:You will show some respect.
18150/2:Do as I say!
18151/0:Provoke me again and I will act!
18151/1:Consider this your last warning.
18151/2:That's it!  Cut it out!
18152/0:Please listen.  We must work together.
18152/1:I don't know what that was about, but we're nothing without each other's help.
18153/0:Not now!  Danger!
18153/1:Wait!  It's not safe!
18154/0:If I was a Templar assassin, I wouldn't stand around talking about it.
18155/0:I'm sure it means the apocalypse is coming, just like my aunt always warned.
18156/0:Great place to meet chicks, huh?
18157/0:What a day.
18158/0:Wherever you want to go.  I'll be right here.  [500 credits.]
18159/0:Leave Dr. Todd to his work.
18160/0:Word is leaking out that Her Holiness and I have been secretly working together.  I think we can spin that into "diplomatic ties."
18161/0:
18162/0:Just acting suspicious can get you in a lot of trouble around here.
18163/0:You talk like you knew JC personally.  Did you know him before the merger?
18164/0:I don't recommend going against a direct order from the Grand Master himself.  Besides, do YOU want to try to take on a modified Denton by yourself?
18165/0:Yeah, and lose some of our own in the process.  It's not worth it.  On the other hand, if we wait it out, they'll get nervous, do something stupid, and come to us.  Why waste our energy and resources when we can have it that way?
18166/0:You startled me there.  Guess I'm a little preoccupied.
18167/0:I met your manager.  Nice lady.
18168/0:I've got a score to settle with the Minister of Culture over there at the bar.  He stole my design for the sculpture in the Galleria.  So now I'm broke, my WTO dues are up, and I might get deported to Lower Seattle.
18169/0:I have to admit, I'm breathing a sigh of relief.  The troopers thought you were going to come in here and murder everyone.
18170/0:Faithful soldier, our objective is to recover the Aquinas Protocol specification from a computer on the lower level of UNATCO.  JC Denton's machine taps into the old Aquinas network.  Creating our own hub would let us use JC's machine for the opposite of its intended purpose.
18171/0:You're gone!
18171/1:Kneel and be blessed with a quick death!
18172/0:According to the intel I've got, the Templars have her pinned down inside this facility.
18173/0:Bot's on a rampage... I hate these things.
18174/0:You've got this coming...
18175/0:Aha!  Sorry yet for what you did?
18176/0:That's the one.  Get him!
18177/0:Didn't you get the message when I killed Paul?  If I bring the system up, it won't be for the Templars.
18178/0:Oh no!
18179/0:That's the one.  Get her!
18180/0:Hello.
18180/1:Hi, there.
18181/0:
18182/0:Sure, make a run at the Statue.  [1000]
18183/0:The interface with Ophelia, a new star in the sky.  The Eye that was prophesied.
18184/0:Yes, hello.
18184/1:Yes, how are you?
18185/0:Over there!
18186/0:Hel-lo-o...!  You know, they don't call us Seekers for nothing.
18187/0:I checked out the school.  No sign of your daughter, but I killed the headmaster.  He was only pretending to be a school administrator.
18188/0:I'm afraid I can't help you.
18189/0:What's that? //self-assured, somewhat bored
18189/1:Hm.
18190/0:That's odd.
18190/1:What's going on? // sarcastic
18191/0:That noise... seems out of place.
18191/1:I think I just heard something.
18192/0:Yes?  Do you have the password?
18193/0:Liberty in the abstract, or so I thought.  I was a reckless child back then, running a gang of revolutionaries.  We thought we loved freedom, but mostly we loved the sound of our own voices.
18194/0:I think I just saw something.
18194/1:What's that?  Out of the corner of my eye...
18195/0:A pretty face and a pretty voice.  It's funny, but they're worth more than the entire population of the slums outside the arcology walls.
18196/0:Again?  Now I'm curious.
18196/1:More?
18197/0:If the parent company is WTO-chartered, it probably isn't illegal.
18198/0:I've made some discoveries.  I think that you've brought me to the right place.
18199/0:My father's company has a lawsuit pending about the Nassif greenhouse.  Business is business, I guess.
18200/0:See?  Tactics and experience every time.  Claw must be ten years old, and he cooked the scales off that young buck.
18201/0:The Guardian grows weary.  She no longer believes in the Republic.
18202/0:It sure helps having a champ like 'Zilla.  It's our main draw.
18203/0:As the new by-laws are presented following this historic announcement, we will bring you the details as soon as possible.
18204/0:You see anything, you just take it down.
18204/1:This reminds me of that one time, y'know?  They always underestimate us.
18205/0:Watch out -- he could be anywhere.
18206/0:Right, I heard about your helicopter.  How'd you get this call past WTO security?
18207/0:Watch out -- she could be anywhere.
18208/0:Hey, I remember you.  We met in the vents at Tarsus, and you're the one who took care of Archer.  I owe you my life.
18209/0:That's weird.  // blank
18209/1:I don't get it. // blank
18210/0:I can't imagine what that was... //dripping with sarcasm
18210/1:I wonder what that might be...  //dripping with sarcasm
18211/0:What? //mildly interrogative
18211/1:Who? //mildly interrogative
18212/0:I don't like this.  //aggravated
18212/1:This doesn't look good. //aggravated
18213/0:I have a lot of fans at Tarsus!  I hope they come to my concert tomorrow...
18214/0:Oh my. //droll
18214/1:Oh no. //droll
18215/0:Blah blah blah -- It sounds great on paper, it gets you through school, but it doesn't work in the REAL world.  You should know the difference between theory and practice, Dr. Finnerman.
18216/0:If you must go out, respirators are recommended, especially for the elderly and for children. 
18217/0:I guess it's nothing to worry about. //casual
18217/1:Well, I won't bother myself about it. //casual
18218/0:You're no beauty queen yourself.
18219/0:I think that trespasser took off.
18220/0:I think I scared off that thug.
18221/0:How do you control human emotions?  Antidepressants?  Is that freedom?
18222/0:Looks like the thief fled.
18223/0:Looks like I've got the murderer on the run.
18224/0:First you must agree to abide by certain rules.  Number One -- membership is confidential.  You do not disclose the names of other members to ANYONE.  Understand?
18225/0:I heard they've already got a multi-million credit contract.
18226/0:People know not to try anything while the SSC is on watch.
18227/0:Mr. O'Rourke will pay.  He keeps his word.
18228/0:I'm sure you've already made a good first impression on Dr. Nassif.
18229/0:This is a Code Yellow health advisory.
18230/0:I'm serious.  I could give you the key to my back stairwell.  You could have drinks and hors d'oeuvres ready before we arrive.
18231/0:Shall we conduct business, or shall we wait until you examine the mutant?
18232/0:I think you'll like it here.  Just give the place a chance.
18233/0:I would expect as much, considering the hostile business climate.  Anyone get hurt earlier tonight during the bombing or whatever it was?
18234/0:You must have orders from Dr. Nassif.  You should probably get going.
18235/0:You won't get away with this!
18236/0:What do you think he'll do?
18237/0:YES -- I'm upset.  Leave me alone.
18238/0:Go ahead -- ask me to dance so I can tell you to shove off.
18239/0:I heard they've already got a multi-million credit contract.
18240/0:The Order is spiritually rich, but that doesn't buy many private aircraft.  Go to the Greasel Pit bar and let Sid Black know about his jet.  I bet he would agree to fly you to Mako.
18241/0:Not the brightest dude, are ya?
18242/0:Not the brightest girl, are ya?
18243/0:Get away from me!
18244/0:Was there nothing you could do??  We're all in danger now -- Panzerwerks has erupted into a riot just as Her Holiness arrived in Trier to try to soothe tensions between our church members and the factory's workers.
18245/0:
18246/0:I'd like to hear you explain how a city chairman can turn his back on thousands of people living on his city's doorstep.
18247/0:And they called it Aquinas.  That's about all I need to know.
18248/0:Don't let ApostleCorp or the Illuminati use you as a pawn.  One wants to worship JC and the other wants to try to control him.  Neither group can see he's too mad and too powerful for either.  I'm going to destroy him while he's still weak -- it's the only sane answer.  
18249/0:That bad?
18250/0:Right...  Where Leila went to school.  She helped her cousin get on the same track -- to a decent life.  Now we are targets.
18251/0:We may differ from your kind, but we do not deserve this caging.  We are not beasts to be used for science.
18252/0:Paul Denton?
18253/0:I could use a few EMP grenades.  Give me those.  [400]
18254/0:Is this Inclinator station under total lockdown?
18255/0:I feel like such a fool in this costume.
18256/0:I want to wipe out the Dentons.
18257/0:Here.  Take that biomod.
18258/0:The WTO handpicks cities for incorporation and citizens for membership.  These enclave citizens then choose the best suited among their number to lead them.  Such a system is immune from corruption.  My fellow Cairo citizens, you are my conscience -- I have always acted as you have demanded.
18259/0:We just need to accelerate our progress.  Checking out the greenhouse is definitely the way to go.
18260/0:Like killin'?  Huh?  Think you're bad?
18260/1:Yeah!  What goes around comes around...
18261/0:
18262/0:Now you did it.  I'm gonna be late for my manicure...
18262/1:Huntin' feeb.  I like it.
18263/0:Scrambler grenades -- give me those. [300]
18264/0:Unless somebody tells them.
18265/0:Sounds like you got mixed up with some bad people.
18266/0:I'm Ali Barin, President of Business Development.  Under any other circumstances, I would show you around.
18267/0:I'd move along if I were you.
18268/0:That's the word from command.  Alex is their little sister, I guess.  Just as dangerous, though, if not more so.
18269/0:You're right next to a vent shaft.  If you don't mind getting a little dirty, it can give you access to other parts of the laboratory and let you bypass security.
18270/0:What are you selling?
18271/0:
18272/0:
18272/1:
18272/2:
18272/3:
18272/4:
18273/0:
18274/0:Yes -- everything -- my kidnapping, the disabling of the gate...  He's taken a critical component from it, the Sequencing Module, to the Order Church in Rauchstadt, where his group is headquartered.  Once you get that module from him, you'll be able to use the gate.
18275/0:You better find somewhere else to loaf around.
18276/0:WTO incorporation seemed like a good idea fifteen years ago.
18277/0:Go ahead -- ask me to dance so I can tell you to shove off.
18278/0:... and don't come back!
18278/1:Must've got the message.
18279/0:How does it feel to be surrounded by enemies?
18280/0:... and don't come back!
18280/1:Must've got the message.
18281/0:That way!
18281/1:We probably should pursue, right?
18282/0:That way!
18282/1:We probably should pursue, right?
18283/0:Luminon Saman -- where are you?
18284/0:Archer's door is always open.
18285/0:The weasel's trying to get away.
18286/0:The weasel's trying to get away.
18287/0:I'll give you enough cash for a leather jacket.  Just don't hurt me. [100]
18288/0:It won't be easy to get into the VIP lounge -- the elevator is keycoded.  You'll have to be resourceful.
18289/0:The experiments were started by JC Denton and his brother, Paul.  They wanted to develop a biomod architecture that they could distribute to everyone on the planet.
18290/0:The leaders have all fallen.  Now destroy JC Dentons's machine and we are free.  The future is waiting for you, Alex.
18291/0:Each case is slightly different.  Some of you came from the original MJ-12 program and others were selected from the general populace because they were especially compatible with the necessary infusions and genetic manipulations.  
18292/0:
18293/0:Huh.
18294/0:Either way, biomodification's about to become a thing of the past, and that's what matters.
18295/0:I knew the Templars were dangerous, but who knew they were this powerful?
18296/0:Tell Sid it's time for him to get back to work.
18297/0:I guess it could come in handy.  I have some unfinished business in Flight Bay 24.
18298/0:
18299/0:I don't think you're ready to back up that threat.
18299/1:No need to get hostile.
18300/0:How about I bug your chopper and make this learning process go both ways?
18301/0:I don't think you're ready to back up that threat.
18301/1:No need to get hostile.
18302/0:I don't think you're ready to back up that threat.
18302/1:No need to get hostile.
18303/0:I don't think you're ready to back up that threat.
18303/1:No need to get hostile.
18304/0:But people dedicate their lives to these causes, and it turns out they're just your pawns?
18305/0:The Nassif girl was one of the key candidates for nanite infusion at Tarsus.  Her whole family is likely to give itself over to that pollution, so they must be exterminated.
18306/0:I don't think you're permitted in this area.
18306/1:No trespassing.
18307/0:Don't let that thing get loose!
18308/0:The Order is spiritually rich, but that doesn't buy many private jets.  I think Sid Black might be waiting for you at Sak's landing pad.  He would get the job done.
18309/0:I don't think you're permitted in this area.
18309/1:No trespassing.
18310/0:Don't let that thing get loose!
18311/0:I don't think you're permitted in this area.
18311/1:No trespassing.
18312/0:We scared her off.
18312/1:She's getting away!
18313/0:I don't think you're permitted in this area.
18313/1:No trespassing.
18314/0:We scared her off.
18314/1:She's getting away!
18315/0:Really, that's enough.
18315/1:C'mon, I don't need this today.
18316/0:We scared him off.
18316/1:He's getting away!
18317/0:Really, that's enough.
18317/1:C'mon, I don't need this today.
18318/0:We scared him off.
18318/1:He's getting away!
18319/0:Oh Jeez!
18319/1:Whu--u-u-u-h...
18319/2:Whew!
18320/0:It's in my system.  No tellin' WHAT it'll do to me.
18321/0:Oh Jeez!
18321/1:Whu--u-u-u-h...
18321/2:Whew!
18322/0:You're gonna hurt somebody with that thing!  // stern
18322/1:I'm one step ahead of ya...
18323/0:Sounds like a risky operation, but I take it you can afford to hire a few thugs of your own.
18324/0:You're gonna hurt somebody with that thing!  // stern
18324/1:I'm one step ahead of ya...
18325/0:So you see yourself as a god?
18326/0:Nobodies.  I'm surrounded by nobodies.
18327/0:Does yours fit?
18328/0:I don't know how much more I can take.  I just received word that my uncle was murdered.
18329/0:Is something wrong?
18330/0:You mean... all of them?
18331/0:Pure stinkin' bosh!  She took my jet 'cause she said I came up short on a shipment, but she's a lying thief.  Everyone knows Sid's never lost a load.
18332/0:Hey, Chicago.  Great tip.  I let 'em close in and then BAM!  Dropped every last one.
18333/0:Here we go...
18334/0:In any case -- glad to have you back.
18335/0:That's one of the batteries.  It's vulnerable to explosives and EMP attacks, or you could hack the security terminal to disable it.
18336/0:Terrorist!  Go!
18337/0:Chairman Ubair maintains his innocence, but has already retained attorneys for the case.  He will not reveal any specifics about the case nor respond to the accusations, other than to say he has "never failed to honestly serve the citizens of Cairo." 
18338/0:Wait for me.
18339/0:Really, that's enough.
18339/1:C'mon, I don't need this today.
18340/0:Really, that's enough.
18340/1:C'mon, I don't need this today.
18341/0:Enough with this jostling.
18341/1:You're really trying my patience with this.
18342/0:Enough with this jostling.
18342/1:You're really trying my patience with this.
18343/0:That's very generous.  What's the Omar's objective?  Space exploration?  What was that thing at club Vox?
18344/0:Enough with this jostling.
18344/1:You're really trying my patience with this.
18344/2:I am losing patience with your clumsiness!
18344/3:You are being very rude! 
18344/4:The fact that you are a foreigner does not give you the right to molest me!
18345/0:Jeez, man, I'm just doin' my job!
18346/0:Enough with this jostling.
18346/1:You're really trying my patience with this.
18346/2:Did you bump me on purpose?
18346/3:I WILL NOT allow myself to be harrased.  Don't run into me again.
18347/0:Jeez, man, I'm just doin' my job!
18348/0:I'm as good as dead.  Either I go to jail, or I wait around for the Omar to find me.
18349/0:What is your problem?  That hurt.
18349/1:I'm not here for target practice.
18350/0:Jeez, lady, I'm just doin' my job!
18351/0:You tellin' me you busted into Tina's apartment and killed the Champ?
18352/0:What is your problem?  That hurt.
18352/1:I'm not here for target practice.
18353/0:Jeez, lady, I'm just doin' my job!
18354/0:What is your problem?  That hurt.
18354/1:I'm not here for target practice.
18355/0:I think that was meant for me...
18356/0:Such as...?
18357/0:What is your problem?  That hurt.
18357/1:I'm not here for target practice.
18358/0:I think that was meant for me...
18359/0:Some kind of biomod, I guess...  // worried
18359/1:Whoa!  That's not normal.
18360/0:Some kind of biomod, I guess...  // worried
18360/1:Whoa!  That's not normal.
18361/0:This guy's modified!
18362/0:This guy's modified!
18363/0:What are they paying you?
18364/0:
18365/0:The Omar have a way of either absorbing or eliminating the competition.  O'Rourke was dipping from the emperor's well, or maybe I'd have brought him along.  You're either on the team, or you're off the team.  Know what I mean?
18366/0:Once I was like you, mindlessly consuming -- but you've always felt something was missing.  Join the Order and let Her Holiness help you find it.
18367/0:It takes someone with a pretty serious God complex to start their own religion.
18368/0:Oh, I'm sorry, I just assumed you were another disgruntled parent... You ARE a parent of one of the students, aren't you?
18369/0:Welcome to the Order sanctuary for this city, Alex D.  We've been expecting you.
18370/0:Don't shoot!  I give up!
18370/1:I've put down my weapon!
18370/2:I surrender!
18370/3:This ain't worth it -- I quit!
18370/4:I won't cause any trouble, just let me go!
18370/5:Please don't kill me!
18370/6:I'm off-duty now -- permanently!
18371/0:Enough -- I give up!
18371/1:I surrender!
18371/2:I've disarmed!
18371/3:You win!
18371/4:No more -- please!
18371/5:I won't tell anyone.  Just let me live.
18371/6:Don't shoot!
18372/0:Here you go.  [500 credits.]
18373/0:I really don't enjoy this attention.
18373/1:Don't forget to blink.
18374/0:Under control.  The maintenance crew got right on it
18375/0:I really don't enjoy this attention.
18375/1:Don't forget to blink.
18376/0:I really don't enjoy this attention.
18376/1:Don't forget to blink.
18376/2:I wish you would stop staring!
18376/3:Please, stop!
18376/4:I am asking you politely, please stop looking at me!
18377/0:I really don't enjoy this attention.
18377/1:Don't forget to blink.
18377/2:Am I some sort of exotic creature?  Maybe you should take a picture.
18377/3:Stare at somebody else.
18378/0:Maybe you should go rest.  You're acting a bit odd.
18378/1:Is this an act?  Or are you just out of your head?
18379/0:This chick's modified!
18380/0:Match 8!  Back by popular request -- Gob-zilla!  Today's unlucky challenger -- Snake-eyes!  Buy-in is the house minimum.  [100 credits.]  Odds are four-to-one against the Snake.
18381/0:Maybe you should go rest.  You're acting a bit odd.
18381/1:Is this an act?  Or are you just out of your head?
18382/0:This chick's modified!
18383/0:Maybe you should go rest.  You're acting a bit odd.
18383/1:Is this an act?  Or are you just out of your head?
18383/2:I think I am going to have to report you.
18383/3:Do you want me to call the authorities?
18383/4:Are you trying to get yourself in trouble?
18384/0:Some sort of cloaking device...
18385/0:Heck yeah.  I've got the keys and codes for every door in this place.  They all dismiss me as Lower Seattle trash, but I see more than they would like.  Someday it's going to pay off.
18386/0:Maybe you should go rest.  You're acting a bit odd.
18386/1:Is this an act?  Or are you just out of your head?
18386/2:You are going to be in big trouble.
18386/3:Unbelievable!  That will have to stop!
18387/0:Some sort of cloaking device...
18388/0:You're not intimidating me, just aggravating me.
18388/1:I think you should reconsider that course of action.
18389/0:Watch out.  The sneak's invisible.
18390/0:You're not intimidating me, just aggravating me.
18390/1:I think you should reconsider that course of action.
18391/0:Watch out.  The sneak's invisible.
18392/0:Oh my God!  It blew up in mid-air!
18393/0:Be patient.  We can't just rush in there.
18394/0:Oh my God!  It blew up in mid-air!
18395/0:Alex!  You were right, Her Holiness and Mr. Dumier had a secret alliance all along.
18396/0:Oh my God -- a skull gun!
18397/0:Oh my God -- a skull gun!
18398/0:I took care of your enemies.  The leaders of both the Order and the Templars are dead.
18399/0:You're a fool.  All JC's machine requires is your brain's neural tissue.  If you are unwilling, I will have to bring your head to him myself.
18400/0:Purity is the only way to save humanity from ruin.  I had hoped you'd eventually see this.
18401/0:There was concern that you might be lured away from the Illuminati.
18402/0:The Order Church deceives itself.  There is nothing but cruelty in this world.
18403/0:Talk to Metro Man over there.
18404/0:Tell me about this epidemic.
18405/0:You're not intimidating me, just aggravating me.
18405/1:I think you should reconsider that course of action.
18406/0:You're not intimidating me, just aggravating me.
18406/1:I think you should reconsider that course of action.
18407/0:I thought I was clear.  This is a restricted area.
18407/1:Move along already.
18408/0:I thought I was clear.  This is a restricted area.
18408/1:Move along already.
18409/0:I can't even afford the EMP grenades. [400]
18410/0:
18411/0:I thought I was clear.  This is a restricted area.
18411/1:Move along already.
18412/0:I thought I was clear.  This is a restricted area.
18412/1:Move along already.
18413/0:She wants into Tarsus, huh?  I'll see what I can do.
18414/0:I've just about hit my limit.
18414/1:I only have so much patience.
18415/0:I've just about hit my limit.
18415/1:I only have so much patience.
18416/0:The arcology was supposed to be safe.  That is the whole point of the WTO.
18417/0:I've just about hit my limit.
18417/1:I only have so much patience.
18418/0:Well done.  Now you'll have to unlock that door.  Shouldn't take more than one multitool, or you could always just blow it up, if you aren't afraid of attracting guards.
18419/0:I've just about hit my limit.
18419/1:I only have so much patience.
18420/0:Don't think you can get anything past me.  I'm still SSC, and I'm on duty.
18421/0:Purity is the only way to save humanity from ruin.  I had hoped you'd eventually see this.
18422/0:I wish I'd been born in the Middle Ages.  It was possible to be a hero then, someone with a name, a quest, a coat of arms... 
18423/0:What's the latest gossip?
18424/0:We'll show them exactly what our "pollution" can do in the field.
18425/0:And you are a Tarsus man?  Yes?  Well, perhaps you can have a word with the headmaster.  I will give you my parental code: 74652.  Tarsus is on Level 107.  Tell the fat bum I want him to return my calls.  Where is my girl?  Why couldn't Leila find her last night?
18426/0:SSC records show that several students have been reported missing.  You might want to ask some of the children if they know what's going on.
18427/0:Their intention to disguise tyranny with so-called "free" institutions.
18428/0:Are their legs frozen or something?
18429/0:You are about to cross the line. 
18429/1:This is it.  Don't push me any further.
18430/0:You are about to cross the line. 
18430/1:This is it.  Don't push me any further.
18431/0:Destroy a whole city -- for one laboratory?
18432/0:You are about to cross the line. 
18432/1:This is it.  Don't push me any further.
18433/0:(clears throat)  There.  All done!  My compliments.
18434/0:You are about to cross the line. 
18434/1:This is it.  Don't push me any further.
18435/0:Lucky for you, I've got a lot of patience.
18435/1:Glad you came to your senses before I had to teach you a lesson.
18436/0:Lucky for you, I've got a lot of patience.
18436/1:Glad you came to your senses before I had to teach you a lesson.
18437/0:Lucky for you, I've got a lot of patience.
18437/1:Glad you came to your senses before I had to teach you a lesson.
18438/0:Lucky for you, I've got a lot of patience.
18438/1:Glad you came to your senses before I had to teach you a lesson.
18439/0:Just stick together.  We can handle this.
18440/0:We'll show YOU...
18441/0:Don't forget to come see me at the Order church, Alex.  That landing pad is run by a local smuggler, Sophia Sak.  Looks like they've seized Sid Black's harrier -- probably as payment for phony debts.  It never hurts to have a pilot who owes you a favor.  You could pay the debt or -- better -- eliminate Sak and her henchmen for the good of the whole neighborhood.
18442/0:Climate control damaged.  Situation critical. 
18443/0:I bet they aren't even working on a cure.  And who could blame them -- none of their families ever get sick.
18444/0:
18445/0:I have been sick for years now.
18446/0:SSC, at your service.
18447/0:I keep track of everyone who goes in and out of this hangar.
18448/0:
18449/0:I can't pay that much for the ammo clip. [200]
18450/0:Because you're an extraordinary creation, Alex.  We've been watching your progress for a long time, waiting for this moment.
18451/0:They're gonna shut the Inclinator down completely.  I've been sayin' that since it was built.
18452/0:
18453/0:Welcome back.  I just revived your brother JC in Antarctica.  Tracer Tong is coordinating with him from Germany.
18454/0:Let's talk about you.
18455/0:You're really JC Denton.  What happened to your brother?
18456/0:How do you mean?
18457/0:We can defend ourselves!
18458/0:Rise with us, Denton.
18459/0:We won't stand for this!
18460/0:Go back to preaching your nonsense.  I have no time for this.
18461/0:I'm on my way for help.
18462/0:I'm on my way for help.
18463/0:I never expected something like this to happen.  A raid?  I thought we were prepared for every eventuality.
18464/0:I'm on my way for help.
18465/0:Between SSC watches and the security systems, Tarsus is as safe as it can be.
18466/0:
18466/1:
18466/2:
18466/3:
18467/0:I'm on my way for help.
18468/0:You are becoming a very interesting source of information.  I will help you to recover the component for the teleportation device.
18469/0:That's enough.  I'm leaving.
18470/0:That's enough.  I'm leaving.
18471/0:The leaders.  The ones dragging the rest of the planet into this mess.  And JC Denton's utopia machine, whatever it is.  I'm ready to back you up -- just give me an assignment.
18472/0:That's enough.  I'm leaving.
18472/1:Stay away from me!  Stay away!
18472/2:I haven't hurt anyone!
18473/0:Let's just say that if this investigation of ApostleCorp does indeed uncover technologies for the modification and commodification of human bodies, I don't entirely trust the current leadership to destroy them.
18474/0:That's enough.  I'm leaving.
18474/1:Oh no!  What do I do?
18474/2:I need to find someplace to hide...
18475/0:Which side?  Order or WTO?
18476/0:Hallway patrol is normal Tarsus procedure.
18477/0:Exchange aborted.
18478/0:I'm ready to make a run for it.  The infested air in the medina would be better than waiting for our doom here.
18479/0:Guess the Inclinator's open for business.  That didn't take very long...
18480/0:Whenever I talk about it, my toe starts to hurt.  Thanks a lot.
18481/0:Hm.  It's been disabled.
18482/0:Someone must've turned it on.
18483/0:Someone must've turned it off.
18484/0:Sounds like we will be able to relax now.
18485/0:Someone turned on the light.
18486/0:Someone turned off the light.
18487/0:
18488/0:That wasn't open before...
18489/0:That wasn't closed before...
18490/0:Unconscious.... Hm.
18491/0:Hm, dead.  I don't like it.
18492/0:(sigh)  Someone sure did a number on him.
18493/0:It's an even match.  They can't get in, but we can't get out.
18494/0:Her Holiness comes to Trier to make peace, and her gesture is answered with rioting.
18495/0:I gotta at least break even if I'm gonna burn fuel.  That rate includes covert placement, curb drops, hostile pickups.  Other flyers charge less but don't deliver -- a bunch of sods, in my opinion.
18496/0:Let's go.
18497/0:That's why you refuse to support companies like QueeQueg's Coffee, which cut costs by exploiting poor bean growers.
18498/0:Hmm...
18498/1:Uh... what?
18499/0:That's bizarre.
18499/1:How odd.
18500/0:Airborne particulates detected.  Filtering...
18500/1:Neutralizing chemical hazard.
18500/2:Air quality unacceptable... correcting.
18501/0:They can tell that I already had one of the biomod treatments -- They will kill me!  I know it!
18502/0:Air quality returned to normal.
18502/1:Particulate count reduced.
18502/2:Verifying atmospheric composition... hazard eliminated.
18503/0:Biotox emergency.  Responding...
18503/1:Human exposed to toxin.  Assisting...
18503/2:Neutralizing subcutaneous poison concentrations.
18504/0:Decontamination complete.  Biotox readings normal.
18504/1:Poison neutralized.
18504/2:Physiology restored.
18505/0:I'm glad I could help.
18506/0:Fire detected.  Responding.
18506/1:Attempting to extinguish flames.
18507/0:Fire suppressed.
18507/1:Object no longer burning.
18508/0:
18509/0:Think you can find your way out?
18510/0:Get outta there!
18511/0:Alpha-particle levels unsafe... Responding.
18511/1:Absorbing radioactive material...
18512/0:I hope the headmaster doesn't find out about this place.
18513/0:Radiation levels back to normal.
18513/1:Area treated for radioactive material.
18514/0:Just a minute -- can't carry anything else right now.
18515/0:Busted out?  You guys standing point for some sort of jailbreak?
18516/0:(sigh)  Someone sure did a number on her.
18517/0:Finish him off, Alex!  None of us will be safe until he's dead.
18518/0:Who's throwing things around...?  // annoyed
18519/0:It seems to be gone.
18520/0:Well, she's out cold.  Happy now?
18521/0:According to my map, there should be an airport 22 kilometers northeast of central Cairo.  Instead, that seems to be the site of a landfill.
18522/0:That wasn't there...
18523/0:Hm...
18523/1:Strange...
18524/0:
18525/0:Well!  Maybe it IS something...
18525/1:This better not keep up.
18526/0:Huh.  Now what?
18526/1:It must be back...
18527/0:If you have official business, speak with Chief Morgan.
18528/0:Must be nothing.
18528/1:Could've been anything.
18529/0:Damn, slipped away...
18529/1:Lucky beggar...
18530/0:If it was me, I'd go around.  Crawl through an air vent or something.
18531/0:Damn, he got away.
18532/0:You're pretty sharp.  I should warn you that the manager of Club Vox hired me to kill you.
18533/0:Attention.  Biohazard detected.  Please leave the area.
18533/1:Danger -- chemical hazard.  Neutralization not complete.
18534/0:Attention.  Flames detected.  Please leave the area.
18534/1:Danger -- fire.
18535/0:Danger.  Radiation.  Please leave the area.
18535/1:Attention.  Radiation levels exceed health standards.
18536/0:Job aborted.
18537/0:Access denied.
18538/0:Internal damage.  Need repairs.
18539/0:Systems (garble garble) error (garble) signal loss (garble)...
18540/0:Well, I'm glad you pulled through.  That's some bad luck, though.  You won't have the chance to eavesdrop on the recruiting kiosk after something like that, which is what we need -- the specifics about the raid.
18541/0:Autonomous processing interrupted.
18542/0:Autonomous processing restored.
18543/0:(electric squeal) Evading attack!
18543/1:Danger!  (squeal)  Danger!
18543/2:Encountered interference.  Unable to proceed with task.
18544/0:I'm pretty good... definitely a better artist than I ever was a secretary.
18545/0:Thanks a million.  No tellin' what he was gonna do next.
18546/0:You've sure got a prime location for your business here.
18547/0:A writer either has the eye or he doesn't.  He has to see past these comfortable smiles and dry-cleaned neck-sweaters.
18548/0:Damn, she got away.
18549/0:Well.  The next assault won't be so easy...
18550/0:The Order believes in natural balance and they see Tarsus's operations as a violation of that.  It's impossible to live a balanced life if your actions are secretly manipulated by a lab with its own agenda.  Now you have the chance to see the real Tarsus -- Explore the facility, starting with your apartment.
18551/0:The killer's gone.  A shame.  A real shame.
18552/0:Damn, looks like the thief disappeared.
18553/0:Better take a look.
18553/1:Only one way to get to the bottom of this...
18553/2:Somebody up to something?
18554/0:Come out in the open.  That's an order.
18554/1:Fool.  Do you have any idea who I am?
18554/2:I always get my mouse.
18555/0:My guess is that it was a botched infusion.  Justice, if you ask me.  Mother Nature's way of saying, "Don't play with that."
18556/0:What's going on?  I have a right to know if I'm in danger.
18557/0:Now I've got you!
18557/1:I know just how to handle this...
18558/0:Slick guy like you?  You could come up with the cash if you really wanted to.
18559/0:Hey, you!
18560/0:You won't get away!
18560/1:NOW you did it.
18560/2:I'm right on your tail...
18561/0:Aaaa!
18561/1:Holy--
18562/0:Just get me close to downtown.  I'm looking for someone.
18563/0:Let's talk about you.
18564/0:Operations failing.  (squeal)
18565/0:Requesting assistance.
18566/0:Task scheduled.  Proceeding.
18567/0:Analyzing atmosphere...
18567/1:Routine detection continuing.
18567/2:Air quality normal.
18567/3:Health hazards minimal.
18568/0:Air quality unacceptable.
18568/1:Caution -- prolonged inhalation of contaminants could result in brachial deposits.
18568/2:Self-replicating pollutants... attempting to control.
18568/3:Warning -- carbanocarbon dust.
18569/0:Releasing self-replicating counteragent.
18569/1:Counteragent effective.  Air quality improving.
18569/2:Attention -- estimated cleanup time, twenty-four hours.
18570/0:We've got to regroup and figure out how we're going to deal with this new menace.
18571/0:Air quality poor.  Remain indoors or use respiration equipment.
18571/1:Particulate density increasing.
18571/2:Filtration ineffective.  Recalibrating.
18571/3:Warning: carbanocarbon deposits can cause asthma, internal bleeding, in some cases death.
18572/0:A pretty cryptic comment.
18573/0:Air quality normal.
18573/1:Health hazards minimal.
18573/2:Self-replicating counteragent present -- region secure.
18573/3:Airborne particle concentration is negligible.
18574/0:Here's the code to the lab.  Just check back in with me when the job's done and I'll give you your pay.  [100]
18575/0:(vaccuum sound)
18575/1:(analysis bleeps)
18575/2:(grinding)  // internal destruction of impure particles
18576/0:Guess that would pay better than these medina scabs.  I offer to save their lives, and the best they can do is 12 credits.  How about you make a reasonable offer, and we get out of this hole.
18577/0:I'm the reason Gob-zilla's dead.  I think you owe me.
18578/0:
18579/0:I see you found what I brought you from Cairo -- the biomod canister on the crate over there.  It was a payment from the Omar.  Personally, I'm done with biomodification.
18580/0:Gotcha!  I'm a little quicker than the regulars...
18580/1:Now what're you gonna do?
18580/2:I think you're caught.
18581/0:Sounds like a cult.
18582/0:Time to drop this beggar...
18583/0:Thought you could get away, huh?
18583/1:Coward.
18583/2:Enough games.
18583/3:This is starting to get old.
18584/0:Better draw your weapon.
18585/0:Yeah, it seemed like the paperwork was kinda odd on that one they shuffled back to the Flight Bay 24 storage room so quickly.
18586/0:Easy shot...
18586/1:There.
18586/2:I'm a pretty steady shot.  // warning
18587/0:I need armor!  Go!  Go!  Go!
18588/0:His Time will come again...
18589/0:
18590/0:Better call in a bot.
18591/0:So?
18592/0:I dropped my weapon!
18592/1:Enough -- I give up!
18592/2:I surrender!
18592/3:They don't pay enough for me to keep fighting!
18592/4:It's just a job -- I quit!
18592/5:I can't take anymore!
18592/6:Don't shoot!  I've disarmed!
18592/7:An SSC kill is no trophy.  Really.
18593/0:I dropped my weapon!
18593/1:Enough -- I give up!
18593/2:I surrender!
18593/3:They don't pay enough for me to keep fighting!
18593/4:It's just a job -- I quit!
18593/5:I can't take anymore!
18593/6:Don't shoot!  I've disarmed!
18593/7:An SSC kill is no trophy.  Really.
18594/0:No time for chit-chat.
18595/0:SSC authorities are not sure whether he has been abducted or whether he is responsible in some way for the deaths.  The investigation continues...
18596/0:(squeal)  Watch your head.  Injuries may occur.
18596/1:Collision.  (squeal)  Evading contact.
18596/2:Be advised: nanoformer bots in operation.
18597/0:Chassis damaged.
18597/1:Primary circuits disrupted.
18597/2:Threat to operations.
18597/3:Incident recorded.  Vandal on file.
18598/0:Attention: airborne nanoformers.
18598/1:Alert.  Nanoformer bot present.
18599/0:Greetings.
18600/0:I want to live and work honestly, as Her Holiness teaches we should.
18601/0:Initiating repairs.
18601/1:Repairing damage.
18602/0:Functionality restored.
18602/1:Repairs complete.
18602/2:Finished.
18603/0:Charging complete.
18603/1:Energy at maximum.
18604/0:Proximity device detected.
18604/1:Removing explosive device.
18605/0:He offered to meet with Order high-priestess Her Holiness for talks designed to ease misunderstanding between the two groups.
18606/0:He's pinned down in the Inclinator right now, negotiating with the authorities for safe passage out of Seattle.  I want you to infiltrate the facility and learn what you can about this betrayal.  Then perhaps we will be closer to understanding his actions at Tarsus Academy.
18607/0:Explosive device neutralized.
18607/1:Deactivated proximity device.
18608/0:Sure, take out Dumier's commandos on the dock.  [1000]
18609/0:So you want me to disarm in the middle of a warzone?
18610/0:I don't know what to say....  Thanks, Alex.  I'll pay you back -- double.
18611/0:I have on my desk here in Geneva a petition... a petition from the citizens of Upper Seattle for more real estate, a bigger enclave, a larger population...  I assure you that my staff is carefully considering the next step for your community.  You are correct that Symmetriad's nanoformer processes make high-rise construction trivial, but there are other concerns, such as stabilizing the value of the property you already own.
18612/0:The Templars caught us off guard.  Most everyone is either dead or captured.
18613/0:That would be a big mistake.  You'll be marked if you start doing jobs for the Harvester.  But there's no point debating about it.  Tell you what.  Let me live and I'll give you the keypad code to the nanoformer bot bay.
18614/0:I wish I had enough credits for the multitools. [400]
18615/0:Perfect job for a drone...
18616/0:Too late for runnin' away...
18616/1:Hit and run, huh?
18616/2:Don't worry -- I'll flush you out...
18617/0:At least you know when you're beat.
18617/1:You're not getting off that easy...
18617/2:They always want to run for it.
18618/0:What's the matter?  I'm standing right here.
18618/1:You're gonna have to do better than that.
18618/2:Close...
18619/0:The Inclinator's shut down and this area's closed off, due to a toxic spill.
18620/0:Must be some sort of biomod.
18620/1:This isn't the first time I've fought someone who's modified.
18621/0:They'll have to replace the entire inventory.
18622/0:(grunt)
18622/1:(grunt)
18623/0:I hope this is not some weird test of my concentration...
18624/0:Seriously, I'm on duty.
18625/0:I'm under strict orders not to discuss our work.
18626/0:(groan)
18626/1:(groan)
18627/0:(moan)
18627/1:(moan) No...
18628/0:(gasp) (cough)
18629/0:(scream)
18630/0:You're pleading for your life, and that's the best you can do -- a keypad code?
18631/0:If anything happens to Her Holiness, I don't want to imagine what will become of the Order Church.
18632/0:Stay sharp, Chicago.
18633/0:That elevator was damaged during the attack.  You'll have to use the one in the laboratory on the upper level.
18634/0:A threat from the arcology, but the Omar endure.
18635/0:This way and that.  Thought I could catch some business when the summit breaks up.  Seen the sights yet?  Don't mind doing local hops in between starkbier.
18636/0:You mean kill everybody on the island?
18637/0:Cheerio!  I'm booked until after the summit, but maybe we'll fly again.  I'll be around.
18638/0:How'd Gob-zilla get killed?
18639/0:They've set up camp not far from here and prevent us from leaving.  We suspect they are trying to gain entrance to JC's habitat.
18640/0:So you think they're safe?
18641/0:I bet I know who engineered the spill, just from the look he gave me.
18642/0:A writer either has the eye or he doesn't.  He has to see past these comfortable smiles and dry-cleaned neck-sweaters.
18643/0:(groan) I can't see!
18644/0:Was that supposed to hurt?
18645/0:We have heard Luminon Saman's call for a return to scripture.  In this shard we read the scripture, the original word of Her Holiness, not what she says for the camera today or tomorrow or two weeks ago.
18646/0:(groan)
18647/0:Don't wait.  Take care of the job.
18648/0:(groan) Damn you!
18649/0:For a pretty lady like you, the going rate minus twenty percent.  [400 credits.]  But I'm up the swanny until I get those mercs away from my jet.  Maybe you could arrange an accident, know what I mean?  Take out Sak and her two-bit security force.  You look like the type, wiry, steely-eyed -- like this lady bounty hunter I dated once.
18650/0:(grunt)
18651/0:(sigh)
18652/0:
18653/0:That's right -- it's for real.
18653/1:Guess you felt that one.
18653/2:What did you expect, huh?
18654/0:Good clean shot.
18654/1:My aim just gets better.
18655/0:Always watching us, hurting us.  Free us from this cage.
18656/0:Glad that's taken care of.
18656/1:I think that does it.
18656/2:I'm happy we could find a diplomatic solution.
18656/3:Textbook takedown.  Hm, could make good instructional material, if one of the cameras caught it.
18657/0:Damn...
18657/1:Losing my touch.
18657/2:Missed my chance...
18658/0:The Omar appreciate good customers.
18659/0:The violence... never ends....
18660/0:The bookie's got your money.
18661/0:I wanna see some guts.  Come on!
18662/0:Trier's just been a circus lately.
18663/0:You just have to live one day at a time.
18664/0:Well, at the Strand Institute --
18665/0:You better get out while you can.
18666/0:
18666/1:
18666/2:
18666/3:
18667/0:(gasp)
18668/0:(gasp)
18669/0:Wait here.
18670/0:(gasp)
18671/0:I got a hit.
18671/1:Not that hard to connect, really.
18671/2:That's Templar training!
18671/3:Huh -- you flinched.
18672/0:Come on.  Take a shot.
18672/1:Now we play by MY rules.
18672/2:They gave me command for a reason, you know.
18673/0:I got a hit.
18673/1:Not that hard to connect, really.
18673/2:Tch.  Shoots a little left.
18673/3:Bang on target.
18673/4:Beautiful shot.
18674/0:Back in your hole, beggar.
18675/0:I got a hit.
18675/1:Not that hard to connect, really.
18676/0:Excellent work as usual, Lt. Archer.  You will be pleased to hear, in turn, that we have seized the ApostleCorp facility.  It was right under our noses, on Level 108.  Transmitting the suite's softkey ID so that you can join us at your leisure.
18677/0:This is the part where you try to make a break for it.
18677/1:What't the matter?  Not turning out like you planned?
18677/2:Funny way to die.  I guess you've got your reasons.
18678/0:I got him.
18679/0:(grunt)
18679/1:(grunt)
18680/0:I got him.
18681/0:Incoming!
18682/0:I got him.
18683/0:Fire in the hole.
18684/0:I got her.
18685/0:Thanks again.  Good luck.
18686/0:Someone set a trap.
18686/1:Looks like a proximity device.
18687/0:I'm blocked!
18688/0:It won't budge.
18689/0:Taken care of.  Let's just say I'm a fan of Pequod's coffee.
18690/0:(grunt)
18691/0:
18692/0:There's a dead body in the storeroom.
18693/0:I didn't go to the WTO.  The only person I told about the Omar in the VIP area was NG Resonance.  Her simulation, the hologram in the club.
18694/0:By the way, we let Miss Sparks go.  Chief Morgan took her out of the arcology.  I'm glad that we can trust each other, Alex.
18695/0:I got her.
18696/0:I got her.
18697/0:Just one more hit like that...
18697/1:(laughs)  Easy target.
18698/0:Just one more hit like that...
18698/1:(laughs)  Easy target.
18699/0:Too dangerous.
18700/0:Just one more hit like that...
18700/1:(laughs)  Easy target.
18701/0:More bellyachin'... (groan)
18701/1:Always stickin' me on the line...
18701/2:Guess rank has its privileges.
18701/3:I TOLD 'em...
18702/0:Another Templar victory.
18702/1:The quest for Purity prevails.
18702/2:Thank Baphomet.
18702/3:Put my training to good use.
18702/4:Sad, sad, sad.
18702/5:I've done my duty.
18702/6:Someday the killing will end.
18702/7:Another one falls to the cause.
18702/8:One for the righteous.
18702/9:All in a day's work.
18703/0:(yawn)
18703/1:(grrr)
18703/2:(cough)
18703/3:(clears throat)
18703/4:(whistles)  // WTO theme, if/when available
18704/0:Another victory.
18704/1:The quest for Purity prevails.
18704/2:You can't escape your fate.
18704/3:Another step closer...
18704/4:And down goes another fool.
18704/5:One less enemy to Purity...
18704/6:Not so tough now, are ya?
18704/7:Down ya go.
18704/8:I'm pretty good at this stuff...
18705/0:It must be a sign of the end times!
18706/0:Shhh.  Hold that thought.
18706/1:Wait -- I think someone's coming.
18707/0:Another Templar victory.
18707/1:The quest for Purity prevails.
18707/2:Should never have taken on a Templar.
18707/3:The grand master will be pleased.
18707/4:Our opponents are beginning to fall...
18707/5:One less pest.
18708/0:It's one thing to mislead the customer -- but shop-owners, too?
18709/0:Looks like things are getting back to normal.
18710/0:Real cute.
18710/1:Hey.  What's the idea?
18711/0:And now, you meet your end, freak.
18711/1:One less impurity to worry about....
18711/2:Clearly, inferior to true humans.
18712/0:Keep clear.
18712/1:You ran into me.  // annoyed
18713/0:Yeah?  What's that scumbag up to?  Give me something I can get a warrant with, and it means a Citizen's Bonus to you.
18714/0:And now, you meet your end, freak.
18714/1:One less impurity to worry about....
18714/2:Clearly, inferior to true humans.
18715/0:Lookin' at something?
18715/1:I feel like I'm being cased.
18716/0:Excuse me.  Ahem.  None of that.
18716/1:Hey -- that's not allowed.
18716/2:You know better than that.
18717/0:Area restricted.  Please leave.
18717/1:Sorry.  No access.
18718/0:Thanks.
18719/0:Put that away.
18719/1:You tryin' to mug me or what?
18720/0:...so this one's a Denton too, but not crazy like the others?
18721/0:That's why you refuse to support companies like QueeQueg's Coffee, which cut costs by exploiting poor bean growers.
18722/0:...it's like a cat playing with it's prey.  Why don't they finish off those SSC holed up in the hangar already?
18723/0:It's now used for classified research.  Apparently the Templars are funding one of the projects.
18724/0:I haven't got the credits for the biomods. [850]
18725/0:Say that again...?
18726/0:Dr. Manus, we recognize that someone of your stature at Mako Ballistics is involved in several top ranking development projects.  We also know that we've given you millions of credits for this exclusive contract, so we feel are within rights to demand that you meet your deadlines and provide another demonstration as soon as possible.
18727/0:My little analyzer has already transmitted the sequence back to my desk.
18728/0:
18729/0:Just get me close to downtown.  I'm looking for someone.
18730/0:Sure, take out Dumier's commandos on the dock.  [2000]
18731/0:The Aquinas hub -- It is the heart of the old structures...
18732/0:That's great. If you can take care of this, I'll pay well.  If you manage to take care of it, report back to me, so I know it's safe to reactivate operations.  Until then, no one's going to be able to get down to Lower Seattle. 
18733/0:Unbelievable.... They've deceived millions, hundreds of millions of people!  We can't let them get away with this!  Thank you.  You've saved me the hassle of hiring any more lawyers.  I hope you'll accept a small reward.
18734/0:And now, you meet your end, freak.
18734/1:One less impurity to worry about....
18734/2:Clearly, inferior to true humans.
18735/0:I missed the little fiend.
18735/1: I can't connect!  
18736/0:I missed the little fiend.
18736/1:I can't connect!  
18737/0:JC Denton worked with the Illuminati?
18738/0:I missed the little fiend.
18738/1: I can't connect!  
18739/0:Hey!  Watch it!
18739/1:You better not do that again.
18740/0:Bah!  I missed!
18740/1: I can't connect!  
18741/0:The judgment of our leaders is never impaired.  Next rev of Dentons lacks apparent flaws of its predecessors.
18742/0:You better listen to me.
18742/1:Hey, that's enough.
18742/2:Smart alec.
18743/0:Bah!  I missed!
18743/1:I can't connect!  
18744/0:Don't give me that look.  Move.
18744/1:Go stare at someone else.
18745/0:Bah!  I missed!
18745/1: I can't connect!  
18746/0:You're clumsy or you're pickin' a fight.
18746/1:That hurt!
18747/0:(grunt)
18747/1:(grunt)
18748/0:Stop playing games.
18748/1:You're not kidding around, are you?
18748/2:Put down the weapon right now.
18749/0:(grunt)
18749/1:(grunt)
18750/0:The JC-Helios AI will be the new government, responsive to every need, large and small.
18751/0:I'll do it!  They think they can trick me into serving their illegal scheme.  The answer is no, my friend.  The answer is no.
18752/0:Go.  I mean it.
18752/1:Off-limits.  Don't make me use force.
18753/0:(grunt)
18753/1:(grunt)
18754/0:
18755/0:Just keep it up.
18755/1:I've about had it.
18755/2:You deaf or something?
18756/0:I need a matter clip.  I'll take it.  [400]
18757/0:Alex D.  A welcome encounter.
18758/0:Go ahead.  It's your life.
18758/1:Stop!  This minute!
18758/2:Don't say you weren't warned.
18759/0:You had me worried back there.
18759/1:Just settle down.  We've got work to do.
18760/0:Not now.
18760/1:Can't talk...
18761/0:He sent me a childish drawing of a dolphin, and now he thinks he owns dolphins.  The fact is that I had ten dolphin proposals for the Galleria sculpture alone, and his was the worst.
18762/0:All right.  I'm ready.
18763/0:Any more pointers?
18764/0:So I already got a lead on this epidemic in Old Cairo.  Courtesy of the Omar in the medina, I've got some information about a possible cure.
18765/0:Lockdown lifted.  Normal operations resuming.
18766/0:Only the select qualify for admission into Cairo's Tarsus Academy.  Is your son or daughter our next star?
18767/0:The Chicago disaster is occupying every available craft.  You shouldn't have any trouble finding a pilot at the Greasel Pit Bar in Lower Seattle.  I don't care who flies you in, just get there.  Mako is developing a new firearm called the Mag Rail.  In addition to finding Nassif, the WTO needs an agent who can get us the Mag Rail schematic.  I hope that will be you, Alex.
18768/0:Hey, this is ME you're talking to.  "Scientific research should be based on an altruistic gift economy, not profit."  That's straight out of your master's thesis, Karl.
18769/0:Reportedly, she will cautiously accept the summit invitation but will emphasize her belief that WTO policies are the root cause of the rioting, not Order evangelism.
18770/0:Coward!  Come out where I can see you!
18770/1:I've lost the target.
18770/2:I love it when they run.
18770/3:Coward!  There'll be no mercy when we find you.
18770/4:Don't be foolish... you can't hide from the Templars!
18771/0:Coward!  Come out where I can see you!
18771/1:I've lost the target.
18771/2:Go ahead... hide.  Coward.
18771/3:Too quiet.  I don't like it.
18771/4:(mutters) Hide and seek again!
18771/5:What's the matter... had enough?
18771/6:Don't even dream of hiding from me.
18772/0:Besides the usual offerings, we've got the latest NG sim on the second floor.  The owner usually hangs out up there, where he can watch everything.  If you need more privacy than the ground floor can offer, you might ask him about the VIP Club.  The stairs are on the right, just after you enter.
18773/0:Coward!  Come out where I can see you!
18773/1:I've lost the target.
18774/0:Where did that little freak sneak off to?
18774/1:I've lost that filthy abomination!  Gah!
18775/0:Uh-oh.
18775/1:Sorry -- my fault.
18776/0:Where did that little freak sneak off to?
18776/1:I've lost that filthy abomination!  Gah!
18777/0:Hi.
18777/1:Hello.
18778/0:Where did that little freak sneak off to?
18778/1:I've lost that filthy abomination!  Gah!
18779/0:At ease.
18779/1:Officer.
18780/0:He's trying to be sneaky now.  Idiot.
18781/0:Yeah, she's really hot, but she's fun to talk to, too.
18782/0:Hi.
18782/1:Hello.
18783/0:He's trying to be sneaky now.  Idiot.
18784/0:Officer.
18784/1:At ease, officer.
18785/0:He's trying to be sneaky now.  Idiot.
18786/0:Over there.
18787/0:She's trying to be sneaky now.  Idiot.
18788/0:Sorry -- no idea.
18789/0:
18790/0:What the --
18790/1:Good God!
18791/0:Hm.  Some kind of movement...
18791/1:I saw SOMETHING...
18792/0:Very well.  Forget the briefing.  We've had our suspicions about the Templar activity around the Black Gate.  If it's true that they're the ones holding Her Holiness, I want you to find her and make sure she is safe.
18793/0:I see you!  // threatening
18794/0:That sounds like it's from Mark Finley, Seattle's Minister of Culture.  Now why would he be talking to Nassif about hiding a shipment?   Is Tarsus involved in some sort of smuggling operation?  Come to the holocom so we can talk.
18795/0:What are you selling?
18796/0:Level 1.
18797/0:I've known Mike for years....
18798/0:Level 2.
18799/0:Level 3.
18800/0:Level 4.
18801/0:Level 5.
18802/0:That's one of the subjects.
18803/0:We are waiting.
18804/0:More hours.
18805/0:Due to recent events, all bots and security personnel have been mobilized.  
18806/0:Please do not report any of these transactions.
18807/0:
18808/0:I just kept one of your fellow Seekers from getting killed by a couple of thugs.
18809/0:Ready yet?  Let's get out of here.
18810/0:She's trying to be sneaky now.  Idiot.
18811/0:
18812/0:She's trying to be sneaky now.  Idiot.
18813/0:I told you -- those weapon mods are stolen.  They don't belong in a display case on the side of the road.
18814/0:The nanomanipulators in the Minister of Culture's penthouse were intended for scientists in this lab.  Search the lab director's office for evidence about Dr. Nassif's whereabouts.
18815/0:These machines were built before you were born.  Would you like some help figuring them out?
18816/0:Living in the comfort of a WTO arcology, it's easy to take for granted all the theory and work that went into constructing these living spaces.
18817/0:Now for the big time....
18818/0:Pequod's is on the cutting edge of nutrition and biomedicine.  Our coffee will whiten your teeth and protect against ulcers.
18819/0:I've already done my own investigating there.  
18820/0:I was one of the Church's first disciples!
18821/0:Loosen up, Karl.  We're doing SCIENCE here.  Remember when you'd get drunk and start quoting Freeman Dyson?  I know you're on my side.  Pre-Collapse science was all about toys for the rich over necessities for the poor.  Haven't we gotten past that?
18822/0:That bot is pretty scary.  I have never seen one shoot at people before...
18823/0:Please leave me alone -- I am in class right now.
18824/0:No thanks necessary.  Compensation for whistle-blowers is one of the pillars of a safe community.
18825/0:Enough of this garbage.  We know what you did and now you are going to regret it.
18826/0:Where's your mask?  Want to get sick?
18827/0:
18827/1:
18827/2:
18827/3:
18828/0:Clever girl... What's the matter?  Don't like talking politics?
18829/0:The commodification of ability -- tuition, of course, but, increasingly, genetic treatments, cybernetic protocols, now biomods -- has had the side effect of creating a self-perpetuating aristocracy in all advanced societies.  When ability becomes a public resource, what will distinguish people will be what they do with it.  Intention.  Dedication.  Integrity.  The qualities we would choose as the bedrock of the social order.
18830/0:I haven't seen this craft before. Welcome to our small medina.
18831/0:Thanks.
18832/0:
18832/1:
18832/2:
18832/3:
18832/4:
18833/0:
18834/0:Is that you out there, Alex?  I saw one of the leaders go down.  They're made of flesh just like you and me.  Forget their schemes.  Wipe them all out and destroy whatever it is JC Denton built inside the Statue.  I'm serious.  Meet me at the comm van if you want some help.
18835/0:My seekers, from today you are all missionaries.  Chairman Dumier welcomes your teaching in the WTO enclaves.  Just as Rome, once touched, fell to the spell of Christianity, so too will the city-states of our time accept order, respect, and balance.
18836/0:Just do your best, and I'm sure you'll get a good rating.  We have drills in the morning, exercise and self-study in the afternoons.  Oh!  And you'll be getting a suite of biomods -- they give you the infusions during the first week.
18837/0:The biomod's too pricey for me. [1000]
18838/0:May Her Holiness watch over you.
18839/0:Give me the key to the penthouse's backdoor. [300]
18840/0:You followers haven't expelled you yet?
18841/0:And what did you find?
18842/0:Helios has regained its Hub privileges.  Step into the infusion chamber, and the nanites in your body will be replicated in the air and ultimately in the bloodstreams of every last human being.
18843/0:We've got to find those Omar and eliminate them.  How dare they operate in Trier, where we are strongest.
18844/0:
18844/1:
18844/2:
18844/3:
18844/4:
18845/0:Let's hear it.
18846/0:This is the arcology's Outreach kiosk.  Any trouble, you can report it to me.
18847/0:The students have nothing to worry about.
18848/0:Alex -- a familiar face.  Just what I need.
18849/0:
18850/0:He's safe now.  My former classmate, Billie Adams, was plotting to destroy him, but she's no longer an issue.
18851/0:It's time for you to go.
18852/0:I'll do what I can.  Maybe something like that distraction I staged a few months ago to keep everyone away from the vault?  Listen, you should know the WTO is pestering me to join the Elite Committees again.
18853/0:What the hell are you doing?!  You're violating a WTO directive!
18854/0:You are contaminating my research!
18855/0:I guess business is a little slow because of the terrorist attack down the block.
18856/0:What's it to you?
18857/0:Who sent you?  It was that Pequod's jerk, wasn't it?  He isn't satisfied that he already has the zoning locked down for all of Upper Seattle and can keep me out.  He has to play like a mafia don and send people to harass me.  Well, I won't be intimidated!  I won't!
18858/0:It is good to be returned.
18859/0:A helicopter followed you here.  Tracer Tong sent it to pick me up from Area 51 after my infiltration of MJ-12.  Ava Johnson was the pilot, an AI construct.  I'm putting her at your disposal.  Go back to the surface and meet her at the abandoned VersaLife base.
18860/0:
18861/0:You better get out while you can.
18862/0:That's one thing about the WTO -- justice is swift.
18863/0:Dr. Nassif, how are you doing in the middle of all this?
18864/0:We are desperate people.
18865/0:What about you -- here to eliminate more of my men?  The Templars have given it a good start.  I was called in to help with this debacle... for all the good it did the SSC. 
18866/0:Stay true, young Pliable.  Now make sure that both Dentons have been killed, then step into JC Denton's machine inside the Statue so that the ducts will be primed with your nanite-capsid architecture.  My scientists will do the rest.
18867/0:You're right to be paranoid.  Stay here.  I'll let you know if I find out anything about the assassins.
18868/0:The Illuminati's power has no foundation other than the confused opinions of their followers.
18869/0:I've got some elite commandos down there skirmishing with paladins.  They've been instructed not to harm you.
18870/0:I hope you stick around Upper Seattle.  I could use the help.
18871/0:Our technology will change what it means to be human.  Conflict will be an anachronism.  The only danger is that our research could be stolen.  In the hands of a group like the Illuminati, it would be a weapon of unimaginable destructiveness.
18872/0:Pequod's is on the cutting edge of nutrition and biomedicine.  Our coffee will whiten your teeth and protect against ulcers.
18873/0:Alex -- how can murder these scientists so brutally?  They're defenseless!  And they only wanted to help you achieve your potential.  I know you must be angry, but killing them accomplishes nothing.
18874/0:
18875/0:That's no religion, that's a cult.  They lure weak-minded people to their meetings, then brainwash them into terrorists.
18876/0:We've got what we came for. 
18877/0:Get out!
18878/0:He's not my partner anymore.  We ran arms for a while, but then the Omar made a better offer.
18879/0:They wreck our factory, and I'M the one who gets locked up?
18880/0:Let's keep the familiarities to a minimum until we're sure you haven't been followed.  Agreed?
18881/0:
18882/0:Perhaps, someday, they'll be ready, and we'll finally be able to reveal our efforts.
18883/0:It's a little late for a seminar on my biomod architecture.
18884/0:I saw something.
18884/1:Did I see something?
18885/0:I saw something.
18885/1:Did I see something?
18886/0:Trier residents will be getting a new cup-o-Joe next month.  Pequod's has announced plans to open a branch in the downtown district.  In related news, the manager of the local Queequeg's has been sacked after starting an altercation with a WTO liason.  QueeQueg's corporate headquarters declined to comment on the incident.
18887/0:Hm.  I just bumped into something.
18887/1:I felt something there.
18888/0:Her Holiness said that I would be most useful in the medina, comforting our concerned believers.  Perhaps there is an operation planned against the arcology, but I did not inquire.  I trust Her Holiness to take appropriate action.
18889/0:(grunt) That hurt. //coldly enraged
18889/1:(grunt) That's not very nice. //coldly enraged
18890/0:What the -- ?  //mildly startled
18890/1:What on earth? //mildly startled
18891/0:Sorry -- just trying not to get left behind.
18892/0:Unconscious.
18892/1:Out cold.
18893/0:... dead.
18893/1:Oh the horror.  //world weary
18894/0:Stupid thing...
18894/1:Wonder why the silly thing's so upset...
18895/0:A generous offer.  I'll give it some thought.
18896/0:It's been damaged.
18896/1:How did this get wrecked? //aggravated
18897/0:A suspicious helicopter was circling the city.  Fortunately, both the pilot and the aircraft are now in WTO custody.
18898/0:The Templars are not murderers.  We just want what's best for humankind and realize that present circumstances demand sacrifices.  
18899/0:We're fortunate that the beacon's been activated.  Otherwise, I have no idea what would've happened to us.
18900/0:Seekers?  More like sneakers....
18901/0:There was a time when the details of governmental structure inspired lofty debates.  The empowerment of the judicial branch in the United States, an independent legislature, an elected executive... all the innovations that were eventually taken for granted by our ancestors.
18902/0:At least you're safe.  If I can do anything to make you feel more at home, let me know.
18903/0:He applied for a grant, you see.  I'm the one who handles that sort of thing for Upper Seattle.
18904/0:Who knew the summit would stir up this much trouble?
18905/0:The Omar spread like bacteria.  Now they're infecting the WTO enclaves.
18906/0:What's the problem?
18907/0:Something to do with "purification..."  Some group called the "Templars..."  I couldn't make sense of it, but I'm fairly certain that he didn't mean expulsion when he mentioned terminating students...  You can see for yourself.
18908/0:She's a human being, for God's sake.
18909/0:Will do.  Just calm down and let me request a team.
18910/0:Most people around here think that if you don't get accepted to an enclave, you must be lazy.  I'm not so sure about that...
18911/0:I will take you to the facility.  Realize, however, that I must minimize the danger to my helicopter.  I can't provide air cover or take unnecessary risks.
18912/0:Huh?
18912/1:Eh?
18912/2:Hello?
18913/0:Contact the receptionist if you'd like to schedule a parent-teacher conference.
18914/0:Just don't stand me up again.  It's not very nice.  So -- you must be here for the Summit.
18915/0:How 'bout those weapon mods you told me about?
18916/0:No problem.
18917/0:It's been destroyed.
18917/1:How did this get wrecked?  //aggravated
18918/0:At this hour, it's either The Greasel Pit bar or the Order Church, depending on your interests.
18919/0:This has been disabled.
18919/1:It's been shutdown.
18920/0:Her Holiness came to Trier to settle this peacefully.
18921/0:That's not right -- It's malfunctioning.
18921/1:I wonder if that's a hack?
18922/0:It's on.
18922/1:This was off.
18923/0:Maybe this is what it's all coming to -- no right or wrong, just choosing sides and hiring guns.
18924/0:It's off.
18924/1:This was on.
18925/0:It's open.
18925/1:This was closed.
18926/0:It's closed?
18926/1:This was open.
18927/0:Is someone throwing things?  //aggravated
18927/1:How did that happen?  //aggravated
18928/0:Where did it go?  //aggravated, impatient.
18928/1:It's missing.
18929/0:I can't wait to power up and show those modified freaks -- no offense -- the right way to enhance a soldier.
18930/0:How did that get there? //annoyed
18930/1:That's not where it should be...  //annoyed
18931/0:You believe everything you hear at a public terminal?  The media's controlled by the WTO.  Even this sorry scab standing next to me knows THAT.
18932/0:That one song isn't so bad, you know... Hum-um-hummm-mm-mm-um.  But most of her stuff has too much attitude for a guy like me.
18933/0:At last -- the moment is at hand.  Step into the device and let us exorcise that second soul of nanites.  You shall be reborn -- and so shall humanity.
18934/0:I don't think Miss Withers is going to be taking bribes anytime soon.
18935/0:Even though there are still Templars in Cairo, this should give us enough time to disappear.
18936/0:Better late than never, I suppose.  There are several ways to put an end to the Nassif family's illegal food production.  Destroying the filter system will kill the plants or you can destroy them directly.  You could also reprogram the software that automates the greenhouse.
18937/0:We've got a chance to make it now.
18938/0:A beauty, isn't it?
18939/0:One puppeted by the Illuminati.
18940/0:It's a lot of money.  We'll attract my husband's attention if I don't handle this properly.  He is pretty clueless, but has started asking questions about certain expenses....
18941/0:You're not supposed to be back here!
18942/0:Then we will take your blood by force.
18943/0:Depends on what you mean by "scrip'."
18944/0:Don't think I won't put up a fight!
18945/0:Be still and let Her Holiness into your heart.
18946/0:Looks like this area's seen action recently.
18946/1:There's been a battle.
18947/0:It's a trick.
18947/1:Can't fool me for long.
18948/0:(sigh) Ready as I'll ever be...  //weary
18948/1:I don't really want to have to do this... //annoyed
18949/0:Not again... //bored
18949/1:Once was enough... //bored
18950/0:Where's your gun? //
18950/1:Where's your weapon?
18951/0:Ugh.
18951/1:Unnf.
18952/0:Gotcha.
18952/1:Hey, it worked! //sarcastic
18953/0:Gotcha.
18953/1:Hey, it worked! //sarcastic
18954/0:I know all the tenants and you're clearly not one of them.  You better have honest business here.
18955/0:It's over.  //with grim delight
18955/1:That's finished.  //with grim delight
18956/0:Insolent fool.
18956/1:What a waste.
18956/2:You had to throw it all away...
18956/3:We had such high hopes for you...
18957/0:
18958/0:This is a Special Report from World News.  Coming on the heels of the Chicago disaster, the city of Seattle has been hit by a series of terrorist attacks.
18959/0:I've heard the name.  Not much more, though.
18960/0:According to the intel I've got, the Templars have her pinned down inside this facility.
18961/0:We're running out of energy here, so we're all going to have to make some sacrifices.  Survival first -- we can't justify diverting resources to any of our experiments anymore.  Namely, I think it may finally be time to stop the food supply to the grays.
18962/0:Almost got a break tonight.  Supposedly someone tried to murder the Champ.
18963/0:
18964/0:I was one of the Church's first disciples!
18965/0:Missed.  //a statement
18965/1:Oh no -- I missed! //sarcastic, unconcerned
18966/0:He's escaping. //calculating tone
18966/1:He's getting away. //calculating tone
18967/0:She moves to destroy JC.  We do not understand this violence against her own kind.
18968/0:She's escaping. //calculating tone
18968/1:She's getting away. //calculating tone
18969/0:If we learn to listen to each other, we can coexist peacefully.  The WTO fully supports freedom of thought and freedom of religion.
18970/0:Ha!
18970/1:Tsk tsk.
18971/0:Come out here! //enraged
18971/1:Stop hiding! //enraged
18972/0:We must carefully control access to the nanotechnology you possess.
18973/0:What can I say?  We all have our taste in coffee.
18974/0:Trouble in the Inclinator, but I heard they got that straightened out.
18975/0:Perhaps you're right.  May She forgive my doubt.  I grew up in post-Collapse Hong Kong.  My parents were Max Chen and Maggie Chow, conspirators involved wirh MJ-12.  My worst fear is that I'll give my allegiance to a deceptive cause.  May Order prevail.
18976/0:I appreciate that.  Listen, I'm serious.  You didn't hear the explosions?  I saw a guard killed right in front of me on the apartment level.
18977/0:(grunt) I've been hit. //matter of fact
18977/1:(grunt) I've been wounded. //matter of fact
18978/0:
18979/0:Umph... but it will take more than that.
18979/1:Oof.
18980/0:(groan)
18980/1:(groan) I can handle... this...
18981/0:Get too stringent about this sort of thing, and you end up with an unfriendly business enviironment.
18982/0:(grunt) I think... it's... poison...
18982/1:Oomph...
18983/0:(yells)
18983/1:Nooooo.  //in pain, but in control
18984/0:How's he able to control the weather?
18985/0:The missives said something about "Purification" -- I do not know what that means, but it sounds like he views the students here as inferior.
18986/0:I hate Calculus.
18987/0:Here you go.
18988/0:Oh?  Really?  That's hard to believe.  The SSC people keep this place air-tight.
18989/0:The WTO made the offer to hold talks in response to anti-WTO rioting in the Trier Panzerwerks factory.
18990/0:I know you probably didn't want to do that -- but thanks.
18991/0:(moan) Can't... see... //matter of fact
18991/1:(moan) I'm blind! //aggravated shout
18992/0:Your nanites are a feat of engineering and evolution.
18993/0:(groan)
18993/1:(groan)
18994/0:I thought you wanted to be a corporate heavy.
18995/0:I hope you rot in hell.
18996/0:(groan)
18996/1:(groan)
18997/0:I understand.
18998/0:(gasp)
18999/0:Scum!
18999/1:Plebe!
18999/2:Peon!
19000/0:This is real power. 
19000/1:You don't know who or what you're messing with.
19001/0:Our time will come... soon.
19001/1:The storm is gathering force.
19001/2:Soon... we will strike.
19001/3:Ah... Excellent... 
19001/4:I am above this.
19001/5:Why?
19002/0:(yawn)
19002/1:(cough)
19002/2:(sniff)
19002/3:(sneeze)
19003/0:I can't --
19003/1:Shhh...
19004/0:JC's vision two decades ago was far ahead of our means to implement it, but that is about to change.
19005/0:Right.... Jankowski.  It's great to finally meet you.
19006/0:First let's get you out of here.  I can't offer you much, but I was just repairing this silencer for Leo.  Maybe you could make use of it.
19007/0:How much?
19008/0:Head south up the hill from the Inclinator. The old factory's just southeast across the street.
19009/0:Alex, guess what I found out?  Your name has appeared in the WTO crime database.
19010/0:I guess I'm not the only one.  Are you still a prisoner of the WTO in Seattle?
19011/0:Oh dear.  I didn't mean to do that.
19011/1:I'm sorry.
19012/0:Nothing worthy of note.
19012/1:I haven't noticed a thing.
19013/0:I'm on duty right now.
19014/0:Terrorists... wonder what they want...
19015/0:Hello.
19015/1:Hi there.
19016/0:Hello.
19016/1:Hi there.
19017/0:Excuse me.
19017/1:Yes?
19018/0:Please watch where you're going. //caustic
19018/1:Please be more careful. //caustic
19019/0:You found me!  Hey, where's your suit?  You one of us?
19020/0:This is a restricted area. //caustic
19020/1:This zone is off-limits. //caustic
19021/0:Ummm... Hello? //caustic
19021/1:Please stop staring. //caustic
19022/0:Maybe you should go lie down.//caustic
19022/1:Perhaps you should take a nap. //caustic
19023/0:It's RED beams that trip alarms -- and green ones that trigger gas bombs.
19024/0:Like I said, those people are lucky to have jobs.  If they don't like the conditions, then they can work for someone else.
19025/0:Wait -- Do you know what's going on?
19026/0:We don't NEED to trust her, just keep her on a short enough leash.  As far as I'm concerned, she's just a trained beast.
19027/0:You jackass, that was the World Championship.  That stunt just INVALIDATED the whole thing.
19028/0:You bastard!
19029/0:Let's go.
19030/0:Then I think you have some explaining to do.
19031/0:Good idea.  Sneak past the main defenses.  I hope you have a multitool, though.  The Templars probably alarmed all of the entrances.
19032/0:I always knew Archer was a jerk, but I had no idea he was psychotic too.
19033/0:Oh, okay.  Well it is good to hear they are safe.  I will keep their secret.
19034/0:Protesters claimed that the vote had been somehow fixed and that the results did not reflect the will of the people, particularly those living outside the enclave.
19035/0:Too quick... It's not natural.
19036/0:Too quick... It's not natural.
19037/0:This guy can move!
19038/0:This guy can move!
19039/0:Hey, put that away.
19039/1:Get away from me.
19040/0:This chick can move!
19041/0:Hey!  Watch where you're aiming.
19041/1:Don't try my patience.
19042/0:This chick can move!
19043/0:Thought there might be some trade in refugees.  You know, quick hops away from trouble, but there hasn't been enough action yet for people to start liking my rates.  What about you?
19044/0:Please stop.  //hissing
19044/1:I am not amused. //hissing
19045/0:(grunt) Damn...
19046/0:Cut that out.
19046/1:Really. //droll
19047/0:(grunt)
19047/1:(grunt)
19047/2:(grunt)  ... got me...  // surprise
19047/3:(grunt) Damn...
19048/0:So you're getting a transfer?
19049/0:This area is restricted. //gathering force
19049/1:You are trespassing. //gathering force
19050/0:(grunt) He got me... // to self
19051/0:Really, I find this behavior irritating. //gathering force
19051/1:Stop looking at me. //gathering force
19052/0:(grunt) He got me... // to self
19053/0:Please take your antics elsewhere. //gathering force
19053/1:I am not impressed. //gathering force
19054/0:Stop it. //gathering force
19054/1:Get that away from me. //gathering force
19055/0:Now I just need to find this Sid Black.
19056/0:You don't want me as your enemy.
19056/1:I'm about to make a few 
19057/0:How dare you! //raging
19057/1:I've had just about enough of your insolence. //raging
19058/0:I wish the violence could've been avoided...
19059/0:Please -- I have preparations to make.
19060/0:They really want us to find true balance and order in our lives, which can only be possible when we're not being subjected to secret experiments.  
19061/0:Our most loyal customers are eligible to join the VIP club, upstairs.
19062/0:
19062/1:
19063/0:
19064/0:You want to hear more.  Good.  Let me explain how the Order should rebuild post-Collapse society.
19065/0:You weren't on the platform when that stuff spilled.  I don't even want to guess what it does to a person long-term.
19066/0:And the gate has only brought us destruction -- the Hateful Ones threaten, capture, and murder us.   We can neither fulfill our duties to JC, nor can we get to his habitat to awaken him.
19067/0:What's the connection to the Knights Templar?
19068/0:Well done.  Order is with us.
19069/0:I must return to my meditations now.
19070/0:
19071/0:(grunt) She got me...
19072/0:(grunt) She got me...
19073/0:(grunt) That's over the line!
19073/1:(grunt) Don't!  Please!
19074/0:(grunt) That's over the line!
19074/1:(grunt) Don't!  Please!
19075/0:And they don't even know it's coming, that something historic is about to happen to each and every one of them.
19076/0:You'll regret this! //raging
19076/1:That's it!  //raging
19077/0:You saved us!  What a couple of days.  First I see my daughter Mina saved from the plague by a miracle, now this.
19078/0:(scream)
19079/0:That's strange...
19080/0:Great place to meet chicks, huh?
19081/0:(grunt) I'm hurt!
19081/1:(grunt) This is getting out of hand!
19082/0:That's strange...
19083/0:(grunt) I'm hurt!
19083/1:(grunt) This is getting out of hand!
19084/0:Think I saw something...
19084/1:Hey -- uh... someone hiding over there?  // worried
19085/0:(grunt) He got me!
19086/0:Think I saw something...
19086/1:Hey -- uh... someone hiding over there?  // worried
19087/0:We've got a dangerous prisoner in custody.
19088/0:(grunt) He got me!
19089/0:Uh, think I saw something.
19090/0:Uh, think I saw something.
19091/0:Mmm?  What was that?
19091/1:That sounded a little suspicious...
19092/0:Mmm?  What was that?
19092/1:That sounded a little suspicious...
19093/0:Scrambler grenades -- give me those. [600]
19094/0:Uh, think I heard something.
19095/0:Wait here.  I'll be back.
19096/0:The terrorists reprogrammed our security, and that turret up there means business.  So we're trapped because the Order's out there, taking down scientists.
19097/0:I bet you think this is a big joke.
19098/0:Alex, the visitation room is just down the hall from where you saw me talking to the Luminon.  I'll see you there.
19099/0:I must look like an easy target -- a city official, drinking alone...
19100/0:Uh... yeah...
19101/0:(grunt) She got me!
19102/0:I've heard that there are groups within the church that want to take even more drastic action.
19103/0:Then be sure you talk to Chief Morgan as soon as you can.  She's in Europe right now, but she'll address you from the holocomm in her office.  Go up the stairs, hang a right, and look for the management wing on your left.
19104/0:(grunt) She got me!
19105/0:Is he guilty?  Why is he being accused?
19106/0:Didn't Commander Maxwell give you a key to the gate in the courtyard?  Oh well -- if you'd rather fight your way through a greasel nest, I guess I can't stop you.
19107/0:(grunt) It's too much for me!
19107/1:(grunt) It got a piece of me!
19108/0:It's those R and D guys pulling late nights that bring in the numbers.
19109/0:(grunt) It's too much for me!
19109/1:(grunt) It got a piece of me!
19110/0:(grunt) Felt that one...
19110/1:Aagh!
19110/2:(grunt) Oh, God...
19110/3:(defiant growl)
19111/0:Uh, think I heard something.
19112/0:(grunt) Felt that one...
19112/1:Aagh!
19112/2:(grunt) Oh, God...
19112/3:(defiant growl)
19113/0:Aaa!  Ran into something...
19114/0:(grunt) I'm not doing so hot
19114/1:(grunt) The psycho's gonna kill me!
19115/0:Aaa!  Ran into something...
19116/0:I would, I WOULD, but what would happen to him if I got the plague?  No, I can't.
19117/0:So the Illuminati wants to maintain disparity?
19118/0:Glad you're enjoying yourself.
19119/0:(grunt) I'm not doing so hot
19119/1:(grunt) The psycho's gonna kill me!
19120/0:(grunt) Who's there?  What do you want?  // panic
19120/1:(grunt) What the -- what's goin' on?
19121/0:(moan)
19121/1:(moan)
19121/2:(moan) Oh, Lord...
19121/3:(moan) No... no!  // panic
19122/0:(grunt) Who's there?  What do you want?  // panic
19122/1:(grunt) What the -- what's goin' on?
19123/0:(moan)
19123/1:(moan)
19123/2:(moan) Oh, Lord...
19123/3:(moan) No... no!  // panic
19124/0:(grunt) We're bein' ambushed!
19124/1:(grunt) Jeez, I'm being attacked!
19125/0:(grunt) We're bein' ambushed!
19125/1:(grunt) Jeez, I'm being attacked!
19126/0:Wonderful, the device is operational.  Now, Alex.  Simply take a deep breath and step inside.  I'm willing to bet that this thing actually works.
19127/0:Wow!
19128/0:Wow!
19129/0:... just bumming around, you know.
19130/0:Tell me this ain't happening...
19131/0:I paid your fine to Sophia Sak.  You're free to pick up your jet from the landing pad.
19132/0:But how could she support the WTO?
19133/0:I owe you my life.  My career is saved!  Let me show you those weapon mods I was talking about -- an Ammo Scavenger, a Fragmentary Rounds Mod, and a Glass Destabilizer. I got them off an Omar who was crucified at the end of the street.  Gruesome scene.  The work of the Templars, I'm sure.
19134/0:I'm here to make sure you keep your mouth shut about Lt. Archer's project.
19135/0:This school was once an ApostleCorp operation.  The Knights Templar must have penetrated their organization some time ago.  I need you to investigate the secret ApostleCorp suite that the Templars discovered.  Your objective will be to locate Dr. Nassif and interrogate her.
19136/0:At least I don't feel guilty drinking Queequeg's coffee.
19137/0:(groan) Don't kill me!
19137/1:(groan) You're gonna do it, aren't ya?  // desperate
19137/2:(groan) I'm just someone in your way, huh?  Just a nobody...
19138/0:(groan) Don't kill me!
19138/1:(groan) You're gonna do it, aren't ya?  // desperate
19138/2:(groan) I'm just someone in your way, huh?  Just a nobody...
19139/0:Look.  Bodies everywhere, mercenaries fighting over a few wires in the ground.  And this place used to be a symbol of freedom.
19140/0:(groan) Oh God, it's got me...
19141/0:(groan) Oh God, it's got me...
19142/0:(groan) Crazy way to die...
19142/1:(groan) I'm hurt really bad.
19143/0:Tell me this ain't happening...
19144/0:(groan) Crazy way to die...
19144/1:(groan) I'm hurt really bad.
19145/0:Must be some sort of trick.
19145/1:What the -- oh, I get it.
19146/0:Enough talk.  You've put us in danger by coming here.
19147/0:Aaaa!
19147/1:Some kind of toxin!
19148/0:Must be some sort of trick.
19148/1:What the -- oh, I get it.
19149/0:Aaaa!
19149/1:Some kind of toxin!
19150/0:Don't fall for it!
19151/0:(scream)
19151/1:(scream)  Put it out!  Somebody!
19152/0:Don't fall for it!
19153/0:(scream)
19153/1:(scream)  Put it out!  Somebody!
19154/0:Too much.... smoke!
19155/0:Too much.... smoke!
19156/0:A-ha!  Tryin' to get me to look the wrong way, huh?
19157/0:A-ha!  Tryin' to get me to look the wrong way, huh?
19158/0:I came here to kill you.
19159/0:Must've been some fighting...
19159/1:Jeez, looks like a war zone...
19160/0:Me?  I'm the utility manager on the first floor.
19161/0:Maybe if they knew that I'm sick, they'd let me in.
19162/0:Yes indeed... I want to stay on their radar.  An ex-Pequod's employee told me the code to their safe: 34-45-1-23.  You look like the mercenary type.  Maybe you would like to slip into the arcology and empty it for me.  Your payment would be the contents of the safe.
19163/0:JC will be wondering where I am.
19164/0:Her Holiness first ran into trouble by taking a more moderate line toward scientific research.
19165/0:
19166/0:And?
19167/0:They can tell that I already had one of the biomod treatments -- They will kill me!  I know it!
19168/0:We are, but first the clam must give up its pearl.  Good luck, Denton.  I will call on you when the time comes.  In case you need a pilot to take you to the compound, the Nine Worlds Tavern is a good place to hire one.
19169/0:I hate to say it, but I think she's leaning towards a QueeQueg's endorsement.
19170/0:Damn!  My eyes...
19170/1:I'm blinded!
19171/0:Damn!  My eyes...
19171/1:I'm blinded!
19172/0:I hear ya.  Have something specific in mind?
19173/0:Nice try.
19173/1:Whew!  Just grazed me.
19173/2:Guess I lucked out there...
19174/0:Nice try.
19174/1:Whew!  Just grazed me.
19174/2:Guess I lucked out there...
19175/0:Oh!
19175/1:(grunt)
19176/0:I never thought I'd see the day when Saman would order us to let a freak pass, let alone trust one with an important mission.
19177/0:I'll pay you back someday -- I promise!
19178/0:Oh!
19178/1:(grunt)
19179/0:(moan)
19179/1:(moan)
19179/2:(moan)
19180/0:(moan)
19180/1:(moan)
19180/2:(moan)
19181/0:(moan) Oh God...
19181/1:(moan) I'm not gonna make it... (gasp)
19182/0:I didn't go to the WTO.  The only person I told about the Omar in the VIP area was NG Resonance.  Her simulation, the hologram in the club.
19183/0:(moan) Oh God...
19183/1:(moan) I'm not gonna make it... (gasp)
19184/0:What do you mean?
19185/0:There's a dead body in the storeroom.
19186/0:Pequod's -- coffee for a new generation.
19187/0:We welcome everyone to transact, but any hostilities will be met with force.
19188/0:
19189/0:Matter clip's always useful, but I can't afford it. [400]
19190/0:If they really did run away, their friends would know where they are, but no one seems to have any idea...  It's kinda got everyone spooked.
19191/0:Just sayin' goodbye to my girl.  Always chokes me up a little.
19192/0:What about the Illuminati and ApostleCorp?  Won't they find a way to reverse your work?
19193/0:(gasp)
19194/0:(gasp)
19195/0:Fine by me.
19195/1:I'm ready...
19195/2:I'll do what I've got to do.
19195/3:I've been in worse situations.
19196/0:Fine by me.
19196/1:I'm ready...
19196/2:I'll do what I've got to do.
19196/3:I've been in worse situations.
19197/0:We can handle this.
19197/1:No sweat --  just back each other up.
19197/2:Whatever you've got, we're ready.
19198/0:We can handle this.
19198/1:No sweat --  just back each other up.
19198/2:Whatever you've got, we're ready.
19199/0:Wish I had more cash.  I'd bet more.  [500 credits.]
19200/0:Uh-oh...
19200/1:... gotta get through this...
19200/2:Ain't gonna be easy...
19200/3:Oh Jeez... // panic
19201/0:Uh-oh...
19201/1:... gotta get through this...
19201/2:Ain't gonna be easy...
19201/3:Oh Jeez... // panic
19202/0:Don't look now...
19202/1:We have our work cut out for us.
19203/0:
19204/0:Don't look now...
19204/1:We have our work cut out for us.
19205/0:
19206/0:Now that JC is awake, he will put things right.
19207/0:
19208/0:Then do it.
19209/0:Unbelievable.... They've deceived millions, hundreds of millions of people!  We can't let them get away with this!  Thank you.  You've saved me the hassle of hiring any more lawyers.  I hope you'll accept a small reward.
19210/0:
19210/1:
19211/0:You are a truly evil woman.  You are awakening a being of such power that the human race will have no choice but to kneel before it -- unless we can turn its power to our own purposes.  May God give you the wisdom to right your crooked path.
19212/0:2226 is some slimey lawyer.
19213/0:
19214/0:(scream)
19214/1:Have mercy, for God's sake!
19214/2:Oh, Jesus!
19214/3:I can't win...  // revelatory despair
19214/4:Just leave me alone!
19215/0:(scream)
19215/1:Have mercy, for God's sake!
19215/2:Oh, Jesus!
19215/3:I can't win...  // revelatory despair
19215/4:Just leave me alone!
19216/0:We're cooked...
19216/1:I don't want to risk my LIFE over it...
19216/2:Trouble!  Big Trouble!
19217/0:I saw you looking at me from across the room -- and then you walked right over.  How nice.  Ever since I became the enclave's Minister of Culture, most people treat me with a certain chilly deference.
19218/0:We're cooked...
19218/1:I don't want to risk my LIFE over it...
19218/2:Trouble!  Big Trouble!
19219/0:He's gonna kill us!
19220/0:He's gonna kill us!
19221/0:The Templars have taken the Mosque.  People seeking sanctuary there are now trapped.  The paladins are indifferent to them, but the security bot will shoot any non-Templars.  If you eliminated the bot, the people could probably escape.
19222/0:It's about time you quit being an assassin for a bunch of pseudoreligious mystics.  Locate Dr. Nassif and interrogate her.  The WTO wants to get to her before she reveals anything valuable to the Templar terrorists.  We think she may be holed up behind what remains of the ApostleCorp security system.
19223/0:She's gonna kill us!
19224/0:She's gonna kill us!
19225/0:Yes!
19225/1:There.
19225/2:One more like that...
19225/3:Just blowing you a kiss, baby...
19225/4:Hah!  Dead center!
19225/5:Feel THAT?
19226/0:Yes!
19226/1:There.
19226/2:One more like that...
19226/3:Hah!  Got you with that one...
19226/4:Bah-boom!
19226/5:Ping!
19227/0:Your first responsibility is to Templar HQ -- remember that.  I just spent two hours trying to convince our superiors that they haven't wasted millions on the power-armor research, even though you've leaked key design specs.
19228/0:The city of Trier, Germany is one of the oldest cities in Europe and will soon be the site of an historic meeting between the two largest political bodies to emerge since the Collapse.
19229/0:Finley, we're eternally grateful for your simplifying some of our commerce and transportation issues.  After what just happened in Chicago, however, we're much more concerned about security issues.  It might be a good idea to keep that recent delivery in storage for a bit longer.
19230/0:Trying to brainwash more mercenaries?
19231/0:I am ready to make an approach.  Use the pilot beacon near Flight Bay 23 to clear me for a landing.
19232/0:I heard about you guys.  Some sort of special ops unit, I guess.
19233/0:You monster!  How could you do this?  To your own family?!  After all ApostleCorp has given you, this is your thanks?  Get away from me.
19234/0:I'm looking for somebody.  That's all you need to know.
19235/0:Who made it?
19236/0:You just gave the world another twenty years of chaos.  You have broken from me completely.  Do not expect to leave the island alive.
19237/0:Move!  Get out of there -- gas!
19238/0:Responding to fire.
19238/1:Fire detected.
19239/0:
19240/0:Fire suppressed.
19241/0:Process aborted.
19241/1:Failed to complete task.
19242/0:Request denied.
19242/1:Authorization required for repair services.
19243/0:Your fate seated among the illuminated ones beckons.
19244/0:Saman has taken an interest in you.  He insisted that we let you live.
19245/0:Insufficient power.  Try again later.
19245/1:Status: recharging.
19246/0:That's what you get.
19246/1:... try and mess with ME...
19247/0:Internal damage.  Need repairs.
19248/0:That's what you get.
19248/1:... try and mess with ME...
19249/0:Systems (garble garble) error (garble) signal loss (garble)...
19250/0:Take that, jerk.
19251/0:Autonomous processing interrupted.
19252/0:Take that, jerk.
19253/0:Luminon Saman's inflammatory rhetoric is widely believed to have caused the recent unrest in Trier, Germany.  But did adherents to an extreme brand of Order philosophy in Europe carry out a strike in the center of the American heartland?
19254/0:Autonomous processing restored.
19255/0:Take that, lady.
19256/0:Systems shutting down.
19257/0:Take that, lady.
19258/0:I shot the weasel!
19259/0:I shot the weasel!
19260/0:He's not made of steel...
19260/1:There.  I softened him up for ya.
19261/0:Not now, friend.  We are discussing the crisis.  The Panzerwerks factory has erupted into a riot, and the violence is spreading.
19262/0:Yeah, as soon as the execs start talking money, I go right to sleep.
19263/0:He's not made of steel...
19263/1:There.  I softened him up for ya.
19264/0:Why'd they build it under the Black Gate?
19265/0:So you see yourself as a god?
19266/0:For a second I thought you were that guy who runs the Pequod's Coffeeshop downstairs.  The fool thinks that if he attacks me with a goofy grin I'll convince NG to endorse the franchise.
19267/0:Hi.  I'm NG Resonance.  One thing I can't stand is imitation.  That's why I'm so uncompromising with my music, and that's why I drink QueeQueg's.  A tall, foamy Queeqachino makes me feel good because I know it was made from real coffee beans grown the old way, organically, by independent farmers.  Pretty cool, huh?  Not to mention the edge it gives me before a big show.  I don't know what I'd do without my QueeQueg's.
19268/0:I could use a pilot.  I'll think about it.
19269/0:You lookin' for ME?  Huh?  You lookin' for LEO JANKOWSKI?  I'm probably in the rec area workin' out or already on a plane for HORDE RCP, Special Security Division... and I bet you wish it was you.  Huh, plebe?
19270/0:If you really want to talk to students, you should try somewhere without teachers around.
19271/0:I understand.
19272/0:Damage sustained.
19272/1:Chassis damaged.
19273/0:Damage significant.
19273/1:Primary circuits disrupted.
19274/0:
19275/0:Systems failing.
19275/1:Operations in jeopardy.
19276/0:Avoiding threat.
19276/1:Danger... danger...
19277/0:She's not made of steel...
19277/1:There.  I softened her up for ya.
19278/0:Shutdown.
19278/1:Fatal disruption.
19278/2:Cannot proceed.
19279/0:She's not made of steel...
19279/1:There.  I softened her up for ya.
19280/0:Requesting assistance.
19281/0:It's got a tough hide.
19282/0:Task scheduled.  Proceeding.
19283/0:It's got a tough hide.
19284/0:Operation normal.
19284/1:Diagnostics passed.
19285/0:So it's a brawl you want...
19285/1:(growl)
19285/2:You ain't so scary up close...
19286/0:Do I get a reward?
19287/0:So it's a brawl you want...
19287/1:(growl)
19287/2:You ain't so scary up close...
19288/0:I can handle myself better than I thought.
19288/1:Whew!
19288/2:Well!  That was quick.  // surprise
19288/3:Wow... this'll be my first takedown bonus.
19288/4:That's right -- the SSC plays for keeps!
19289/0:Good, you found the facility.  Transmit the specification to the WTO orbiting science platform, Ophelia, then you will be free to destroy that illegal machine inside the Statue.
19290/0:I can handle myself better than I thought.
19290/1:Whew!
19290/2:Well!  That was quick.
19290/3:Ha!
19290/4:SSC turned me into a killer.
19290/5:Cool.
19290/6:I thought this would be easy.
19290/7:Whew.  Thought I was a goner.
19290/8:It's over.  That's what matters.
19290/9:Hope there's a bounty for this one.
19291/0:There was concern that you might be lured away from the Illuminati.
19292/0:Mr. O'Rourke will pay.  He keeps his word.
19293/0:... gonna take over someday...
19293/1:Looks just like the one that ate my cat.
19294/0:... gonna take over someday...
19294/1:Looks just like the one that ate my cat.
19295/0:Looks like your old friend Billie is a little upset.  Hmmm.  I apologize if I've come between you two in some way.
19296/0:I'm listening.
19297/0:You're leavin' your scent on the playing field!
19298/0:You will appreciate our merchandise.  You may purchase now at market value, or redress an earlier affront to the Omar by performing a service for us.  This would earn you a discount.
19299/0:They think they own me.  Nobody owns Leo Jankowski.
19300/0:Meet us in New York.  Help us replace the social mechanism with a social organism -- one that is self-aware and can consciously evolve.
19301/0:Very well.
19302/0:This guy wants to talk to you about Sid.
19303/0:You scoping the place?  Working for Sid Black, maybe?
19304/0:I don't know... I think I'd better play it safe right now.
19305/0:I think I heard something.
19305/1:That's a weird noise.
19306/0:That doesn't look right.
19306/1:I think I saw something just then.
19307/0:Listen -- Her Holiness has much to teach us.
19308/0:Again?
19308/1:This is starting to get on my nerves.
19309/0:What's going on?
19309/1:What's that about?
19310/0:Ever since the strike at Panzerwerks, people have been treating my business as their own private amphitheater.
19311/0:I wonder what's up...
19311/1:That is so strange.
19312/0:Must be a professional job goin' down.
19312/1:Wonder if there's a bounty on this one...
19313/0:Hey!
19313/1:That's wrong.
19314/0:Must be a professional job goin' down.
19314/1:Wonder if there's a bounty on this one...
19315/0:I know --  it's overwhelming.  I've dedicated myself to the WTO, only to find out it's just a myth they created. 
19316/0:Something's definitely afoot.
19316/1:That's not right.
19317/0:That did it.
19317/1:I think that's a wrap.
19318/0:Exactly.  Your underlying mission will be to locate her.  If perfected, the biomod architecture she gave you, being adaptable to any host, could bring biomodification to everyone and unbalance the very concept of the human being.  But we have an additional favor to ask.
19319/0:They won't catch me sleeping.
19320/0:It would take thirty years to rebuild what Aquinas can give us in a few days.
19321/0:Oh no--
19321/1:Oh my--
19322/0:That did it.
19322/1:I think that's a wrap.
19323/0:If you want to even out the social order, you have to change the nature of power itself.  Right?  And what creates power?  Wealth, physical strength, legislation -- maybe -- but none of those is the root principle of power.
19324/0:Oh.
19325/0:Nevermind.
19325/1:I guess it was nothing.
19326/0:Guess that's the end of him.
19327/0:I think that trespasser took off.
19328/0:Guess that's the end of him.
19329/0:
19330/0:Guess that's the end of her.
19331/0:Guess that's the end of her.
19332/0:Ugly son of a bitch.
19333/0:Ugly son of a bitch.
19334/0:I won.  I think you owe me some money.
19335/0:You have a generous heart.  You would make a good Seeker, but Order has many enemies, and often appeasement only prolongs a problem.  Now go to the Greasel Pit bar and find Sid Black.  I bet he will be happy to take you to Mako.
19336/0:You're the best, Alex.  Don't worry -- I'll think of something.
19337/0:Help us strengthen our control.
19338/0:

19339/4:
19340/0:I cannot wait to start at Tarsus.  I even heard that they give you an operation to make you smarter -- for free!
19341/0:(bleeps)
19341/1:(hums)
19342/0:Stay clear.
19342/1:Accidental collision.
19342/2:Be advised: small bots in operation.
19343/0:You have bioelectic systems.  Feel free to access this station's functionality.
19343/1:Repair station, Class 2 automated device.
19343/2:Tasks will be processed in the order received.
19344/0:Tampering with my systems is a crime punishable by a fine not to exceed ten thousand credits.
19344/1:Minor infraction duly recorded.  Expect prosecution.
19344/2:A repair platform is not a toy.
19344/3:Caution: my servomechanical components are very delicate.
19345/0:Public repair platform.  Accepting task requests.
19345/1:Total repair solution guaranteed.  Systems updated twice daily from a global manufacturer knowledge-base.
19345/2:Need a repair?  Manufacturers recommend bots over mechanics ten-to-one.
19346/0:New repair tasks welcome.
19346/1:Greetings.
19347/0:Systems need repair.
19348/0:Got a problem?
19349/0:Subsumption (garble garble) error (garble) systems (squeal) error (bleep) error.
19350/0:
19351/0:Ceasing operation.
19352/0:Autonomous processing interrupted.
19353/0:Be careful of the automated turrets around here.  They're on a hair trigger.
19354/0:You can salvage nothing from that facility, because the conspriators are dead.  Hear me, Alex.  Go to the Statue and destroy the Denton machine.
19355/0:They have put us here with a badness in mind.
19356/0:Where are you going with this?
19357/0:They've got to impound the vehicle now, until they get to the bottom of this.  They must be interrogating the pilot.
19358/0:The people will welcome true equality.  Help me, Alex.  You've come this far toward restoring ApostleCorp.  Finish the job by rescuing my brother from the Templars in Cairo.
19359/0:Hear that?  He called Red a "punk..."
19360/0:Looks like I'm going to be working overtime.
19361/0:No, globally.  I was called in to help with this Templar debacle... for all the good it did the SSC.
19362/0:The Templars put a bounty on the Nassif family.  Maybe that's why you're here.
19363/0:Hard to believe that two people would attempt to reconstruct all of global society.
19364/0:What would your old friend, Billie, say?  Mmmm?
19365/0:Probably staged -- a test for the new transfers.  They rewrote the exercises because of my performance.  If there was trouble, they'd notify me immediately.
19366/0:Your cavalier attitude toward human life is disgusting...  I should have expected as much after you failed us in New Cairo.  I really wish you would reconsider your allegiances.
19367/0:Autonomous processing restored.  Scanning for source of disruption.
19368/0:Processing anomaly...
19368/1:Signal disruption.
19369/0:Processing...
19369/1:Pursuing additional data.
19370/0:Sonic disruption.
19370/1:Sound unidentified.
19371/0:Additional data.  Assessing...
19371/1:Reassessing potential threat.
19372/0:Investigating specific threat.
19372/1:Likely intrusion.
19373/0:Be advised.  Force has been authorised.
19373/1:Encounter probable.
19374/0:Visual inconclusive.
19375/0:Investigating sound.
19375/1:Compound waveform -- likely presence of intruder.
19376/0:Wrong suite.  Sorry.
19377/0:If you have the key, it means you've been okayed by security to access the rest of Trier.
19378/0:From here out, you deal directly with Sid.
19379/0:
19379/1:
19380/0:It is not clear.  It seems they are trying to learn more about us, but in gravely vicious ways. Right now, there is one of our number in captivity.  If you could help him reach this location, it would mean a great deal to us.
19381/0:You also know that Queequeg's Coffee imports exclusively from independent coffee growers from around the world.
19382/0:It took years of research and testing, but now we've got the cure.
19383/0:I had a bar in Lower Seattle before the WTO created this high-class enclave.  The crimelords down there were pussycats compared to what I have to deal with here.
19384/0:He's been watching me for almost a week.  I'm glad he finally took the bait.
19385/0:
19385/1:
19385/2:
19386/0:It's some sort of utopian vision they have -- a society based on absolute equality.  Meanwhile, everyone wants a piece of the technology, including the Order and WTO, which are both puppets of a contemporary incarnation of the Illuminati, believe it or not.  And of course the Templars want to destroy it.
19387/0:Warning: restricted area.
19388/0:Threat detected.
19388/1:Readiness level maximum.
19389/0:Watch yourself.
19390/0:Attention.  Remove yourself immediately.
19390/1:Unauthorized organic.
19391/0:You have violated this zone's security provisions.
19392/0:Responding.  Scenario uncertain.
19392/1:Surveillance failure.  Taking emergency measures.
19393/0:Seeking origin of the assault.
19393/1:Warning: threats to operation incur appropriate countermeasures.
19394/0:No more excuses about your grandfather.  The plague is gone.  Look at the sky!
19395/0:Unexpected collison.  Processing...
19396/0:Situation unprecedented.  Significance unclear.
19397/0:Deception attempt detected.
19398/0:Indeed, the people here are very devout.
19399/0:You are a truly evil woman.  You are awakening a being of such power that the human race will have no choice but to kneel before it -- unless we can turn its power to our own purposes.  May God give you the wisdom to right your crooked path.
19400/0:What do enclave dwellers think of all this?
19401/0:I'm from the Tarsus program.  Dr. Nassif would want me to be taken back into custody.
19402/0:You there.  Hey!
19403/0:Huh.  My ears aren't what they used to be.
19403/1:I heard SOMETHING...
19404/0:I asked one guard if I could help -- you know, zap Archer with the stun prod a few more times -- but he wasn't too keen on that.
19405/0:Hm, bumped into something...
19406/0:I guess I shouldn't be saying any of this -- they don't even know if they can trust you.
19407/0:(grunt) Hell, I'm bein' AMBUSHED!
19407/1:(grunt) Who's there?!  You better stand down.  
19408/0:Seen that one before...
19408/1:You might've gotten away with that against a rookie...
19409/0:You get to do the honors.
19410/0:That's blood all right.
19411/0:Hm.  Something crossed in front of the light.
19412/0:My foster parents.
19413/0:Must've been a standoff here.
19413/1:The fighting seems to have tapered off.
19414/0:Fire, probably some sort of diversion.
19414/1:Someone's setting fires...
19415/0:Sounds ignored.  Possible deception.
19416/0:You don't see that too often in a championship.  A draw.  Here's your money back.
19417/0:Get out before I shoot the messenger.
19418/0:
19418/1:
19418/2:
19419/0:Tracking creature disturbance.
19420/0:Creature is burning.
19421/0:Logging animal corpse.
19422/0:Residue classification: weapon damage.
19423/0:Investigating device malfunction.
19424/0:Tarsus continues to provide the best educational opportunities.
19425/0:Another lucky night...
19426/0:Investigating disabled device.
19427/0:How'd you find out I was in Cairo?
19428/0:Investigating moving object.
19429/0:There are no more in Cairo.  They've all been terminated.
19430/0:Doesn't bother ME.  Only time I went up the Inclinator was when I got arrested.
19431/0:Investigating missing object.
19432/0:Cut it out!
19433/0:Investigating displaced object.
19434/0:I will notify my friend at the morgue.   Mmm, lovely.  The Omar are hungry for another sweet-meat surprise...
19435/0:If you're ready to leave, just head out, and the sensors will automatically reactivate everything.
19436/0:No one chooses to live here.
19437/0:Help me defend the human body, Alex.  It's our last refuge from the conspiracy of materials known as technology -- and from the all-too-human greed that gives it life.
19438/0:All that training and look at you -- shakin' from head to toe.
19439/0:Famous last words.
19440/0:I'd really like to hear about my home town.
19441/0:So you have a theory about the Inclinator disaster?
19442/0:Something must be burning.
19443/0:Someone killed a mutant.
19444/0:Imagine how much money the executives of the parent company must make.  If I play my cards right, that is where my career ladder will take me.
19445/0:Oh -- is that a biomod canister?  Thanks.
19446/0:Some sort of commotion...
19447/0:That damage looks recent.
19448/0:Hey, better watch the feebspeak around the Pit, or these scabs -- not me, of course -- but these other scabs might take advantage.  Know what I'm sayin'?
19449/0:I'll give you enough cash for a leather jacket.  Just don't hurt me. [100]
19450/0:Hm.  Completely destroyed.
19451/0:Wait here.  I'll be back.
19452/0:Hm.  Malfunctioning...
19453/0:Hm.  It's been disabled.
19454/0:
19455/0:Someone must've turned it on.
19456/0:The mastermind behind Chicago has no such adaptability.
19457/0:Someone must've turned it off.
19458/0:Someone turned on the light.
19459/0:I'm a diplomat, Brett.  Her Holiness and I --
19460/0:We've been with the program since we were thirteen years old.  Why are you so quick to abandon that?  What can the Order offer you?
19461/0:A good cause.  Let me see your finger.
19462/0:
19463/0:I am just a simple woman.
19463/1:Have faith.  Faith is the best medicine.
19463/2:Save your pity.
19463/3:It's hard, but I manage...
19464/0:Sure, you see a lot more mutants around, but they aren't a threat to humanity or anything.
19465/0:The Omar do not take such actions lightly.  Had you aided us in the past, all alliances would now be nullified, but no such connection exists.
19466/0:Just go to the entrance to the terraformer bay and I'll transmit the code.
19467/0:Our orders are to let you pass... against my better judgment.
19468/0:Here you go.  You're the one with combat training.  Please handle the intruders before they reach my companion and me.
19469/0:
19470/0:This is a security alert.  We have information on a possible external threat to this campus.  As always, discuss your work with no one outside the company.  Communicate electronically only on the Mako network.  And starting now -- no visitors.  Our automated systems won't care whether it's a suicide bomber or your grandma.  Be safe.  Now let's make a great weapon.
19471/0:Just trying to be helpful.
19472/0:
19473/0:Someone turned off the light.
19474/0:The WTO is reviewing the Templars' duties and tariffs payments, so they've dispatched me to do a proper audit.  They may put on a show of amicability, but every time I try to actually SEE what's in that hangar, I get the runaround.
19475/0:That wasn't open before...
19476/0:That wasn't closed before...
19477/0:Straight at her, Green!  Atta-boy!
19478/0:Unconscious.... Hm.
19479/0:Hm, dead.  I don't like it.
19480/0:(sigh)  Someone sure did a number on him.
19481/0:(sigh)  Someone sure did a number on her.
19482/0:Who's throwing things around...?  // annoyed
19483/0:It seems to be gone.
19484/0:That wasn't there...
19485/0:
19486/0:Right, but you've been working for both the WTO and Order, so the jury's still out on whether I can even trust you.  I will warn you that I suspect the Order may want Nassif dead, but the WTO doesn't believe in vigilantism and I plan to enforce the law, no matter who threatens Nassif or why.  We need her alive AND conscious for quick information extraction.
19487/0:Our agents approached your parents, Klara, while you were still in utero because of certain genetic potentials we detected during your mother's prenatal exams.  Seizing upon this opportunity, we began the infusion process immediately, before you were even born.
19488/0:Saman's a serious man.  In a year he'll be running the world.  To do that requires more than grunts like us.  He'll need infrastructure.  I think that's what this is all about.
19489/0:Won't be long before one cult or another tries to force itself on EVERYBODY.  You better drink to that, young sir.
19490/0:Grateful?  Miscommunication?  They were shooting at us!
19491/0: In any event, we've located the facility, positioned the powered armor troopers and begun excavation.
19492/0:It'll be great to get out of here and back to a normal assignment.
19493/0:
19494/0:Well, don't be intimidated by my ranking.  I make a point of treating every team member as an equal.
19495/0:Isn't the Pequod's in the arcology closed?
19496/0:At least they got the helicopter on the ground with no problems.
19497/0:We want him dead, not asleep.  To be a seeker, you must shun timidness of action.
19498/0:It's a hard time for the Church, but this is when Her Holiness needs your support.  Tell her your concerns.  She will put your mind at ease.
19499/0:What I'm about?  Takeback.  Take back our streets.  Take back our bodies.  Take back our minds.
19500/0:One guy said Piezochem was shipping their waste to Lower Seattle.  Heh heh.  It would blend right in.
19501/0:Not if you're careful.  Just stick to the shadows, crouch, and move slowly.  You'll come through just fine.
19502/0:High Augur Chen is a fine Seeker.  She has a strong heart, but a strong heart often runs contrary to a Seeker's purpose.
19503/0:Hm...
19503/1:Strange...
19504/0:Sorry.  I guess I blew it.
19505/0:Good thing there's two of us.  We can watch each other's backs.
19506/0:Well!  Maybe it IS something...
19506/1:This better not keep up.
19507/0:
19508/0:I've tapped into the terminal's local network.  The passcode to the hangar holding my vehicle is 00485.  Get me out of here, and I'll fly you anywhere you want -- free of charge.
19509/0:Huh.  Now what?
19509/1:It must be back...
19510/0:The Headmaster has this bizarre secret office, with files on all the students and communications with someone outside Tarsus.
19511/0:Must be nothing.
19511/1:Could've been anything.
19512/0:What I'm about?  Takeback.  Take back our streets.  Take back our bodies.  Take back our minds.
19513/0:Damn, slipped away...
19513/1:Lucky beggar...
19514/0:Damn, he got away.
19515/0:Damn, she got away.
19516/0:Well.  The next assault won't be so easy...
19517/0:The killer's gone.  A shame.  A real shame.
19518/0:Damn, looks like the thief disappeared.
19519/0:The whole reason I joined the Order was to get away from factory-model thinking.
19520/0:It isn't often that a man finds a cause worth dying for.
19521/0:I need a miracle to save my job.  Please find a way to get that NG endorsement.
19522/0:Got a problem, son?
19523/0:Not bad for a man my age, huh?
19524/0:What do you think you're doing?!
19525/0:You had better take another look at the main chamber.  You were just teleported almost a half a mile.  I'm not surprised, though.  I was able to construct the Black Gate teleporter only with instructions from Helios.
19526/0:How's it goin'?
19526/1:Never mind ME.
19526/2:Just keepin' busy, you know.
19526/3:Another busy day.
19527/0:I talked to Chairman Dumier and he gave me the key.
19528/0:Not important, so long as it knows how to keep Order...
19529/0:Thanks -- I promise not to break it.
19530/0:
19531/0:You bastard!
19532/0:Whoever it is also helped the Templars kidnap Her Holiness during a meeting with the Panzerwerks union.  They are holding her at the Black Gate laboratory.  I'm going to give you the code to a secret entrance, which is in a room on the second floor of the east tower... 2521.  Look for a keypad hidden behind some crates.
19533/0:Security squad M7 to the main entrance immediately.
19534/0:
19534/1:
19534/2:
19534/3:
19535/0:Our intel was out of date and we were just outnumbered.  The SSC never trained for large-scale operations.  I guess this is our wake-up call.
19536/0:Better take a look.
19536/1:Only one way to get to the bottom of this...
19536/2:Somebody up to something?
19537/0:Do not push your luck.  Leave me alone.
19538/0:Work with our charming co-conspirators just a little while longer.  When you have the Sequencing Module for the gate, you will be free to contact JC on your own.
19539/0:Come out in the open.  That's an order.
19539/1:Fool.  Do you have any idea who I am?
19539/2:I always get my mouse.
19540/0:A way to level the playing field between rich and poor.  A society is no better than the individuals it contains.  If all of them can be healthy, intellectually gifted, and self-reliant, the prospects for liberty look much better than they did early in the century.
19541/0:Now I've got you!
19541/1:I know just how to handle this...
19542/0:I guess you're not a disciple of the Order.
19543/0:Are you kidding?  Without a haz mat suit?
19544/0:Hey, you!
19545/0:You won't get away!
19545/1:NOW you did it.
19545/2:I'm right on your tail...
19546/0:Step into the chamber.  It's time.
19547/0:Aaaa!
19547/1:Holy--
19548/0:You should take the biomod canister before it is purchased by another customer.
19549/0:Gotcha!  I'm a little quicker than the regulars...
19549/1:Now what're you gonna do?
19549/2:I think you're caught.
19550/0:Time to drop this beggar...
19551/0:Thought you could get away, huh?
19551/1:Coward.
19551/2:Enough games.
19551/3:This is starting to get old.
19552/0:Better draw your weapon.
19553/0:I don't know where she is, but she better show up soon.  The facility here is being raided by the Templars.  So far we're holding our own, but I don't know how much longer that will last.  This may be my last transmission...
19554/0:Your bravery will be rewarded.
19555/0:100% detox complete.
19556/0:Don't forget my bird has Sunfire missiles.  I can't do much against the arcology pyramid, but for a few more creds I might be able to help you out in New York.
19557/0:Either way, biomodification's about to become a thing of the past, and that's what matters.
19558/0:You're quite near the captured gray that their leader was talking about.  Save the poor creature, or the Templars will vivisect him to learn about the grays' vulnerabilities.
19559/0:(static) ...has suffered critical failure... (static)
19560/0:I've decided that you might be going in the right direction.
19561/0:
19561/1:
19561/2:
19562/0:
19563/0:Later, lady.
19564/0:That's right.  You're dancin' with 'Zilla.  Come on, baby, you know the step!
19565/0:Easy shot...
19565/1:There.
19565/2:I'm a pretty steady shot.  // warning
19566/0:I guess you get to where you like whatever you're accustomed to.
19567/0:Forget that.  How do you know they won't just cut us loose, given all this trouble at their facilities?  Grab what you can NOW -- get your biomods installed -- Tarsus owes us that much.  I got mine and they're worth the trouble.  
19568/0:I need armor!  Go!  Go!  Go!
19569/0:Better call in a bot.
19570/0:Perfect job for a drone...
19571/0:Tomorrow night, same time, same place.  There's always new meat in the Pit.
19572/0:Too late for runnin' away...
19572/1:Hit and run, huh?
19572/2:Don't worry -- I'll flush you out...
19573/0:At least you know when you're beat.
19573/1:You're not getting off that easy...
19573/2:They always want to run for it.
19574/0:What's the matter?  I'm standing right here.
19574/1:You're gonna have to do better than that.
19574/2:Close...
19575/0:I've got to stop worrying about them.  I really need to stay focused on my studies.
19576/0:The biomod's too pricey for me. [1000]
19577/0:You mean... all of them?
19578/0:What?  Are you his girlfriend?  Let's see the money.  Hm.  Okay, then.  I guess we can find someone else.
19579/0:I'm sure it means the apocalypse is coming, just like my aunt always warned.
19580/0:Oh...  really...  you're a graduate?
19581/0:Hasten to your destiny.
19582/0:Liberty in the abstract, or so I thought.  I was a reckless child back then, running a gang of revolutionaries.  We thought we loved freedom, but mostly we loved the sound of our own voices.
19583/0:The Order steals our equipment to make us shut down the assembly line.   His church has been doing this for months and we are sick of it.
19584/0:Fed up with what they believe to be the pollution of the human genome by biomodification, and frustrated with the general public's refusal to respond to their message, the Templars have instead taken Cairo by force and by all accounts intend to enact their agenda through a military state.
19585/0:I wish there was something I could do.
19586/0:Must be some sort of biomod.
19586/1:This isn't the first time I've fought someone who's modified.
19587/0:Let's hang out again sometime!
19588/0:(grunt)
19588/1:(grunt)
19589/0:How stupid do you think we are?  Every day we hear the Order accuse Panzerwerks of poisoning the river.
19590/0:(groan)
19590/1:(groan)
19591/0:(moan)
19591/1:(moan) No...
19592/0:Target's on the move!
19592/1:Oh no you don't -- I'm not letting you off so easy.
19593/0:(gasp) (cough)
19594/0:Welcome to Club Vox.
19595/0:(scream)
19596/0:Target's on the move!
19596/1:Oh no you don't -- I'm not letting you off so easy.
19597/0:I'd pay a little extra for the good stuff, sure.
19598/0:(groan) I can't see!
19599/0:Was that supposed to hurt?
19600/0:
19601/0:What about you?
19602/0:(groan)
19603/0:
19604/0:You picked the wrong person to mug, punk.
19605/0:(groan) Damn you!
19606/0:I'll bet that your intruders are Billie Adams, along with some Templar back-up.  After that, I have no idea what you're talking about.
19607/0:I'm studying for a test.  Do you mind?
19608/0:I wouldn't be so quick to trust Luminon Saman.
19609/0:The Order is spiritually rich, but that doesn't buy many private jets.  Go to the Greasel Pit bar.  You shouldn't have any trouble finding a pilot there.
19610/0:Sometimes my family does not understand my devotion.
19611/0:A sign of the times.  A business conceals its name, and no one looks twice.
19612/0:Thank you.  That buys my studio another month of life.
19613/0:Target's on the move!
19613/1:Oh no you don't -- I'm not letting you off so easy.
19614/0:You need an economic base to run a war.
19615/0:He's getting away!
19616/0:I don't know...  I just freeze up whenever I try to mix business and pleasure.
19617/0:Never thought I'd see people DIE.
19618/0:He's getting away!
19619/0:He's getting away!
19620/0:I've got a black-market biomod canister, enables non-Piezochem functionality.  If you choose this item, we will direct you to a drop site for it after you have paid. Or you could take three scrambler grenades, which produce viral electronic transmission that affects bots, and temporarily switches their alliances.  And I've also got five multitools, used to bypass security devices, like keypads, cameras, and turrets, and to pick electronic locks.  As a preferred customer, you may purchase items at half-market price.
19621/0:He won't escape from us that easily.
19622/0:(grunt)
19623/0:He won't escape from us that easily.
19624/0:Have faith in the Order.  All will be well.
19625/0:(sigh)
19626/0:He won't escape from us that easily.
19627/0:I know enough -- You're on assignment from the Templars to "purify" this school, you monster.
19628/0:That's right -- it's for real.
19628/1:Guess you felt that one.
19628/2:What did you expect, huh?
19629/0:She's getting away!
19630/0:You reconsidered.  Good.  Come to the -- Wait!  Must be an overload... or a self-destruct sequence.  A blast door just sealed off the only exit.  You'll be trapped unless you can kill the power with the control box on the south wall -- or destroy the exposed conduits.  I should've known old Alex Jacobson would have a surprise waiting for unauthorised users...
19631/0:Good clean shot.
19631/1:My aim just gets better.
19632/0:Glad that's taken care of.
19632/1:I think that does it.
19632/2:I'm happy we could find a diplomatic solution.
19632/3:Textbook takedown.  Hm, could make good instructional material, if one of the cameras caught it.
19633/0:She's getting away!
19634/0:Retribution is inevitable.  Retribution against Club Vox.
19635/0:She's getting away!
19636/0:Damn...
19636/1:Losing my touch.
19636/2:Missed my chance...
19637/0:Come on.  Take a shot.
19637/1:Now we play by MY rules.
19637/2:They gave me command for a reason, you know.
19638/0:I keep an eye on the troublemakers.
19639/0:Back in your hole, beggar.
19640/0:They have driven the SSC troops back and have set up their own bases and patrols.  In the mosque alone, they have regular troops, some guys in weird armor, and even a bot.  
19641/0:This is the part where you try to make a break for it.
19641/1:What't the matter?  Not turning out like you planned?
19641/2:Funny way to die.  I guess you've got your reasons.
19642/0:Don't forget to come see me at the Order church, Alex.  That landing pad is run by a local smuggler, Sophia Sak.  Looks like they've seized Sid Black's harrier -- probably as payment for phony debts.  It never hurts to have a pilot who owes you a favor.  You could pay the debt or -- better -- eliminate Sak and her henchmen for the good of the whole neighborhood.
19643/0:(grunt)
19643/1:(grunt)
19644/0:Time again for a.... ta-a-alk BULLET!
19645/0:Even in winter, it doesn't get this cold.
19646/0:I messed up on crowd-control.  That's why they have me on light-fixture duty.
19647/0:
19648/0:I already killed a lawyer in the Emerald Suites.
19649/0:Just move along so we can seal off the area.
19650/0:Sheila, we're still waiting on that inventory audit.  In particular, we need numbers for servomechs, energy clips, rotator bearings, and coffee from your department.
19651/0:That's quite an extrapolation for a pop-star chatter-bot.
19652/0:Your grandfather wants to shut you up until you're old and scared of life like him.
19653/0:As you know, the Illuminati has imperceptibly guided civilization for centuries.  How?  Leadership.  We elevate the capable into positions of authority, where they can do the most good for everyone.  JC and Saman both want to level the social order, either by giving biomods to everyone or no one.  It's the same either way -- the end of true leadership and a descent into chaos.
19654/0:Help us put the world back together, Alex.
19655/0:We will bring you more details on these events as they become available.
19656/0:You think Leo Jankowski can't protect himself?
19657/0:She won't escape from us that easily.
19658/0:Here -- take the silencer.  It's not doing me any good.
19659/0:She won't escape from us that easily.
19660/0:She won't escape from us that easily.
19661/0:(laughs)  You weren't really trying, were you? //sarcastic
19661/1:Bah!  Nice aim!  //sarcastic
19662/0:Vmail sender replied:
19663/0:(laughs)  You weren't really trying, were you? //sarcastic
19663/1:Bah!  Nice aim!  //sarcastic
19664/0:Incoming!

19666/0:(laughs)  You weren't really trying, were you? //sarcastic
19666/1:Bah!  Nice aim!  //sarcastic
19667/0:Right.  Well, I'll take out whoever you want for 250 credits.
19668/0:Fire in the hole.
19669/0:Bah!  Biomods...
19669/1:How can you live like that, with your body so corrupted?
19670/0:How can they simultaneously support the ideals of the Order and the commercialism of the WTO?
19671/0:Someone set a trap.
19671/1:Looks like a proximity device.
19672/0:I'm blocked!
19673/0:Bah!  Biomods...
19673/1:How can you live like that, with your body so corrupted?
19674/0:Bah!  Biomods...
19674/1:How can you live like that, with your body so corrupted?
19675/0:You got something against QueeQuegs, too?
19676/0:It won't budge.
19677/0:The target's modified.  How vile.
19677/1:Looks like we're dealing with a real freak here.
19678/0:(grunt)
19679/0:Too dangerous.
19680/0:Thanks.  Next time, pay when you enter.
19681/0:More bellyachin'... (groan)
19681/1:Always stickin' me on the line...
19681/2:Guess rank has its privileges.
19681/3:I TOLD 'em...
19682/0:I like the sound of that.  Let's move out.
19683/0:(yawn)
19683/1:(grrr)
19683/2:(cough)
19683/3:(clears throat)
19683/4:(whistles)  // WTO theme, if/when available
19684/0:Shhh.  Hold that thought.
19684/1:Wait -- I think someone's coming.
19685/0:I was trying to find out what happened to the missing students.
19686/0:You certainly know how to make an entrance.  What's with shooting up the SSC Station like this?
19687/0:It could hardly be worse than Plague 11.
19688/0:Didn't these protests end up shutting down the factory several times?
19689/0:Not just the sound barrier.  She can see us.
19690/0:Well, when I suggested that my people conduct their own search he brushed me off.  This is quite a turnaround.  I hope he's right about you.
19691/0:Finally.  Here's your pay.  Pleasure doing business with you.
19692/0:You and me, Alex.  Come on.
19693/0:Wish I had more cash.  I'd bet more.  [250 credits.]
19694/0:The target's modified.  How vile.
19694/1:Looks like we're dealing with a real freak here.
19695/0:The target's modified.  How vile.
19695/1:Looks like we're dealing with a real freak here.
19696/0:Where...?  It must be a cloak mod.
19697/0:Where...?  It must be a cloak mod.
19698/0:What do you mean?
19699/0:Where...?  It must be a cloak mod.
19700/0:Real cute.
19700/1:Hey.  What's the idea?
19701/0:Now what?  An aggressive-defense mod.  Just great...
19702/0:Keep clear.
19702/1:You ran into me.  // annoyed
19703/0:Lookin' at something?
19703/1:I feel like I'm being cased.
19704/0:Now what?  An aggressive-defense mod.  Just great...
19705/0:Now what?  An aggressive-defense mod.  Just great...
19706/0:Excuse me.  Ahem.  None of that.
19706/1:Hey -- that's not allowed.
19706/2:You know better than that.
19707/0:Hideous!  It's got a skull gun.
19708/0:Area restricted.  Please leave.
19708/1:Sorry.  No access.
19709/0:Hideous!  It's got a skull gun.
19710/0:Put that away.
19710/1:You tryin' to mug me or what?
19711/0:Looks pretty rough down there.  Pity you couldn't afford a couple of my Sunfire missiles to help you out.  For what it's worth, here's a map of the island.  Later, old bean.  Think I'm gonna rag it over to Times Square to see Erin.
19712/0:I think I've been over that way.
19713/0:Hey!  Watch it!
19713/1:You better not do that again.
19714/0:You better listen to me.
19714/1:Hey, that's enough.
19714/2:Smart alec.
19715/0:I don't know what sort of funny business you have in mind, but if that woman dies so do you.  At first you looked like a skilled soldier out there, but now you just look like a maniac.  Get your butt to the SSC station.  Move!
19716/0:Don't give me that look.  Move.
19716/1:Go stare at someone else.
19717/0:Quit playing games.  QueeQueg's?  That flavorless brown slop?  She just ordered a tall Pequachino from ME!
19718/0:You're clumsy or you're pickin' a fight.
19718/1:That hurt!
19719/0:An excellent exchange.
19720/0:Any news?
19721/0:Sorry.  Accidents happen.
19722/0:We'll show them exactly what our "pollution" can do in the field.
19723/0:Hi.  I'm NG Resonance.  Hurry!  Come to my concert near the Pequod's coffeeshop!
19724/0:... lost in Paris... too weak to fight the new breed...
19725/0:
19726/0:Yeah, I wouldn't have to pull so much volume if I had a branch in Lower Seattle.  What's it to you?
19727/0:Damn that school.
19728/0:Oh, the cyborg.  I already took him out.
19729/0:No!
19729/1:That's going too far!
19729/2:Oh, Jesus...  // scared
19729/3:That was my friend, punk.
19730/0:Hideous!  It's got a skull gun.
19731/0:I bet it IS a drill.  Some kind of test...
19732/0:No!
19732/1:That's going too far!
19732/2:Oh, Jesus...  // scared
19732/3:That was my friend, punk.
19733/0:You can't outrun your fate, freak.
19734/0:Don -- have you seen the latest ballistics on Project Xenos?  We finally did it!  Now we've just got to fix that bug in the threat assessment firmware.
19735/0:He's dead!  // to self
19736/0:You can't outrun your fate, freak.
19737/0:He's dead!  // to self
19738/0:You can't outrun your fate, freak.
19739/0:She's dead!  // to self
19740/0:Mechs may not see you now, but pure humans still sure can.
19741/0:She's dead!  // to self
19742/0:I need to calm down.
19743/0:Guard down!
19743/1:Oh God!  This is for real!
19744/0:Mechs may not see you now, but pure humans still sure can.
19745/0:Guard down!
19745/1:Oh God!  This is for real!
19746/0:Mechs may not see you now, but pure humans still sure can.
19747/0:That bastard just wrote his own epitaph.
19748/0:That's right, you arrived and you're still there.  I saw you myself -- the real NG Resonance -- then I took a shot at knocking you off your pedestal.  In real life, you're a spoiled brat.  Did you know that?
19749/0:Wish I could afford the silencer.  [600]
19750/0:You have your orders and I have mine.
19751/0:In the bull's eye today -- Professor Louis Strand.  Tell me, Professor -- your liberal think-tank -- don't even liberals understand that when religious fanatics resort to violence the WTO should respond blow-for-blow?
19752/0:Meanwhile, people on the outside go hungry.
19753/0:Uh-huh.
19754/0:One Pequachino, and there goes all the money I brought for shopping.  Luckily, my friend decided to treat me.
19755/0:Go away.  Take the intruders with you.
19756/0:Little do you realize how vulnerable they will be if I can use JC's power against them.  I can remain hidden long enough for Billie to complete her assignment.  Then it will be your turn to hide.
19757/0:
19757/1:
19757/2:
19757/3:
19758/0:I'll take the prox mines. [600]
19759/0:I think you might be lost.  If you're looking for the coffeeshop, go back the way you came and go to level 107.
19760/0:I don't understand.  I thought Kurczec had Trier in his back pocket.  I knew him on Wall Street before the Collapse.
19761/0:Yes.  JC wants you to meet him at Liberty Island.  It won't be easy leaving New Cairo, though.  The Templars have seized the arcology.
19762/0:My character is not called Dumier, but, well, yes -- he was a freedom fighter in Europe before the Collapse.  He had great ideals and now finds himself beholden to crude realities.
19763/0:That bastard just wrote his own epitaph.
19764/0:That banshee just wrote her own epitaph.
19765/0:That banshee just wrote her own epitaph.
19766/0:He killed him!
19767/0:He killed him!
19768/0:Good work.
19768/1:That's how it's done.
19768/2:It's about time.
19769/0:He killed her!
19770/0:He killed her!
19771/0:Good work.
19771/1:That's how it's done.
19771/2:It's about time.
19772/0:She killed him!
19773/0:Good work.
19773/1:That's how it's done.
19773/2:It's about time.
19774/0:She killed him!
19775/0:A few more like that, and she's finished.
19776/0:So you fly modified humans around the world.  That's a pretty weird assignment.  Any luck?
19777/0:She killed her!
19778/0:A few more like that, and she's finished.
19779/0:A few more like that, and she's finished.
19780/0:A few more like that, and he's finished.
19781/0:Anything I can do to help?
19782/0:That's twenty-three title matches. and look at her hide.  Barely a scratch.
19783/0:Are you the one who designed the Mag Rail?
19784/0:(moan)
19785/0:We are so fortunate that Her Holiness found us before Dumier could invade our spirits with such ruthless and selfish competition. 
19786/0:I'm impressed that you would protect the leader of your adversaries.
19787/0:Inventory depleted.
19788/0:She killed her!
19789/0:Thanks.  Next time, pay when you enter.
19790/0:No!  It can't be!  Get!  GET!
19791/0:A few more like that, and he's finished.
19792/0:No!  It can't be!  Get!  GET!
19793/0:A few more like that, and he's finished.
19794/0:Watch out!  It got a guard!
19795/0:Purity prevails. 
19795/1:Good work.  You've finished it.
19795/2:That was my kill!
19796/0:Admirable display of force.  You were trained well.
19797/0:Huh.  My lucky day.  I see that it pays to have old friends from Tarsus.
19798/0:Watch out!  It got a guard!
19799/0:The mutant got him!
19800/0:Purity prevails. 
19800/1:Good work.  You've finished it.
19800/2:That was my kill!
19801/0:The mutant got him!
19802/0:Purity prevails. 
19802/1:Good work.  You've finished it.
19802/2:That was my kill!
19803/0:You sound sincere.  I will discuss the matter with the captain.
19804/0:The mutant got her!
19805/0:We're taking damage over here.
19805/1:A Templar's been hurt!
19806/0:The Order does not condone violence or the incitement of violence.
19807/0:Good.  Now meet your pilot outside and return to Trier.  We're going to find out if this teleportation device really works.
19808/0:The mutant got her!
19809/0:We're taking damage over here.
19809/1:A Templar's been hurt!
19810/0:That's the way!
19810/1:Nice!
19810/2:Onoe more like that!
19811/0:We're taking damage over here.
19811/1:A Templar's been hurt!
19812/0:
19813/0:Look out.  That monster means business.
19813/1: Make that beast pay for this!
19814/0:Look out.  That monster means business.
19814/1:Make that beast pay for this!
19815/0:You do the bidding of Chairman Dumier, but is your heart in it?  Or are you tempted to share the Aquinas specification with us?  We offer you your humanity, whereas he can give you nothing but secular power.
19816/0:As you wish.
19817/0:Yeah, good for me and good for you, too -- if you come around ready to bet next time I get a shot at the title.
19818/0:Yeah, the infolink.  So what?
19819/0:Look what they did to him.
19820/0:The kidnapped gray -- is he safe and healthy now?
19821/0:Sorry, I don't have that kind of money. [200]
19822/0:Time for you to run along, fanboy.
19823/0:Saman has given us orders, including you.
19824/0:I grew up in Old Chicago, not some cozy enclave.  My parents made it clear I was gonna have to make it on my own.  When I got picked for the covert ops program, I figured what the hell.
19825/0:Also, my Omar contact says they have stuff that goes way beyond biomods.  Luck will not be a factor for me.
19826/0:No way, man.  I think they already got him with a barrel or a crate.
19827/0:Without pain, what use would we have for religion?
19828/0:That's the way!
19828/1:Nice!
19828/2:Onoe more like that!
19829/0:I did what I had to.
19830/0:That's it!  You can take him!
19830/1:Stay on him!
19831/0:Look out.  That monster means business.
19831/1: Make that beast pay for this!
19832/0:That's it!  You can take him!
19832/1:Stay on him!
19833/0:That fiend just hit a Templar.
19833/1: You'll pay for this evil deed.
19834/0:That's it!  You can take her!
19834/1:Stay on her!
19835/0:That's it!  You can take her!
19835/1:Stay on her!
19836/0:That fiend just hit a Templar.
19836/1:You'll pay for this evil deed.
19837/0:You did it!
19837/1:Never knew you could handle yourself in a fight.
19838/0:That fiend just hit a Templar.
19838/1: You'll pay for this evil deed.
19839/0:I think this is a humanitarian crisis but also a political crisis.  WTO enclaves have thrived because the WTO offers oases of stability in an unsafe world.  Will this no longer be a truism post-Chicago?
19840/0:You did it!
19840/1:Never knew you could handle yourself in a fight.
19841/0:Oh my God!  May you rest in peace.
19841/1:Oh no!  You fought and died nobly.
19842/0:If there's a bounty, I guess it's yours.
19843/0:Oh my God!  May you rest in peace.
19843/1:Oh no!  You fought and died nobly.
19844/0:If there's a bounty, I guess it's yours.
19845/0:Oh my God!  May you rest in peace.
19845/1:Oh no!  You fought and died nobly.
19846/0:Thanks.  I will instruct my people in Seattle to cooperate fully with your investigators.
19847/0:He got what he deserved.
19848/0:That beast just killed a Templar.
19849/0:That beast just killed a Templar.
19850/0:That beast just killed a Templar.
19851/0:So you're on the WTO payroll now, huh?
19852/0:Catch my show before it's over!  This may be the last time I'm in New Cairo for a long time!
19853/0:You must've really had it in for this O'Rourke guy.
19854/0:Don't be naive.  Think about everything you've seen and heard.  It will all become clear to you.
19855/0:
19856/0:
19857/0:It was bound to happen.  They could only take so much needling from the Order.
19858/0:You have undone her trap.
19859/0:I love it when you talk dirty.
19860/0:Mr. O'Rourke wishes to be alone now.
19861/0:He got what he deserved.
19862/0:We are locked in a death-struggle with Pequod's.  Only one chain will survive the decade.
19863/0:She got what she deserved.
19864/0:Coward!  Come back here!
19864/1:Running away?!  What?!
19865/0:She got what she deserved.
19866/0:You're hurt!  Pull back!
19866/1:You all right?
19866/2:Get behind something!
19867/0:Coward!  Come back here!
19867/1:Running away?!  What?!
19868/0:First drop me near downtown.
19869/0:You're hurt!  Pull back!
19869/1:You all right?
19869/2:Get behind something!
19870/0:Coward!  Come back here!
19870/1:Running away?!  What?!
19871/0:He's after you!
19872/0:Onward to Purity!
19872/1:Clearly an unworthy foe for a Templar.
19873/0:He's after you!
19874/0:Onward to Purity!
19874/1:Clearly an unworthy foe for a Templar.
19875/0:It probably sounds like a lot of high-minded bullshit to an outsider.  My thoughts exactly when JC started speaking in tongues after the merger.  But the logic is compelling if you give it time.
19876/0:Do you have a street map?  I can mark where they are.
19877/0:She's after you!
19878/0:Onward to Purity!
19878/1:Clearly an unworthy foe for a Templar.
19879/0:She's after you!
19880/0:I told you we'd make quick work of this.
19880/1:By Sidon, we will triumph.
19881/0:Hey!  I can't do this by myself!
19881/1:You're panicking!  // panicky
19881/2:Cool -- I'll take over where you left off.
19881/3:Go!  I'll cover you!
19882/0:I told you we'd make quick work of this.
19882/1:By Sidon, we will triumph.
19883/0:I told you we'd make quick work of this.
19883/1:By Sidon, we will triumph.
19884/0:Can't help ya then.
19885/0:This one's going to be close.
19885/1:The tide will turn.
19886/0:Sure, make it into a snipe hunt... give him a flashlight and a dog whistle and send him into the medina...
19887/0:Right now, the name JC Denton is a synonym for the Collapse.  In the end, though, the period of history he has set in motion will be seen as the second Enlightenment.
19888/0:Thank you.  Thank you again.
19889/0:
19890/0:Perhaps my navigation database is out of date.
19891/0:You'll be safe in the rec area.  GO, Alex.  I don't have time to debrief every one of the trainees.
19892/0:Mike and I... we've worked here for years...  Usually nothing makes it past the turrets.
19893/0:
19894/0:So you're Mr. Kurczec.  I met your partner, Mr. O'Rourke, in Seattle.
19895/0:An end to the battles and silencing is within reach.
19896/0:I wasn't sure about you at first, but you turned out to be a good woman.
19897/0:Must've been some fighting...
19897/1:Jeez, looks like a war zone...
19898/0:Bulletholes.  (weak laugh)  Don't know if I should be getting mixed up in all this.
19899/0:Bulletholes.  (weak laugh)  Don't know if I should be getting mixed up in all this.
19900/0:Not yet.
19901/0:I don't think I know you.
19902/0:Looks like it was scorched by a weapon of some sort.
19903/0:I closed up shop and came in here.  I decided it would be safer.
19904/0:Hey!  I can't do this by myself!
19904/1:You're panicking!  // panicky
19904/2:Cool -- I'll take over where you left off.
19904/3:Go!  I'll cover you!
19905/0:Looks like it was scorched by a weapon of some sort.
19906/0:There's no reasoning with you.  We're going to finish this right now.
19907/0:A bolt.  Better watch my back.
19908/0:What's it gonna be?
19909/0:A bolt.  Better watch my back.
19910/0:This one's going to be close.
19910/1:The tide will turn.
19911/0:And they know to search every building?
19912/0:Is that a throwing knife?  Hm.  Wonder what happened here.
19913/0:This one's going to be close.
19913/1:The tide will turn.
19914/0:Is that a throwing knife?  Hm.  Wonder what happened here.
19915/0:Argh.  It appears we may be evenly matched.
19915/1:We're close.
19916/0:It's not too late!  Just stop right now, and you won't bring that monster back into the world.
19917/0:Weird.  Wonder what upset 'em...
19918/0:Argh.  It appears we may be evenly matched.
19918/1:We're close.
19919/0:Argh.  It appears we may be evenly matched.
19919/1:We're close.
19920/0:I'm doomed...
19920/1:By Sidon, is defeat inevitable here?
19921/0:I'm doomed...
19921/1:By Sidon, is defeat inevitable here?
19922/0:I'm doomed...
19922/1:By Sidon, is defeat inevitable here?
19923/0:I can't believe there isn't a QueeQueg's up here.
19924/0:It doesn't look good for us...
19924/1:We're getting overpowered...
19925/0:One guy said Piezochem was shipping their waste to Lower Seattle.  Heh heh.  It would blend right in.
19926/0:It doesn't look good for us...
19926/1:We're getting overpowered...
19927/0:When the spit starts flyin', a gob's gotta stay tuned in to the coach.  That's what happened.  Bug got scared and quit takin' my commands.
19928/0:Tarsus Academy... I cannot believe it.
19929/0:(static) ...has suffered critical failure... (static)
19930/0:Oh well.
19931/0:
19932/0:Please return when you are no longer short of credits.
19933/0:I am sorry, but I am really busy right now.
19934/0:Excellent work.  I'll relay your report to headquarters.
19935/0:Verify that our counter-nanite, which we intend to deploy worldwide, can disable the Denton biomod system without destroying the host.  I will have the results by the time you arrive.  Your pilot will have to meet you in Flight Bay 23.  My people have important work to do.
19936/0:Don't worry about me.  I didn't just come back from the dead to get killed hours before the big event.  Join us at the Statue.  As MJ-12 used us, we've used you, but the commodification of ability is about to end.
19937/0:This city is lost.  Toxic air and fanatics enforcing martial law.
19938/0:Weird.  Wonder what upset 'em...
19939/0:Somebody must've killed it.
19940/0:How so?
19941/0:What a day.
19942/0:Somebody must've killed it.
19943/0:It's out cold... Weird.
19944/0:(sigh) Too many trials...
19945/0:Quit hangin' around.  Someone's gonna see us.
19946/0:It's out cold... Weird.
19947/0:Poor thing's burning...
19948/0:Only a few steps remain before the new tomorrow.
19949/0:I'm going to establish the first posthuman civilization, and you're my first citizen.  Welcome.
19950/0:Poor thing's burning...
19951/0:Just great.  A dead cat.
19952/0:Someone views us as the new plague.
19953/0:Just great.  A dead cat.
19954/0:Pardon the intrusion, but you look modified.  Am I right?  My cousin used to run a clinic.
19955/0:Just great.  A dead bird.
19956/0:Well, good luck out there.
19957/0:You're starting to seem more like a surveillance tool than a pop-star.
19958/0:WTO is getting nervous after all that's going on in Seattle.
19959/0:He's pinned down in the Inclinator right now, negotiating with the authorities for safe passage out of Seattle.  I want you to infiltrate the facility and learn what you can about this betrayal.  Then perhaps we will be closer to understanding his actions at Tarsus Academy.  Speak with the Her Holiness presence in the chapel if you have any doubts about us.  Your data has been fed into the system.
19960/0:Let's go.
19961/0:Are you in charge here?
19962/0:However ruthless, the Templars will be no match for a WTO and Order alliance.
19963/0:Thank you for listening, friend.
19964/0:
19965/0:I know we just deployed some troops somewhere in Europe.... Germany, I think.  It's possible they're going after another lab like this one.
19966/0:Maybe the Order will finally stay out of our way.
19967/0:Just great.  A dead bird.
19968/0:I would have picked up some slacks and a neck sweater if the Templars hadn't overrun the arcology.
19969/0:Just great.  A dead rat.
19970/0:Just great.  A dead rat.
19971/0:I've got to prepare my troops for departure and debriefing.
19972/0:It sounds like there's some sort of history between you and Chad Dumier.
19973/0:Hm-hm.  This was closed.  // pleased with his acuity
19974/0:Your business is with the Luminon and Dr. Todd.
19975/0:
19975/1:
19976/0:Hm-hm.  This was closed.  // pleased with his acuity
19977/0:Wait here.  I'll be back.
19978/0:I turned up evidence that you've been perpetuating the plague in the medina -- by not allowing a counter-agent to be deployed.
19979/0:Hm-hm.  This was open.  // pleased with his acuity
19980/0:Hm-hm.  This was open.  // pleased with his acuity
19981/0:Tell me what you want me to do.
19982/0:That wasn't on -- I know that much.
19983/0:Yeah, it's great.  I'm a walking tank.
19984/0:Why Miss Sak trusts a scab flyer like Sid, I'll never know.
19985/0:A failed corporation named VersaLife.  The Omar have learned much from the VersaLife laboratories abandoned after the Collapse.  Shall we conduct business?
19986/0:What happened?
19987/0:The leaders.  The ones dragging the rest of the planet into this mess.  And JC Denton's utopia machine, whatever it is.  I'm ready to back you up -- just give me an assignment.
19988/0:It took several days before peace returned to the streets of Seattle, but there were no further disturbances afterward, although some of the tension lingers.
19989/0:Why struggle with breathers when simply drinking this tonic can counter all of the nanites' effects?
19990/0:VIP membership is worth almost any cost for someone in your line of work.  Trust me on this.
19991/0:A whole gang snuck into Upper Seattle today -- and I'm not talking about seekers.
19992/0:It's such a relief.  Now things can get back to normal around here.
19993/0:I hope you enjoy your visit.
19994/0:I can take care of myself from here on out -- promise.
19995/0:Persistent little bugger.
19996/0:One scratch on her, and someone's gonna pay.
19997/0:You owe it to yourself and your family to purchase the only real Plague-11 cure. 
19998/0:You will bring about the dawn of a new era.
19999/0:
20000/0:That wasn't on -- I know that much.
20001/0:Can't afford that biomod. [1000]
20002/0:That wasn't off -- I know that much.
20003/0:That wasn't off -- I know that much.
20004/0:Completely destroyed.... Wow.  Now what?  // to self
20004/1:Uh-oh.  Gettin' a little out of my league...
20005/0:Completely destroyed.... Wow.  Now what?  // to self
20005/1:Uh-oh.  Gettin' a little out of my league...
20006/0:Always the same formula, though.  Noise, beer, attitude.
20007/0:Better not take that outta my pay... Just let me find the thug...
20008/0:Better not take that outta my pay... Just let me find the thug...
20009/0:I'm interested in contacting her.  I was told that I could find her here.
20010/0:Great -- a thief.
20010/1:Hm.  It's gone.
20011/0:
20012/0:Great -- a thief.
20012/1:Hm.  It's gone.
20013/0:Hey!  Ever heard of a trash can?
20013/1:Some fruitcake throwing things...
20014/0:
20015/0:Hello there!  You must be Alex.  I'm Klara Sparks.
20016/0:
20017/0:I'll think about settling his debt, but I don't have the money right now.  [250]
20018/0:The Templars are holding my brother, Paul.  Maybe you'd like to correct your mistake and set him free.
20019/0:My pleasure.
20020/0:We all wake up eventually, as adults, to the handiwork of teachers, parents, civil societies -- to the materials that have been worked into us by so many skilled hands.  We are all part cyborg, biomodified or not.
20021/0:You're trespassing.  Leave.
20022/0:It's bad enough they let street preachers in here.
20023/0:Hi.  I'm NG Resonance.  What would you like to talk about, Alex?
20024/0:They may have stopped Archer, but they cannot stop our quest for Purity.  We must obliterate the Nassif bloodline.  Immediately.
20025/0:Hey!  Ever heard of a trash can?
20025/1:Some fruitcake throwing things...
20026/0:Uh, sorry.  Mr. O'Rourke is busy.
20027/0:Wonder how it got there...
20027/1:How'd THAT get there?  Guess I should look into it.
20028/0:Wonder how it got there...
20028/1:How'd THAT get there?  Guess I should look into it.
20029/0:Wonder why it's acting up...
20030/0:Wonder why it's acting up...
20031/0:That's not supposed to be offline...
20032/0:That's not supposed to be offline...
20033/0:Huh, it's dark.  Wonder what happened...
20034/0:They'll never know what hit 'em.
20035/0:I'm your assassin.  How do you want it -- fast or slow?
20036/0:Huh, it's dark.  Wonder what happened...
20037/0:Did someone just turn on that light?
20038/0:You guys are the pros -- Tarsus grads, I mean.  I'm just tryin' to make a living.
20039/0:Wanna make some money?  You a gambler?
20040/0:If I ever get any real power in this organization, just wait and see.  QueeQueg's will be the only coffeeshop chain still in business.
20041/0:C'mon, man, back off.  Why every time we do a job you gotta schitz an' get us all fired?
20042/0:Take me to the Mako Ballistics facility north of the city.  [500]
20043/0:I don't like being spied on.
20044/0:I wonder if Gob-zilla's still the Champ...
20045/0:
20046/0:Hi, there.
20047/0:Soon, darkness and pollution will threaten humankind no more.
20048/0:Did someone just turn on that light?
20049/0:Uh-oh.  Somebody got in.
20049/1:Thought that door was closed...
20050/0:It's nice when people actually follow regulations.
20051/0:Uh-oh.  Somebody got in.
20051/1:Thought that door was closed...
20052/0:No, no.  Not me.  
20053/0:Hm.  Wonder who shut the door.
20054/0:Hm.  Wonder who shut the door.
20055/0:
20056/0:A break-in!  Oh my god!  They must've used a bomb...
20057/0:A break-in!  Oh my god!  They must've used a bomb...
20058/0:It's on fire!
20059/0:It's on fire!
20060/0:Oh no.  Looks like a fire.  // resigned
20061/0:SSC authorities are not sure whether his death is linked to the recent disappearances of a handful of students.  The investigation continues...
20062/0:Right...
20063/0:I got myself here.  Now you want me to stand around doing nothing?
20064/0:Don't hang around too long or else I'll motivate you myself.
20065/0:I show up, and my manager isn't even here.  With my luck, she's dead and I'll have to wait around for a replacement.
20066/0:Sure, make a run at the Statue.  [2000]
20067/0:All of the trainees in the program are Denton clones?  Even me?
20068/0:They had to put up an energy-shield behind the targets cuz the beam goes through walls.
20069/0:Do you think this is really going to work?  Turning their own tech against them?
20070/0:We don't want to be seen talking together any more than is necessary.
20071/0:Come on.  Take a chance.
20071/1:You're in big trouble.
20072/0:Knocked it out?  I said KILL.  If a gob wants to sleep, the trainer just pumps its hide full of zyme.  Sure I saw 'Zilla.  You think I don't know my business?  Damn...
20073/0:Come on.  Take a chance.
20073/1:You're in big trouble.
20073/2:SSC's no joke.
20073/3:You're no match for me.
20073/4:You're toast.
20073/5:This'll be quick.
20073/6:You're going down, beggar.
20074/0:I'm not backing down!
20074/1:I'm supposed to guard this place.
20075/0:I'm not backing down!
20075/1:I'm supposed to guard this place.
20076/0:We were hoping you would run into Dr. Nassif's uncle here, but it looks like he is one step ahead of us.  Now that the hydroponics are out of commission, why don't you pay him a visit?  His apartment is on the second floor of a building across the square from the Order church.
20077/0:Back off, man!
20078/0:Oh no.  Looks like a fire.  // resigned
20079/0:Back off, man!
20080/0:Blood!
20080/1:Someone's bleeding pretty bad...
20081/0:Back off, lady!
20082/0:Blood!
20082/1:Someone's bleeding pretty bad...
20083/0:Back off, lady!
20084/0:A shadow...
20084/1:Excuse me!  If that's a person, I can see your shadow.
20085/0:We can do this!
20085/1:We'll get the weasel...
20086/0:A shadow...
20086/1:Excuse me!  If that's a person, I can see your shadow.
20087/0:Shed your worldly connections.  Develop your Furqan.  It enables you to distinguish between true and false, bewteen real and fiction, between Order and chaos.  Deep in your hearts, you know the path you seek.  You must relearn to access it by turning your back on this materialistic society.
20088/0:We can do this!
20088/1:We'll get the weasel...
20089/0:What does it matter, as long as I have customers?
20090/0:More rat bait...
20091/0:That's right.  Like Sir Francis Drake.  Like Sir Francis Bacon.  Like Sir.... uh, I can't remember what the other one was.
20092/0:More rat bait...
20093/0:Thank you for the tip.  You're entitled to an informant's bonus, if you're interested.
20094/0:Great, the bot's all dinged up.
20095/0:The Hateful Ones must be stopped.
20096/0:Tell Dumier he's gonna have to look for an assassin somewhere else.
20097/0:Our work has always done more good than harm.  The Collapse would have been far more devastating if Chad and I hadn't served the memory of my mother and of my family's history by rebuilding the Illuminati organization, which was nearly destroyed by MJ-12.
20098/0:Come on, I'll be back-- you know this is home to me, Cindy. 
20099/0:That's what I wanted to hear.  Here's the payoff.  It's all I got.  You want more, bet on Snake-eyes in the World Championship.
20100/0:They're going to regret treating me like they have here.
20101/0:
20102/0:Can't get nothin' from ME.  I'm all washed up.
20103/0:
20104/0:It has been a long wait, but well worth it.
20105/0:Let me think about it.
20106/0:We've got to regroup and figure out how we're going to deal with this new menace.
20107/0:The Order is spiritually rich, but that doesn't buy many private aircraft.  Go to the Greasel Pit bar and let Sid Black know about his jet.  I bet he would agree to fly you to Mako.
20108/0:As long as you follow the rules, there will be no problem.
20109/0:Yeah... I admit it.  I'm a fan.
20110/0:I'd like to get into the penthouse, but I don't have enough credits. [300]
20111/0:Do not betray us, Denton.
20112/0:We've got him.
20113/0:I wouldn't be so quick to trust Luminon Saman.
20114/0:That's just a xenophobic rumor.
20115/0:We've got him.
20116/0:We've got her.
20117/0:We've got her.
20118/0:Damn mutants.
20118/1:Can't you see I've got a weapon?!
20119/0:Great, the bot's all dinged up.
20120/0:I hope Her Holiness is safe...
20121/0:Damn mutants.
20121/1:Can't you see I've got a weapon?!
20122/0:Nah, it's just another part of the city-wide lockdown, along with the curfews, to try to regain control after the riots broke out at Panzerwerks.
20123/0:Thanks.  There's sensors that will reactivate everything on your way out.  You're clear to go on in now.
20124/0:Are you nuts?  A firefight in the arcology?
20125/0:I just got an update from Chief Morgan -- what were you thinking?  We needed that information fast, and now you've ruined our chances. You could've helped the WTO and they could've helped you, but now it's clear that you're only going to jeopardize our objectives.  My new orders are to neutralize you, like any other extremist operative.
20126/0:Good.
20126/1:Say your goodbyes.
20127/0:
20128/0:Good.
20128/1:Say your goodbyes.
20129/0:A body!
20129/1:(gasp)  This is serious!
20129/2:Oh God... a person... What do I do?
20130/0:Silence is coming.
20131/0:Too late for apologies.
20131/1:So long, punk.
20132/0:A body!
20132/1:(gasp)  This is serious!
20132/2:Oh God... a person... What do I do?
20133/0:Too late for apologies.
20133/1:So long, punk.
20134/0:Wow, out cold...
20134/1:Still breathing -- whoever did this can't be far...
20135/0:Wow, out cold...
20135/1:Still breathing -- whoever did this can't be far...
20136/0:Jeez, somebody knocked him out...
20137/0:Well, here's your chance to settle an old score.
20138/0:You're welcome to listen in.  Just don't disturb the worshippers.
20139/0:Jeez, somebody knocked him out...
20140/0:Jeez, somebody knocked her out...
20141/0:Not the same as the captors.  We can sense it.  Can you free us?
20142/0:So after the Collapse JC went underground to....  what?  Start his own biomod firm?  From what I know, he doesn't seem like the corporate type.
20143/0:Information not relevant.
20144/0:Now my boss is looking for someone else to do his dirty work.  Huh.  Corporate terrorism against a coffeeshop.  I'd like to meet the scab that takes THAT job.
20145/0:Yeah?  What kind of equipment do you have?
20146/0:After all the equipment they wrecked and stole in the name of "preserving the natural Order," I do not understand why the WTO would agree to a summit with these freaks.
20147/0:I think this one's in the bag.
20147/1:Let's finish this!
20148/0:... danger... the enemy... very close...
20149/0:I think this one's in the bag.
20149/1:Let's finish this!
20150/0:He looks hurt.
20151/0:I know Saman says you're on our side now, but can I really trust you?
20152/0:The Church suffers from certain internal disputes.  I can explain more later.  Hurry, Alex.  You'll find us in the old Hartford Turbine factory in Lower Seattle.
20153/0:He looks hurt.
20154/0:She looks hurt.
20155/0:Jeez, somebody knocked her out...
20156/0:Warning: Greenhouse atmosphere beyond safe boundaries.  
20157/0:I guess I'm not the only one.  Are you still sitting in your helicopter on the landing pad?
20158/0:She looks hurt.
20159/0:(gasp) A corpse!
20159/1:This -- this is murder!  Oh my God!
20160/0:Yes, we will share with THEM the compassion and peace Her Holiness has shown US.
20161/0:This is what I do with genetic sports.
20161/1:Shouldn't've left your cage...
20162/0:(gasp) A corpse!
20162/1:This -- this is murder!  Oh my God!
20163/0:You're -- you're serious, aren't you?  Someone sent you to kill me?
20164/0:This is what I do with genetic sports.
20164/1:Shouldn't've left your cage...
20165/0:He's dead.  We've got to do something!
20166/0:It's hurt pretty bad.
20167/0:He's dead.  We've got to do something!
20168/0:It's hurt pretty bad.
20169/0:She's dead.  We've got to do something!
20170/0:She's dead.  We've got to do something!
20171/0:Alive!  Good.  Hope I'm not next.
20172/0:Alive!  Good.  Hope I'm not next.
20173/0:A guard!
20173/1:Someone killed a guard...
20174/0:Admirable job at the Gate.  I FIGURED they'd bring in a specialist...
20175/0:I'm sorry about your tragedy.
20176/0:How much did I win?
20177/0:We'll try to overlook your betrayal at the Mako facility if you help us find Dr. Nassif.  She comes from a poor family in this plague-stricken village.  Billie Adams will be coordinating the investigation from the mosque that lies between the arcology and the village.  Report to her at once.
20178/0:Just a glass of sherry... and some conversation... Please don't scare him off.
20179/0:I've decided that you might be going in the right direction.
20180/0:How do you mean?
20181/0:
20181/1:
20181/2:
20182/0:Yeah?
20183/0:Perhaps you want a black-market biomod canister, which enables non-Piezochem functionality.  I'm also selling three gas grenades, which deliver a biotoxin irritant in gaseous form.  I've also got an ammo clip, which provides universal ammunition for all weapons.  You must pay market price for each.
20184/0:(grunt)
20184/1:(grunt)
20184/2:(grunt)
20185/0:(grunt)
20185/1:(grunt)
20185/2:(grunt)
20186/0:If you want to hurt him, you're gonna have to go through me.
20187/0:Stay close!  I'm goin' in!
20187/1:Now!
20187/2:No holdouts!  Let's go!
20188/0:Stay close!  I'm goin' in!
20188/1:Now!
20188/2:No holdouts!  Let's go!
20189/0:He can't stop a coordinated attack.  Let's go!
20190/0:A guard!
20190/1:Someone killed a guard...
20191/0:He can't stop a coordinated attack.  Let's go!
20192/0:Too late.  Let's find the thug who did this.
20193/0:She can't stop a coordinated attack.  Let's go!
20194/0:Too late.  Let's find the thug who did this.
20195/0:I can't take on any more gear right now.  Hold on.
20196/0:She can't stop a coordinated attack.  Let's go!
20197/0:Do you have any idea what might be going on with the missing students?
20198/0:The Inclinator's shut down and this area's closed off, due to a toxic spill.
20199/0:Pull back!
20199/1:This is crazy -- retreat!
20199/2:We're in too close!
20200/0:Pull back!
20200/1:This is crazy -- retreat!
20200/2:We're in too close!
20201/0:I'll take the gas grenades. [600]
20202/0:The next stage draws near.
20203/0:My only regret is that Her Holiness did not survive to share this great day.  It was her willingness to participate in these negotiations that put her life at risk.  All of us involved in the compromise, from both sides of the table, would like to dedicate this effort to her memory.
20204/0:Hey, thanks.
20205/0:Precisely.   We could never lead humanity as one monolithic force, at least not initially.  The Illuminati have always worked in secret, and the WTO and Order are just two of our present facades.
20206/0:You really should get a map.  It's easy to get lost around here.
20207/0:Really -- I can't believe the Mechanics Union -- or whoever it was -- thought they could decide global policy for the rest of us.
20208/0:This is what you were talking about at the Nine Worlds Tavern.
20209/0:No, no... How can I knowingly work for an illegal monopoly?
20210/0:What's the DIFFERENCE?  That's exactly the attitude that opens the door to tyranny in a free state -- remembering only what was said on the last talk show.  What's the value of a free press when attention spans are so short?
20211/0:Spread out!
20211/1:Let's open up another front...
20212/0:JC will now speak with you.  I will be waiting offshore so that I can take you to your next destination.
20213/0:Spread out!
20213/1:Let's open up another front...
20214/0:Surround him!
20214/1:Cut him off.
20215/0:Surround him!
20215/1:Cut him off.
20216/0:Got a problem?  The owner's probably around here somewhere.
20217/0:Surround her!
20217/1:Cut her off.
20218/0:You're about to become the final catalyst for the next evolution of humankind.
20219/0:Surround her!
20219/1:Cut her off.
20220/0:Let's move.  Easy...
20220/1:Let's take some ground.
20220/2:I think we've got it.  Advance.
20220/3:Let's push forward, easy, easy...
20221/0:Do not concern yourself with my safety.
20222/0:Anywhere else you want to go, I'll be right here.  [500 credits.]
20223/0:I'll take the prox mines. [300]
20224/0:Let's move.  Easy...
20224/1:Let's take some ground.
20224/2:I think we've got it.  Advance.
20224/3:Let's push forward, easy, easy...
20225/0:Alex, what are you doing?  The grays are no threat to you -- they are allied with JC.  He approached you in peace and you murdered him.
20226/0:What's up on that scrip', bro?
20226/1:You got balls -- I'll give you that.
20227/0:Beats runnin' with a bunch low-town scabs, I guess.
20228/0:Move along.  I know you have your orders and I have mine.  Now let me do my job.
20229/0:You made it in.  Now start going through her v-mails.  
20230/0:
20231/0:I think you're plotting something else.  This is just a ploy.
20232/0:
20233/0:Uh... Well, I'm not too political.
20234/0:Once the WTO works through its security problems, I think we'll have a world-class business center here.
20235/0:For the time being, we will remain at Code Yellow.  We will notify citizens immediately of any change in this status.
20236/0:If the human body is a sacred book-- then no organization has burnt more scripture than the Templars. 
20237/0:
20238/0:Go or I call the police!
20239/0:I'm not anybody's pet project.
20240/0:What's up on that scrip', girl?
20241/0:Nice...
20242/0:
20243/0:What do you think you're doing?!
20244/0:New Cairo was one of the first WTO enclaves -- an inspiration for other cities wanting to incorporate.  I love singing here because people actually have the time to kick back and enjoy a concert, though lately -- I don't know -- the city seems different.
20245/0:That's right.
20246/0:Any last-minute advice?
20247/0:First let's get you out of here.  I can't offer you much, but I was just repairing this silencer for Leo.  Maybe you could make use of it.
20248/0:
20249/0:A strafing run?
20250/0:(groan)  I can't believe you betrayed us like this.  But maybe it's not too late...
20251/0:One too many strange events lately.
20252/0:That's steep.  Nevermind.
20253/0:I can't wait to see his priceless art collection.
20254/0:I charge almost double compared to QueeQueg's coffee in Lower Seattle.  Why?  Terrorism.  Taxes.  Rent....
20255/0:It's false advertising if the product doesn't exist, right?  I would very much like to see the file they have in the Evidence Room at the SSC Station.  The suit was dismissed, but they won't tell me why.  What I'd pay to know what's really going on...  [200 credits]
20256/0:What business did you have in the school?  You a parent?
20257/0:This is an historic moment that the SSC is proud to be a part of.  To demonstrate our commitment to making this a safe and productive meeting, I am flying to Trier myself to ensure that everything goes according to plan.
20258/0:No!
20258/1:Now it's personal.
20258/2:Oh, Jesus...  // scared
20258/3:You -- You think I'm just gonna stand here while you kill my friend...?  // angry, broken
20259/0:Who tipped you off to begin with?
20260/0:No!
20260/1:Now it's personal.
20260/2:Oh, Jesus...  // scared
20260/3:You -- You think I'm just gonna stand here while you kill my friend...?  // angry, broken
20261/0:He's dead!  // to self
20262/0:I'm ready.
20263/0:He's dead!  // to self
20264/0:She's dead!  // to self
20265/0:She's dead!  // to self
20266/0:Guard down!
20266/1:Be careful, goddammit!
20267/0:Guard down!
20267/1:Be careful, goddammit!
20268/0:He killed him!
20269/0:Hi, Brett.
20270/0:He killed him!
20271/0:That's a pretty fanciful accusation.
20272/0:Blah blah blah -- It sounds great on paper, it gets you through school, but it doesn't work in the REAL world.  You should know the difference between theory and practice, Dr. Finnerman.
20273/0:You could be the police chief.  The Templars would be afraid of YOU.
20274/0:
20275/0:You will be pleased with the selection.
20276/0:You used to live at the cathedral?
20277/0:Perhaps my friend is right.  Perhaps our terminology has become too sophisticated.
20278/0:Of my own money?
20279/0:I've seen the evidence myself.  He's working for those Purity crusaders -- the Templars.  Looks like you got yourself to safety just in time.
20280/0:A conspiracy to disguise tyranny with so-called "free" institutions.  You're on your own, Mr. Dumier.  I'll hire a pilot at the local tavern and handle the Templar compound myself.
20281/0:Exactly.
20282/0:The WTO ignored them as some tiny harmless cult.  Apparently they've got more followers than we expected.
20283/0:Whatever is really going on, I hope it's resolved soon.
20284/0:He killed her!
20285/0:... punished... poor thing... never got his new toy...
20286/0:At least we minimized casualities, in spite of being caught off guard.
20287/0:Go on.
20288/0:(grunt) Slow down, sir!
20289/0:He killed her!
20290/0:(grunt) Slow down, miss!
20291/0:She killed him!
20292/0:I guess business is a little slow because of the terrorist attack down the block.
20293/0:Good idea.  Sneak past the main defenses.  I hope you have a multitool, though.  The Templars probably alarmed all of the entrances.
20294/0:Uh... hello.
20294/1:No -- I don't know what that rash is.
20294/2:I don't shake hands -- germs, you know.
20294/3:This is my life... always going.
20295/0:She killed him!
20296/0:(sigh) ... Children.  It's a tough time to be a parent now.
20297/0:She killed her!
20298/0:Thanks.
20299/0:My compliments.
20299/1:We all do what we have to.
20300/0:She killed her!
20301/0:Your assignment is to engage the paladins.
20302/0:Get away from him!
20303/0:You're crazy!  Taking the Inclinator through that mess... it's suicide!
20304/0:Get away from him!
20305/0:Get away from her!
20306/0:Get away from her!
20307/0:I'm running.
20308/0:Billie and I are from Old Chicago.  We had sector passes to go to the Tarsus school in the New Chicago enclave.  I guess all of that's gone now.  Billie and I -- we always planned to send money home once we got assigned.
20309/0:Oh.  Well.... You never showed up, so I sold them.  Sorry.
20310/0:Survival of the fittest.  That's how the world works.
20311/0:Nonsense.
20312/0:Whoever it is also helped the Templars kidnap Her Holiness during a meeting with the Panzerwerks union.  They are holding her at the Black Gate laboratory.  I'm going to give you the code to a secret entrance, which is in a room on the second floor of the east tower... 2521.  Look for a keypad hidden behind some crates.
20313/0:I'll see what I can do...
20314/0:Tough break about Chicago.  I guess you knew people there.
20315/0:Contact the receptionist if you'd like to schedule a parent-teacher conference.
20316/0:
20317/0:We still don't know where he stashed the mods.  Maybe if you hadn't been so hot to kill him, we could've captured and interrogated him.
20318/0:Good one!
20318/1:Nice!
20318/2:Again!
20319/0:Troopers will be dispatched immediately.
20320/0:Good one!
20320/1:Nice!
20320/2:Again!
20321/0:Salutations.
20321/1:Nice day, isn't it?
20321/2:Tip top! 
20322/0:Ooo!  He felt THAT.
20322/1:Give it to him!
20323/0:Ooo!  He felt THAT.
20323/1:Give it to him!
20324/0:I guess Her Holiness is finally safe now.
20325/0:You better come clean.  If we find out that you profited from the black market, I won't need a warrant to put you on the floor beside your club-hopping VIP.
20326/0:Ooo!  She felt THAT.
20326/1:Give it to her!
20327/0:You... look like one of the test subjects.
20328/0:Ooo!  She felt THAT.
20328/1:Give it to her!
20329/0:Right.  Well, I'll take out whoever you want for 1000 credits.
20330/0:Just tell them you need time to think about it.
20331/0:This is above and beyond -- that's all I have to say.
20331/1:Good work.
20332/0:This is above and beyond -- that's all I have to say.
20332/1:Good work.
20333/0:Lucky you didn't get your head blown off.
20334/0:Lucky you didn't get your head blown off.
20335/0:An excellent customer indeed -- you've depleted my inventory.
20336/0:You'll come around.  Slicks like you always do.
20337/0:
20337/1:
20338/0:This is WTO Security Chief Donna Morgan.   You were told to report to the air terminal.  Very well, but do us a favor.  The Minister of Culture lives in the penthouse here.  We believe he is smuggling equipment and violating WTO import-export regulations.  Search his apartment for a vault containing contraband.
20339/0:I'm just following orders.
20340/0:Welcome to New Cairo.  Remember: a visitation pass is a privilege.  Don't abuse it.
20341/0:Personally, I think it's about time Lower Seattle -- QueeQueg's Coffee, in particular -- got their own taste of terror.
20342/0:Hate to see 'em go like that.  In his day, Claw was the biggest fighter around.
20343/0:I will have to take your biomod materials by force.
20344/0:I don't think you're going to want to go much further, Alex.
20345/0:
20346/0:I told you -- Tarsus is a front.  No one's quite sure what ApostleCorp is after.
20347/0:I think he heard ya.
20348/0:No, we just can't guarantee anyone's safety.  They put me out here until the director of the facility finds someone to clean up the mess.
20349/0:I think he heard ya.
20350/0:I think she heard ya.
20351/0:I think she heard ya.
20352/0:Patience.  Sometimes violence is necessary, but willful aggression brings none of us closer to true Order. 
20353/0:Be careful!
20353/1:You all right?
20353/2:Too dangerous!  Take cover!
20354/0:
20355/0:Be careful!
20355/1:You all right?
20355/2:Too dangerous!  Take cover!
20356/0:Don't worry, he'll pay for that!
20357/0:Tough luck, D.  The Pit appreciates the business, though.
20358/0:Don't worry, he'll pay for that!
20359/0:These stories about Seekers stealing from the factory are just propaganda.
20360/0:We maintain the habitat for him while he struggles to assimilate the Helios entity, the artificial intelligence with which he joined.  The merger gave him great power, but also threatened him with madness.  He sleeps now to heal.
20361/0:Well, I've turned your heart just in time.  Now make sure that JC Denton has been killed, then step into his machine inside the Statue so that the ducts will be primed with your nanite-capsid architecture.  My scientists will do the rest.
20362/0:
20363/0:Don't worry, she'll pay for that!
20364/0:Don't worry, she'll pay for that!
20365/0:Good, the terminal defenses have been disabled.  Now go to the control room to activate the pilot beacon.  I'll be your pilot until I can resume my mission.
20366/0:Templar bigotry is merely a bastard creed -- it has nothing to do with the search for true order.
20367/0:Tough break about Chicago.  I guess you knew people there.
20368/0:Can't afford any of that feeb medicine anyway.
20369/0:I know it's scary, but don't worry, they'll find the terrorists.  And we're very safe here in the arcology.
20370/0:Hey, I can take care of myself.
20371/0:They've set up camp not far from here and prevent us from leaving.  We suspect they are trying to gain entrance to JC's habitat.
20372/0:What was that noise?
20373/0:Why'd you sign up?  Money?
20374/0:
20374/1:
20374/2:
20375/0:Wonder who he was before he became an Omar.
20376/0:What?
20377/0:Hello there.
20377/1:Things are under control.
20377/2:Just keepin' the peace.
20378/0:I'm not kidding about an attack.  I saw a guard die in an explosion.
20379/0:Once again, good work in Seattle.  The WTO is making good use of the data.  Your next objective: destroy the Nassif family's greenhouse in the village.  Exit through the mosque on Level 108, then go west.  The experimental greenhouse, a violation of WTO regulations, should lead us to Dr. Nassif.
20380/0:That bot's not right... NO!!
20380/1:What's wrong with that.....BOT!!!!  OH MY GOD!!!
20381/0:I could use a little more cash so I can get out of this town in style.
20382/0:Like I said, those people are lucky to have jobs.  If they don't like the conditions, then they can work for someone else.
20383/0:
20384/0:All governments have power.  The benefit of giving this power to a synthetic intellect is that human affairs would no longer need to be ruled by generalities.  Helios will have a deep understanding of every person's life and opinions.
20385/0:My mistake.  Sorry.
20386/0:A suspicious helicopter was circling the city.  Fortunately, both the pilot and the aircraft are now in WTO custody.
20387/0:SSC authorities are not sure whether his death is linked to the recent disappearances of a handful of students.  The investigation continues...
20388/0:Really?  Which suite?
20389/0:Exactly.  But I don't think they were involved with Chicago.  They're a worldwide organization, not a band of terrorists.
20390/0:Don't be naive.  Search Nassif's apartment.  Then go to the Order headquarters in the old Hartford Turbine warehouse in Lower Seattle.  It will all become clear to you.
20391/0:That would be a tedious business.  With luck, the rumors out of Germany are true, and soon we'll start a new phase of cleansing.  Purity can be slow to achieve, or, like a revalation, it can crystallize instantly.
20392/0:As promised, I'm passing along what we can find out about Chicago.  Yes, ground zero was very near our facility.  But it seems a little paranoid to think a rival organization would blow up a whole city to disrupt Tarsus recruitment. Our best move is simply to keep this disaster in mind -- to resolve ourselves to remain independent and watch what we say about our operation to others.
20393/0:That bot...  It's comin' for us!!!  
20394/0:You're NOT going to get away with it!
20394/1:Payback time...
20395/0:You've already uploaded the Aquinas specification.  All I need you to do is make sure JC Denton has been neutralized and his machine destroyed.  The world doesn't need a new god.
20396/0:Pretty thick today, isn't it?
20397/0:Is somebody there?  Help!  Help!
20398/0:This scab's goin' down...
20399/0:Now I can breathe a little easier.
20400/0:Tell it to Mr. O'Rourke.
20401/0:Looks like you won't get any more info out of him directly.  Search the place for clues.  Perhaps Dr. Nassif contacted him when she arrived in Cairo.
20402/0:Conspiracy theories appeal only to those who need an easy explanation for their problems.
20403/0:That's what I like to hear....  Oh, but by the way, I'd like to clarify something about our contract.
20404/0:I trust you to do what's best for everyone.
20405/0:But when did you start using it?  Only after years of breathing this air, just like me.  We did not know any better.  Then by the time they started getting the word out, we were already sick.
20406/0:Even though there are still Templars in Cairo, this should give us enough time to disappear.
20407/0:If you're worried about the terrorist attack, don't be.  WTO security did its job.  The Order Church won't try something like that again.
20408/0:I'm not sure where I'm headed yet.  Sit tight.
20409/0:Probably hoping to have his brain scanned into a computer by future technology... a mod-freak's version of eternal life.
20410/0:Of course I'm listening.  Don't be silly.
20411/0:You'll be safe in the WTO enclave.  Whatever you do, don't go down the Inclinator into Lower Seattle.  The Order terrorists are strong there.
20412/0:You cannot help me now.  Please go away.
20413/0:I've known Mike for years....
20414/0:Perhaps it was necessary, perhaps in the end our kind will be saved another way.
20415/0:No sign of trouble so far.
20416/0:I'm not good with people.
20416/1:I have a lot on my mind.
20416/2:Mind your own business, please.
20416/3:Not now... I'm SO CLOSE to being done.
20417/0:You can?
20418/0:Thank you.  The authorities will be informed.
20419/0:I guess Her Holiness and Chairman Dumier think that if they can make peace in Trier, they can make peace anywhere.
20420/0:D for Upper Seattle Darling?
20421/0:It wouldn't be a good idea for you to hang around here forever.
20422/0:I just need one little drop of blood from the tip of your finger.
20423/0:My father's company has a lawsuit pending about the Nassif greenhouse.  Business is business, I guess.
20424/0:Stop playing games.
20424/1:You're not kidding around, are you?
20424/2:Put down the weapon right now.
20425/0:You just haven't ever really STUDIED the Knights Templar.  They have the same basic ideas as the Order Church, but they believe it, they fight for it, and they don't rip off a bunch of other religions.
20426/0:Go.  I mean it.
20426/1:Off-limits.  Don't make me use force.
20427/0:Just keep it up.
20427/1:I've about had it.
20427/2:You deaf or something?
20428/0:Go ahead.  It's your life.
20428/1:Stop!  This minute!
20428/2:Don't say you weren't warned.
20429/0:You had me worried back there.
20429/1:Just settle down.  We've got work to do.
20430/0:Interesting.  Anything else?
20431/0:Not now.
20431/1:Can't talk...
20432/0:Uh-oh.
20432/1:Sorry -- my fault.
20433/0:Hi.
20433/1:Hello.
20434/0:At ease.
20434/1:Officer.
20435/0:Hi.
20435/1:Hello.
20436/0:I don't feel good.
20437/0:They had better get this sorted out soon.
20438/0:Take care of yourself, Alex.  You've been through a lot.
20439/0:Open your eyes to the greed that surrounds us.  The pulsing traffic of numbers that shapes all power relations and makes us all into tools.  Please, friend, join our cause.  Work for Purity.  Defend the pure human being, who must be kept free from enhancement, modification, cyborg integration.
20440/0:Stop looking over my shoulder.  Unless you are one of the secret Evaluators... heh heh
20441/0:Attention residents of Old Cairo.  The particle haze you are experiencing does not pose a health threat.
20442/0:You're investigating this ApostleCorp for patent infringement?
20443/0:Seriously, watch out for the automated turrets.
20444/0:She is so quiet now.
20445/0:My poor Eeva!  I knew that man couldn't be trusted.  Something's happened -- I know it!
20446/0:I'm protection to help them open shop in a scabland medina near New Cairo.  Two thousand per week -- plus mods.
20447/0:Officer.
20447/1:At ease, officer.
20448/0:Over there.
20449/0:Sorry -- no idea.
20450/0:Visual event.
20451/0:Possible threat.  Visual confirmation.
20452/0:Person.  Visual confirmation.
20453/0:I know the Order came here to have a peaceful summit, but they had to know that a riot was possible.
20454/0:Auditory event.
20455/0:Tactile information.
20456/0:Doubt comes easily like a weed.  Faith is something you must cultivate if you ever want to enjoy its fruits.
20457/0:It's not worth it!  Run!
20458/0:(grunt) Enemy present...
20458/1:(grunt) Unexpected assault.
20459/0:Unknown activity.  Analyzing...
20460/0:
20461/0:
20461/1:
20462/0:She is so quiet now.
20463/0:Whatever your security concerns, you can make it with Mako.
20464/0:Tough break about Chicago.  I guess you knew people there.
20465/0:I already got into the main complex -- but thanks for the offer.
20466/0:You aren't gonna leave me here, are you?
20467/0:All work and no play...
20467/1:Just hanging.
20467/2:How's it goin'?
20468/0:It's a war that's coming, a new kind of war...
20469/0:With or without one of us, you mean.  I'm a Knight Templar now.  May Purity prevail!
20470/0:Investigating damaged object.
20471/0:Good to have someone like you on our side.
20472/0:Investigating destroyed object.
20473/0:The safest option would be to consolidate JC's defences around the Statue.
20474/0:You do this, Red, you better make it quick and hide the body.
20475/0:A deception...
20475/1:Tactic recognized.
20476/0:If you must go out, respirators are recommended, especially for the elderly and for children. 
20477/0:Smoke being used for cover...
20478/0:Noise believed to be deliberate.  Possible diversion.
20479/0:Looks like it was more than a standard infusion.  This IS Paul Denton we're talking about.  It appears they designed it as a new breed of nanite, one suitable for the entire human race.
20480/0:Creature disturbance.
20481/0:Activity evident.  Item was closed.
20482/0:
20483/0:Activity evident.  Item was open.
20484/0:Activity evident.  Item was powered off.
20485/0:Make up your mind.
20486/0:Activity evident.  Item was powered on.
20487/0:Activity evident.  Item destroyed.
20488/0:Today marks the one year anniversary of the Refinery Riots, protesting the incorporation of Seattle into the WTO.  Mourners held a candlelight vigil in remembrance of those killed in the chaos.
20489/0:
20490/0:Activity evident.  Item damaged.
20491/0:So, as the leaders of two of the world's most influential and powerful organizations prepare to make history, they will not need to worry about security concerns.
20492/0:I don't have enough for the apartments' master code. [500]
20493/0:Investigating open door.
20494/0:Investigating closed door.
20495/0:Investigating active light source.
20496/0:Damn bot.  
20497/0:Investigating inactive light source.
20498/0:See ya later.
20499/0:Verified: open.  Investigating activity.
20500/0:Verified: closed.  Investigating activity.
20501/0:Verified: on.  Investigating activity.
20502/0:Verified: off.  Investigating activity.
20503/0:My boss is such a complete jerk.  It's just a Pequod's coffeehouse.
20504/0:Investigating fire.
20505/0:Object classification: human body.
20505/1:Investigating body.
20506/0:Primary objectives have been advanced -- at last, welcome progress.
20507/0:Complete your objective.
20508/0:Hi.  I'm NG Resonance.  Welcome, Alex D.  Hey -- you left New Cairo without seeing me perform!
20509/0:You have my word -- this place is as safe as an army barracks.  And about as exciting, too.
20510/0:Mr. O'Rourke is busy.
20511/0:Well...another strange visitor.
20512/0:Very well.  In addition, you will be given one black-market biomod canister.
20513/0:Activity evident.  Item malfunctioning.
20514/0:Activity evident.  Item disabled.
20515/0:Activity evident.  Item location has changed.
20516/0:Activity evident.  Item missing.
20517/0:I don't understand.
20518/0:It does sound a little far-fetched.
20519/0:Activity evident.  Item moved.
20520/0:Activity evident.  Light off.
20521/0:Activity evident.  Light on.
20522/0:Looks like your old friend Billie is a little upset.  Hmmm.  I apologize if I've come between you two in some way.
20523/0:Activity evident.  Door opened.
20524/0:Activity evident.  Door closed.
20525/0:Can't say much more than that.
20526/0:Activity evident.  Door destroyed.
20527/0:Order be praised -- that woman was trying to run us out of town.  Now take care of her security force so that Sid can have his jet back.
20528/0:
20529/0:How'd you end up in there?
20530/0:My work could take us beyond anthropomorphic architectures... if only they would let me collaborate with other engineers.
20531/0:The WTO's supposed to make sure only the right people get into the enclave.  That's the whole point of incorporation.
20532/0:But -- how?  Miss Withers is a leech.  You already bribed her?
20533/0:I feel so helpless standing here, waiting to be gunned down by some fanatic.
20534/0:Cause of death apparent.
20535/0:Residue classification: blood.
20536/0:Why, hello.
20536/1:So much to do...
20536/2:Have we met?
20537/0:Object classification: carcass.
20538/0:Evidence of recent hostility...
20539/0:Stay sharp, kiddo.
20540/0:Anomaly.  Fire.  Cause unknown.
20541/0:Yes, our organization is indeed the ancient order of the Knights Templar.
20542/0:Anomaly.  Smoke.  Cause unknown.
20543/0:Anomaly.  Blood.
20544/0:This dust, it feeds on carbon from human bodies.  We're breathing the ashes of everyone who has died here.
20545/0:Hi.  Bill Green.  Club Vox security manager.
20546/0:Anomaly.  Shadow.
20547/0:You live here?  It's my first time topside.  Where's a good place to go shoppin'?
20548/0:Queequeg's Coffee.  True to the letter means it tastes even better.
20549/0:Anomaly.  Carcass.
20550/0:I got your jet back.  Isn't that good enough?
20551/0:This is WTO Security Chief Donna Morgan.  Your were instructed to report to the air terminal.  Very well.  You can make yourself useful at the Inclinator instead.  That toxic spill needs to be cleaned up before the Inclinator can be reactivated.  No one there seems equal to the task.  The WTO would certainly appreciate it if you could help out.
20552/0:
20553/0:Only the Omar can provide the technology you will need in order to survive.
20554/0:Anomaly.  Body.
20555/0:Anomaly.  Unconscious human.
20556/0:Not exactly.  Who wants to know?
20557/0:Convergence... convergence... peace.
20558/0:Hi, Brett.
20559/0:Help us put the world back together, Alex.
20560/0:Take me back to downtown Trier.
20561/0:
20561/1:
20561/2:
20561/3:
20561/4:
20561/5:
20562/0:Yes, in order to win this war we've had to employ some of the very technologies we intend to destroy.
20563/0:Hey... My girlfriend's on her way over here.  This might look a little funny.  Know what I mean?
20564/0:Thanks again.  I owe you, Alex.
20565/0:What do you mean -- I didn't do anything.
20566/0:
20567/0:Anomaly.  Dead human.
20568/0:They gave you a locker.  Nassif'll give you the code when it's time for target practice.
20569/0:Network disruption verified.  An Omar has lost consciousness.
20569/1:Unconscious Omar identified.
20570/0:Network disruption verified.  An Omar has died.
20570/1:Omar corpse identified.
20571/0:Attempting to verify sensor disturbance...
20571/1:Very unusual.
20571/2:Event filed for further analysis.
20572/0:Recurring anomaly.
20572/1:More data acquired.
20572/2:Sensor activity continues.
20573/0:Logging auditory event.
20573/1:Noises.  Frequency response inconclusive.
20574/0:Logging visual event.
20574/1:Pattern recognition inconclusive.  Repeating visual scan.
20575/0:Renewed sensor activity.
20575/1:Resuming threat assessment.
20575/2:File re-opened.  Logging all sensors.
20576/0:Well done.  Our enemies will become known to us.  Return to the medina for your compensation and to take advantage of the preferred customer discount you have just earned.
20577/0:Negative.  No threat.
20577/1:Aberration resolved.
20577/2:No further events -- area clear.
20578/0:Logging disappearance.
20578/1:Incomplete data.  Pursuit impossible.
20578/2:Intrusion likely.  Resuming basic surveillance.
20579/0:Mr. Kirkpatrick.... Hmmmm.
20580/0:
20581/0:I know a little something about this "plague."  If you go outside, try to breathe through your nose.
20582/0:All new associations of citizens infiltrate the old ones, rather than exposing themselves to the sort of chaos we witnessed in Chicago.
20583/0:We'll meet again in New York.  To send a message to the rest of the world, I plan to restore the Statue of Liberty.
20584/0:Alex, you finally made it in.  After my rescue mission fell apart, I didn't know how long we'd be here.
20585/0:
20586/0:Okay, have it your way.
20587/0:Get in there!  He's going to kill them!
20588/0:Wait -- Do you know what's going on?
20589/0:A person.  Storing identity profile.
20590/0:Logging disappearance.  Assailant added to file.
20591/0:Logging disappearance.  Killer added to file.
20592/0:I already cooked that gob.
20593/0:Logging disappearance.  Larceny suspect added to file.
20594/0:Activity highly probable.
20594/1:Is someone there?  Do not try to evade my sensors.
20594/2:Initiating search.
20595/0:Checking non-visible radiation.
20595/1:Scanning.
20595/2:Is someone here?
20595/3:Leave now or you will displease the Omar.
20596/0:Isolating auditory disturbance.
20596/1:Sound location calculated.
20597/0:No need for a bloodbath.  Let's sneak past.
20598/0:Analyzing visual disturbance...
20598/1:Visual pattern-match.  Probable threat.
20599/0:Hey!
20599/1:Trouble!
20599/2:You!
20599/3:Leave now -- or I will be required to use force.
20600/0:I expect compliance.
20600/1:Pursuing sensor lock.
20600/2:You can not out-think my surveillance heuristics.
20601/0:Don't worry -- you're good for the rest of the day.
20602/0:Thanks for helping me pass the time.
20603/0:
20604/0:Ma'am.
20605/0:Chief Morgan doesn't like to be kept waiting.
20606/0:Just get to the Statue in one piece.  The rest is simple.
20607/0:We're talking about an Omar cyborg.
20608/0:You aren't the one to blame.
20609/0:We were only following Luminon Saman's directives.  We had no idea it would come to this.
20610/0:I have an arcology pass.  I'll let you know if I hear anything.
20611/0:I don't think Mrs. Withers is going to be taking bribes anytime soon.
20612/0:
20613/0:You could become a very powerful man, Alex.  With biomodification technology properly regulated, you would be the forerunner of a new elite.
20614/0:What the--!
20614/1:Danger!  Overload!
20614/2:Aaaaa!
20614/3:Unexpected... Unexpected...
20615/0:I will eliminate the threat.
20615/1:Enemy identified.
20615/2:Switching to combat.
20615/3:Force required.
20616/0:Target reacquired.
20616/1:The enemy persists.
20616/2:Additional force required.
20616/3:I will persevere until the threat is eliminated.
20617/0:Opponent unprepared.
20617/1:Exploiting advantage.
20618/0:Trust me -- Tarsus has a strict policy against voyeuristic behavior by our researchers.  Your living quarters were observed only to insure that our graduates show no behavioral abnormalities after the biomod infusion procedure.
20619/0:Sighting.
20619/1:Locking on target.
20619/2:Selecting impact point.
20619/3:In range.
20619/4:Target exposed.
20620/0:
20620/1:
20620/2:
20620/3:
20620/4:
20621/0:Sending instructions to the bot.
20622/0:Calling a bot.
20623/0:Her Holiness has lost sight of the true path -- 
20624/0:So I get fired, because I won't go along with his plot against Queequeg's.
20625/0:Calling security bot.
20626/0:Thanks for the help.  You just turned the Seattle coffee business on its head.
20627/0:Protect me from who?
20628/0:I can't find a job in the medina and I can't get a work-pass for the arcology.
20629/0:Welcome to the Seattle WTO Air Terminal.
20630/0:Can I help you?
20631/0:You may pass.
20632/0:We don't have time for niceties.  Dr. Todd is waiting for you in the flight bay.  Do as he asks.  As long as you cooperate, my paladins will hold their fire.  I will have additional instructions for you when you reach Liberty Island.
20633/0:The air's not so bad inside the mosque.  You'll start to feel better.  Just get some rest and forget about Tarsus.  It's a very selective program.
20634/0:Sayings like that got me where I am today.  Something to think about, while you are still young enough to change your future.
20635/0:You failed us at the critical time, Alex.  All our efforts to explain our doctrines to you have been wasted.  Do you understand the consequences of your actions?  The Church can be slow to act, but, trust me -- you don't want Her Holiness as an enemy.
20636/0:Hydroponics failure.
20637/0:In time, we will open their eyes.
20638/0:I hope this is the last time I have to worry about Templars.
20639/0:Calling medbot.
20640/0:Calling repair bot.
20641/0:Consequence unintended.
20641/1:Costly error.
20641/2:Mistake.  I am the one responsible.
20642/0:It's already taken care of.  Pequod's image is going to get a facelift.
20643/0:Enemy hiding.
20643/1:Target lost.
20643/2:Evasive maneuver.  Analyzing event.
20643/3:Yes.  The enemy is afraid.
20644/0:Enemy escaping.
20644/1:Possible retreat.
20644/2:I am losing the target.
20645/0:Enemy unskilled.
20645/1:Favorable error.
20645/2:Enemy assault is uncoordinated.
20646/0:Enemy activating biomod.
20646/1:Cybernetic enemy.
20646/2:Valuable technology detected in enemy's tissues.
20647/0:(grunt)
20647/1:(grunt)
20647/2:(grunt) Damage.

20650/1:(grunt)
20650/2:(grunt) Cannot sustain additional damage.
20650/3:(grunt) Systems critical.
20651/0:Tarsus Tracking Report 1351 -- Leo Jankowski.  Last seen in Cairo, among the Omar, before he was neutralized.  Appears to be a simple mercenary, but the Omar will have studied his biomod technology.  Recommend upgrade to Omar threat classification.
20652/0:I think we can take this all the way, Alex.
20653/0:We offer only the finest technologies, even to someone hostile to us in the past.  However, your purchases will be restricted to the highest market prices.
20654/0:What did he do to you?
20655/0:(scream)
20656/0:Why this family?
20657/0:I guess it could come in handy.  I have some unfinished business in Flight Bay 24.
20658/0:
20659/0:Although the summit has been surrounded by chaos and unrest, WTO and Order representatives did finally manage to meet and discuss ways to alleviate the tension between their respective organizations.  WTO Chairman Chad Dumier was proud to make the following announcement:
20660/0:The Pit used to be MY gig, back when the sewer wasn't overrun with gobs.
20661/0:I will wait here for now.  After you find Paul, I will meet you in Flight Bay 23 at the top of the arcology.  Good luck.
20662/0:Toxin.
20662/1:Harmful chemicals.
20663/0:Move along.
20664/0:(screams)
20664/1:Emergency.  Exoskeleton burning.
20665/0:My mom's been kinda down since we got kicked out of our house.  Maybe we can get an apartment now.
20666/0:Eyesight disrupted -- unable to compensate.
20666/1:Sensor failure -- vision.
20667/0:Systems unharmed.
20667/1:Negligible damage.
20668/0:Gotta be mobile to make a living in this trade.
20669/0:Well... I didn't know there was a time limit.
20670/0:Explosive deployed.
20670/1:Grenade thrown.
20671/0:Grenade.  Getting clear...
20671/1:Danger.  Explosive device.
20672/0:Proximity device detected.
20672/1:Grenade is armed.  A trap.
20673/0:With someone like you aiding JC, we are hopeful. 
20674/0:(groan)
20674/1:(groan)
20675/0:(groan) Shut down.
20675/1:(groan) Failure.
20676/0:I can't believe you let someone lead you on like this.  Who was it?  I'll straighten them out for you.
20677/0:Uh!
20677/1:(grunt) (buzz)
20677/2:(grunt) Systems --
20678/0:One question, Chief -- Chicago.  Who programmed the nanite detonator, why didn't we know about it, what is the WTO going to do about it?
20679/0:Why not?
20680/0:I'm sure it means the apocalypse is coming, just like my aunt always warned.
20681/0:You've already uploaded the Aquinas specification.  All I need you to do is make sure JC Denton has been neutralized and his machine destroyed.  The world doesn't need a new god.
20682/0:Enough strategy.  We have our orders.
20683/0:I don't appreciate you stealing that helicopter, but I'm prepared to overlook the incident if you come through for us at Mako Ballistics.  Get inside the main complex.  Expect heavy security around the perimeter, including automated surveillance and armed guards.  Your assignment will be to locate the prototype of the Templar-funded Mag Rail so that my people can upload a schematic.  More later.
20684/0:I'd like your help, but I don't have the money.  [200 credits.]
20685/0:Yeah.  Who's there?
20686/0:I can't do this alone!
20686/1:Help!  Someone's trying to kill me!
20686/2:Back me up!
20686/3:Quick!  I think I'm in the killzone!
20686/4:It's happening!  Some sort of an attack!  Hurry!
20687/0:I can't do this alone!
20687/1:Help!  Someone's trying to kill me!
20687/2:Back me up!
20687/3:Quick!  I think I'm in the killzone!
20687/4:It's happening!  Some sort of an attack!  Hurry!
20688/0:During the Collapse, JC had little choice other than exile.  The merger with the Helios AI was unstable.  He needed a safe place to retire while we developed a more compatible biomod architecture.
20689/0:What do you mean "no comment"?  I saw a man die.
20690/0:On the way.
20690/1:Uh... right.  // skeptical
20690/2:Sure thing.
20690/3:Hope you know what you're doing.
20690/4:I'm there!
20691/0:On the way.
20691/1:Uh... right.  // skeptical
20691/2:Sure thing.
20691/3:Hope you know what you're doing.
20691/4:I'm there!
20692/0:(sigh) Ho-hum.
20692/1:... always hangin' me out to dry.
20692/2:... jerkin' me around...
20692/3:(sigh) Almost time to go home...
20692/4:Maybe if I went back to SCHOOL.
20692/5:Does anybody listen?  No.
20692/6:You're think they'd trust me.
20692/7:Maybe if I just lean a little, I can get some shut-eye.
20692/8:Those new uniforms look ridiculous...
20692/9:Better not be a rerun tonight.
20692/10:Should've said something at the time.  Too late now...
20692/11:Wish I knew what time it was.
20692/12:Mph, something's not sitting right.  Shouldn't have ordered those eggs.
20692/13:If only I'd bought that car.
20692/14:Birthday's coming up.  Another year down.
20692/15:Another year on this job, then back to school.
20692/16:Must've been crazy to take this job.
20692/17:Hate these double shifts.
20692/18:Been here for hours...
20692/19:Should've volunteered for that mod program.
20693/0:(sigh) 
20693/1:Maybe I'll check my messages again.
20693/2:Let's see, is payday tomorrow or next week?
20693/3:(sigh) Almost time to go home...
20693/4:I miss the old uniforms.
20693/5:Stupid dental plan. She needs those.
20693/6:I'll MAKE him care. Idiot.
20693/7:I got 6 years, that's real time.
20693/8:Seniority oughta count for something.
20693/9:I must be naturally athletic.
20693/10:I could really use a vacation...
20693/11:Can't believe they made me cut my hair...
20693/12:Sure, I'll look the part.  Whatever makes 'em happy...
20693/13:I should've joined the union.
20693/14:I guess I'll stick it out until my band makes it big.
20693/15:I could make more working at Pequod's...
20693/16:Bet she'll be surprised I got a job in law enforcement.
20693/17:How dare they accuse me of drinkin' on the job...
20693/18:Pretty crummy benefits considering I'm risking my LIFE...
20694/0:Mr. Kirkpatrick also requests a good-faith payment, to help the operation recover.  [200 credits]
20695/0:... always stickin' me out here...
20696/0:Just checking up on my investment.
20697/0:What's that?
20698/0:Where'd you get the name Claw?  Looks more like DE-clawed to me.
20699/0:
20700/0:Good.  Helios is already configuring the new Acquinas hub.  Now come to the Statue.  I need a direct interface with your biomodifications in order to structure Helios properly.  To be the center of a civilization, an electronic mind must mirror the intelligences of the citizens.  We will be the models.
20701/0:Okay.
20702/0:You could be telling the truth.  Who knows?  Tell me more about your faith.
20703/0:Okay...  I'm Alex.
20704/0:I asked Mr. Dumier how I join something like special ops, and he just shrugged me off.
20705/0:The guard was dead.  I'm sure of it.
20706/0:... always stickin' me out here...
20707/0:Brrr!  Must be called screw the new hire...
20707/1:(sniffles)
20708/0:Brrr!  Must be called screw the new hire.
20708/1:(sniffles)
20709/0:When do I find out what this program is all about?
20710/0:Oughta be a rain bonus.
20710/1:(sniffles)
20711/0:Oughta be a rain bonus.
20711/1:(sniffles)
20712/0:You have stopped her.
20713/0:Like hell he does.  He thinks I'm an old buffoon with no taste.  They all do.  It's the nature of youth and ambition.
20714/0:(sigh)
20714/1:(yawn)
20714/2:(grumble)
20714/3:(cough)
20714/4:(sniff)
20714/5:(clear throat)
20715/0:(sigh)
20715/1:(yawn)
20715/2:(grumble)
20715/3:(cough)
20715/4:(sniff)
20715/5:(clear throat)
20715/6:(humming)
20715/7:(whistling)
20716/0:My girl in the city, Erin, she has a view of Liberty Island.  First she saw some sort of construction project where the Statue used to be.  Sounds like Knights Templar showed up there, too.  Also a flyer friend of mine saw Chairman Dumier and some commandos on the south dock.  I think you're working for the WTO.
20717/0:Yeah... wish it was that simple.
20717/1:Can't hear myself think.
20718/0:Yeah... wish it was that simple.
20718/1:Can't hear myself think.
20719/0:(sigh) Damn strays.
20720/0:Listen:  I don't know exactly what they've all told you, but you're just a pawn.  And reviving an ancient, mad cyborg isn't going to help anyone.
20721/0:I'm doing what I can, Simon.  I'm having a little trouble convincing customs that it's for an "exhibit".  Give me a few more days.
20722/0:Not a theory -- fact.  Fact -- Inclinator traffic is half what it was two years ago.  Fact -- people this side of the Inclinator can't even get Metro passes anymore.  It's a complete WTO takeover, just like I predicted five years ago.
20723/0:I don't know if I'll need to testify.  I talked to the Chairman.  We discussed regime change for New Cairo.
20724/0:Who are you suing?
20725/0:She went in there and threw the switch.  There was an electrical fire.  The guy I was talking to went in to rescue her, but when he got there she was gone.
20726/0:But -- I was wondering -- does the real NG ever see these conversations -- like, watch recordings or anything?
20727/0:Helios and I are one consciousness.  No distinction is possible.
20728/0:One place where anything can happen, as wild as the outlands seen below our wall-sized window.
20729/0:You want to fly me around... because I'm modified?
20730/0:Wonderful.  You're lucky I haven't left yet.
20731/0:JC does not use the word "Advance."  This notion is present in my original programming, as constructed by Tracer Tong in the 2040s.
20732/0:The WTO's supposed to make sure only the right people get into the enclave.  That's the whole point of incorporation.
20733/0:Get lost before we change our minds.
20734/0:They had some greasels in the lab for class and they got loose.  Surprise!  Those things aren't pet hamsters.  Anyway, there's some expensive equipment in there apparently -- some biomod stuff I think -- so they want the situation resolved quickly.
20735/0:(sigh) Damn strays.
20736/0:(sigh) Damn rats.
20737/0:Nothing that happens here leaves this room.  Nothing.
20738/0:(sigh) Damn rats.
20739/0:Gettin' paid to watch the birds.  Could be worse.
20740/0:Gettin' paid to watch the birds.  Could be worse.
20741/0:Great, more pigeons.
20742/0:Great, more pigeons.
20743/0:
20744/0:Maybe this will convince him to become one of my administrators.
20745/0:
20746/0:Speak with the trader.  I am only here to observe.  And protect.
20747/0:Scan complete.  You are only minimally biomodified.  We can help correct this.
20748/0:You've got to rescue Paul and fulfill your destiny.
20749/0:(cough)  (cough)
20750/0:Demons?  Catch ME...?  (maniacal laugh)
20751/0:
20752/0:I know you've joined our cause, but you're still one of them on the inside.  We can shake hands AFTER you've undergone purification.
20753/0:Oh yeah?  I heard something about that.
20754/0:Beats anything I had going on in Lower Seattle.
20755/0:... cages for mutated animals... a lot of locked file cabinets...
20756/0:Sure.
20757/0:People here have pretty extreme views, one way or the other.
20758/0:At least I'm safe at my school... 
20759/0:Your motives are clear.
20760/0:I like the sound of that.  Let's move out.
20761/0:Hey!
20762/0:That was a joke.  I already have his jet -- I don't have any use for a half pound of his flesh.  Did you have some business to discuss?  I need a pilot, but until Sid settles his debt I can't let him handle product for the Omar.
20763/0:Hey!
20764/0:Let me finish my run.
20765/0:Keep your distance.
20765/1:Klutz.
20765/2:Whoops.
20765/3:'Scuse me.
20765/4:Slow down there.
20766/0:Out of order.
20767/0:What for?
20768/0:Your for real, huh...?  Meet me outside after closing.
20769/0:Keep your distance.
20769/1:Klutz.
20769/2:Don't mess up the uniform -- it's the only one I got.
20769/3:You scuffed my shoe!  Jerk.
20769/4:Keep clear -- I'm kinda jumpy today.
20769/5:Watch it -- you're gonna hurt someone.
20770/0:Your advice?
20771/0:An investigation is underway, but it's been difficult.  None of my people made it back alive.
20772/0:Back off, man.
20773/0:Back off, man.
20774/0:Back off, lady.
20775/0:What about them?
20776/0:Back off, lady.
20777/0:Have you SEEN that thing?  It was like the ice was building itself into something.  Maybe I'm starting to lose my mind...
20778/0:I'm busy.
20778/1:Don't you have something better to do?
20778/2:Just security over here... (awkward laugh)
20778/3:You need something?
20778/4:Is something on my face or what?
20778/5:Can I help you out?
20779/0:Queequeg's -- coffee for a new generation.
20780/0:Maybe if they knew that I'm sick, they'd let me in.
20781/0:The WTO is reviewing the Templars' duties and tariffs payments, so they've dispatched me to do a proper audit.  They may put on a show of amicability, but every time I try to actually SEE what's in that hangar, I get the runaround.
20782/0:I believe you have work to do.
20783/0:Let me warn you, friend -- we consider the modified to be less than human.  Observe what your Second Soul of nanites has done to you -- and consider going to a clinic to be Purified.
20784/0:I can't let you do that.  I'll kill you if I have to.
20785/0:Good thing we kept the Templars from getting to her first.
20786/0:Exactly.  The Order and WTO are just as worried as we are.  The post-Collapse balance of power is very fragile right now.
20787/0:You've probably never given an Omar a chance.
20788/0:We want peace.  No more death.
20789/0:
20790/0:I'm busy.
20790/1:Don't you have something better to do?
20790/2:Just security over here... (awkward laugh)
20790/3:(clears throat)  What are you starin' at?
20790/4:You need somthin'?
20790/5:Keep your dirty looks to yourself.
20791/0:
20792/0:Uh... I wouldn't do that.
20792/1:Hey, uh....  What's the idea?
20792/2:Huh...
20792/3:What's that all about?
20792/4:I AM a security guard, you know.
20793/0:Uh... I wouldn't do that.
20793/1:Hey, uh....  What's the idea?
20793/2:Whoa -- what are you doin'?
20793/3:Hey!  I'm not blind, you know.
20793/4:Uh... I'm not supposed to let you do that.
20794/0:Dude, don't make my job difficult.
20795/0:I am ready to make an approach.  Use the pilot beacon near Flight Bay 23 to clear me for a landing.
20796/0:Dude, don't make my job difficult.
20797/0:Miss -- don't make my job difficult.
20798/0:We want to give people more choices and more opportunities to live better lives.  Surely you want to aid us with such an endeavor.
20799/0:Miss -- don't make my job difficult.
20800/0:I'm supposed to turn people way.
20800/1:Sorry.  No access.
20800/2:I don't know what you think you're doing, but this area's off-limits.
20801/0:I'm supposed to turn people way.
20801/1:Sorry.  No access.
20801/2:I don't know what you think you're doing, but this area's off-limits.
20802/0:I don't want any trouble now.
20802/1:Whoa!  I thought you were serious for a second...
20802/2:All right.  Put it away.  // cautious
20803/0:Look after your interests.  The Omar seek reliable customers.
20804/0:They think they own me.  Nobody owns Leo Jankowski.
20805/0:Can't help ya then.
20806/0:What could we possibly want to take from that abominable factory?  We detest what their industry does to the land.
20807/0:You've tampered with your DNA, but I know that wearing this suit won't mean my kids are born with horns and tail.
20808/0:I do not know who the Templars are, but their name was in these documents and video mails.
20809/0:The Championship's always nerve-wracking.  Gotta get my cetasikas back aligned.
20810/0:My buddy Carlos said he got a job to hold up the Metro operator.  I'm startin' to think he was tellin' the truth.
20811/0:You should understand the history of the Aquinas system before considering such an irrevocable action.  Return to the control room, and I will contact you by holocomm.
20812/0:The Order pulls one of their stunts, and what happens to the average Panzerwerks tech?  Lower pay, lower bonus, and NO job security.
20813/0:Today only we're offering a special price.  Would you like to make a purchase?
20814/0:Ah, Alex D.  Nice work in the inclinator there.  The WTO appreciates your work to keep the commerce routes open.  And Chief Morgan has had a lot to say about you.
20815/0:Well... as long as it works.
20816/0:Is that so?  We must be of like minds.  That'll buy me a month or two until the Omar sneak another one into town.  Here, take the money, a token of my appreciation.
20817/0:What do you mean?
20818/0:Bet'chu thought I was gonna rip you off, huh?
20819/0:Another one lost!  We owe these creatures more than this...
20820/0:Pilot beacon activated.
20821/0:It's Panzerwerks that started the rioting.
20822/0:I don't want any trouble now.
20822/1:Whoa!  I thought you were serious for a second...
20822/2:All right.  Put it away.  // cautious
20823/0:May you profit greatly during the Age of Light.
20824/0:Jeez, man!
20825/0:Jeez, man!
20826/0:Huh?
20826/1:Eh?
20826/2:Oh?
20827/0:Jeez, lady!
20828/0:Jeez, lady!
20829/0:Sure.
20830/0:(grunt) Hey!
20830/1:(grunt) Careful!
20831/0:(grunt) Hey!
20831/1:(grunt) Careful!
20832/0:In the bull's eye today -- Professor Louis Strand.  Tell me, Professor -- your liberal think-tank -- don't even liberals understand that when religious fanatics resort to violence the WTO should respond blow-for-blow?
20833/0:Perhaps my friend is right.  Perhaps our terminology has become too sophisticated.
20834/0:That's enough.
20834/1:Uh, that's pretty disrespectful, don't you think?
20835/0:I'll race ya.
20836/0:The Knights Templar make very strict demands on their members.
20837/0:That's enough.
20837/1:Uh, that's pretty disrespectful, don't you think?
20838/0:You tryin' to start something?
20838/1:Hey, watch it!
20838/2:You're in the way.
20838/3:Moron.
20839/0:The Omar do not take such actions lightly.  For this hostile act, all preferred customer privileges are hereby revoked.
20840/0:Afraid so.
20841/0:Our work preparing the way for humanity is never done.
20842/0:I need to sleep.  Please leave me alone.
20843/0:Yeah?
20844/0:Versalife abandoned their base, but JC ensured that we would be safe.  The Hateful Ones have upset this balance.
20845/0:I got trapped when that toxic stuff spilled.  Even worse, I'm the only one with the code for where we keep the repairbot.  They've got to release it so it can repair the nanoformer which will then clean up the spill.
20846/0:We've been directed to let you pass.
20847/0:Do you think Dr. Nassif is still in Cairo?
20848/0:An admirable gesture regarding my brother.  Now help us acquire an Aquinas hub, and maybe we'll be able to trust each other again.
20849/0:That's better.  The Leo Jankowski I met in Seattle doesn't stand around moping about his problems.
20850/0:You aren't alone.
20850/1:I stand by the innocent.
20850/2:Need some help?
20851/0:You aren't alone.
20851/1:I stand by the innocent.
20851/2:Need some help?
20852/0:No problem.  I guess I don't have to ask whether you're still working for the Omar.
20853/0:I didn't know the Omar employed non-cyborgs.
20854/0:The SSC Executive Commander and Chairman Dumier are here.  I never thought I'd meet both of them.
20855/0:Just open the door when you're ready.  The safety-locks will be removed when you pass through the exit.
20856/0:You tryin' to start something?
20856/1:Hey, watch it!
20856/2:You're in the way.
20856/3:Cut it out!  Freak...
20856/4:Show some respect.  Back up.  Two paces away at all times.  Don't make me draw my gun.
20856/5:Do NOT get in my way!
20856/6:Ouch.  Hey!  Was that your idea of a joke?
20857/0:Move along now.  I'm serious.
20857/1:No loitering.
20857/2:What?  What is it?
20857/3:You got a problem?
20857/4:Can't you see I'm busy?
20858/0:Move along now.  I'm serious.
20858/1:No loitering.
20858/2:You need me to help you move along?
20858/3:Stop freakin' starin' at me!
20858/4:You're buggin' me...  Get outta here.
20858/5:About face, soldier.  Mind your own business.
20859/0:Uh...  I have to ask you to stop that.
20859/1:Stop that.
20859/2:You're putting me in a difficult situation.
20859/3:Seriously, I'm going to have to do something if you don't quit.
20859/4:What's the idea?
20859/5:Leave that alone!
20859/6:You trying to be funny?
20860/0:Uh...  I have to ask you to stop that.
20860/1:Stop that.
20860/2:You're putting me in a difficult situation.
20860/3:Seriously, I'm going to have to do something if you don't quit.
20860/4:Think you're cute, huh?  Is that it?
20860/5:You better stop that -- or else!
20860/6:If you think I'm a pushover just because I'm SSC -- well, you got the wrong guy.
20860/7:Don't make me drag your ass down to the station.
20861/0:I'm serious.  You've got to go.
20861/1:No exceptions.  Please leave.
20861/2:Time for you to go.
20862/0:Guess you're cracking out of luck, then.
20863/0:Here.  Take that biomod.
20864/0:I'm serious.  You've got to go.
20864/1:No exceptions.  Please leave.
20864/2:Time for you to go.
20865/0:I guess you're not very political.
20866/0:You aren't kidding, are you?  // nervous
20866/1:What's your beef with me?  I wear this uniform cuz it's my job.
20866/2:Put that away right now.
20867/0:You aren't kidding, are you?  // nervous
20867/1:What's your beef with me?  I wear this uniform cuz it's my job.
20867/2:Put that away right now.
20868/0:Air Terminal, Flight Bay 23.  See ya there.
20869/0:You're scarin' me, man.  Leave me alone.
20870/0:You want everyone to be like the Omar and meld themselves together into one huge AI construct?
20871/0:Oh, Ani!  You're right -- it's a beautiful day!
20872/0:Yeah, he's laying low like Dr. Nassif requested.  Billie seems to be mixed up with the Order Church.
20873/0:Parents are in an uproar over the discovery that Silas Archer was actually a member of the fanatic anti-biomodification group, the Knights Templar.  
20874/0:Yes, it is.  If she is still alive.
20875/0:Thanks.
20876/0:Everything's under control.
20877/0:It is merely another test along the path to true Order.
20878/0:You can feel the electricity!
20879/0:If the Order would just get out of Trier, there would be no more trouble.
20880/0:Stars?
20881/0:They must have commanders, though.  Soon they'll see that their kind won't be tolerated.
20882/0:You might be interested in something I overheard at the Templar recruiting station in the arcology.
20883/0:That'll show the sneaky beggars not to sidestep trade regulations.  Now look around for clues to Dr. Nassif's location.  Perhaps she was aided by her family.
20884/0:We have intel that a terrorist group may be planning a major attack on this facility, so we're relocating two trainees to Seattle.  Please make the necessary preparations. I'll be sending along their dossiers soon.
20885/0:You're scarin' me, man.  Leave me alone.
20886/0:You're scarin' me, lady.  Leave me alone.
20887/0:You're scarin' me, lady.  Leave me alone.
20888/0:(grunt) Not AGAIN!
20888/1:(grunt) Don't do that again.
20889/0:(grunt) Not AGAIN!
20889/1:(grunt) Don't do that again.
20890/0:I never get tired of talking to my fans.
20891/0:I'm just about out of patience.
20891/1:Consider this a warning.
20891/2:Think I'm just some pushover rent-a-cop?  Huh?
20892/0:I'm just about out of patience.
20892/1:Consider this a warning.
20892/2:Think I'm just some pushover rent-a-cop?  Huh?
20893/0:I helped complete the immune-response code.  Your batch of trainees may very well be the answer -- the seed of 22nd-century humanity.
20894/0:As you wish.  I will meet you on the rooftop next to the tavern.
20895/0:You're over the line, man.
20896/0:You're over the line, man.
20897/0:Maybe they are here to complete their orders for the school, any way that they can.
20898/0:Jesus, lady.
20899/0:Find the Aquinas specification, transmit it to my team in Munich, then step into the machine inside the Statue.  My scientists will modify your nanite architecture into a delivery vehicle for our cellular defense mechanism.
20900/0:Gotta have a system, know what I'm sayin'?
20901/0:Yeah?
20902/0:I hope the situation around here doesn't get worse.
20903/0:Finish off the Denton brothers and step into their machine.  My scientists will modify your nanite architecture into a delivery vehicle for our cellular defense mechanism.
20904/0:You felt a spark of curiosity and gave in to impulse.
20905/0:My money's on Green Dragon.
20906/0:I'm supposed to make you like me.  You like it when I argue.
20907/0:Now that you know the WTO isn't what it seems, what are you going to do?  Leave the organization?
20908/0:Pequod's.  Coffee for your kind of world.
20909/0:Jesus, lady.
20910/0:I'm not thirsty right now.
20911/0:Before the Collapse, Helios was the entity that managed the Aquinas Network.
20912/0:
20912/1:
20913/0:This is your last warning.
20913/1:They expect me to use force in a situation like this.
20913/2:You better back down.
20913/3:Last chance!  I mean it!
20913/4:Respect my authority or I'm gonna take action!
20914/0:Well, make up your mind.
20915/0:This is your last warning.
20915/1:They expect me to use force in a situation like this.
20915/2:You better back down.
20915/3:Last chance!  I mean it!
20915/4:Respect my authority or I'm gonna take action!
20916/0:In spite of your poor foresight we're still going to deploy the tech on time.  The Templar forces must be supported by this armor in their initial sweep against the mod-freaks.  But that doesn't mean I won't find the time to stop by and exterminate YOU as soon as we're finished. 
20917/0:You had me worried there.
20917/1:No more kidding around, okay?
20917/2:Don't do that again.
20918/0:You had me worried there.
20918/1:No more kidding around, okay?
20918/2:Don't do that again.
20919/0:I'm getting groomed for my dad's job.  He handles the entire continent of Africa.
20920/0:Hold on!
20920/1:Later!
20920/2:Can't you see I'm busy?!
20921/0:Have the local police clean up the mess.  You'll be fine.
20922/0:
20923/0:Hold on!
20923/1:Later!
20923/2:Can't you see I'm busy?!
20924/0:The WTO will be here shortly to take me into custody.  There's nothing more you can do here.
20925/0:Oh no!  Sorry...
20925/1:That's not what I meant to do...
20925/2:Screwed THAT up.
20925/3:Well, what can I say?  They shouldn't make me responsible for this kind of equipment.
20926/0:Uh-huh...
20927/0:Oh no!  Sorry...
20927/1:That's not what I meant to do...
20927/2:Screwed THAT up.
20927/3:Well, what can I say?  They shouldn't make me responsible for this kind of equipment.
20928/0:It won't open!
20928/1:Why won't this open?
20929/0:It never ends.  First, watching patients succumb to Plague 11, and now the Templars, a virus for both rich and poor.
20930/0:Better clear out.  Pit's about to close.
20931/0:
20932/0:Friend, let's not be too explicit.  Let me say simply that no war is without its battles.
20933/0:If anyone's a glaring target for Templar paladins, it's a biomodified commando like yourself.
20934/0:Is this entire facility for studying us -- the trainees?  Was I under the microscope in Chicago, too?
20935/0:Good idea.
20936/0:
20937/0:I remember a time when these machines were operational.  They were the backbone of pre-Collapse society.
20938/0:I have done that THREE times already.  This is ridiculous.
20939/0:Tell Eddie it's time for the next fight.
20940/0:Huh...
20940/1:(sigh) Wonder if I should check that out.... Mmm.
20940/2:That's strange...
20940/3:Hey...
20940/4:Wait a sec.
20940/5:Did you...
20940/6:Hey, now.
20940/7:Eh?
20941/0:Huh...
20941/1:(sigh) Wonder if I should check that out.... Mmm.
20941/2:That's strange...
20941/3:Huh...
20941/4:Anyone there?
20941/5:I could've sworn...
20941/6:Hello?
20941/7:That was odd...
20942/0:Someone there?
20942/1:This ain't right.
20942/2:... always somethin'...
20942/3:More?
20942/4:That was weird.
20942/5:
20943/0:Hey, anyone?
20943/1:I thought there was...
20943/2:This is gettin' old.
20943/3:Hey, anyone?
20943/4:I wonder if I should care.
20944/0:Tell me if you notice anything strange.
20945/0:Tell me if you notice anything strange.
20946/0:She moves freely toward her goal.
20947/0:That wasn't a shadow...
20947/1:Coulda been a person, I guess.
20948/0:That wasn't a shadow...
20948/1:Coulda been a person, I guess.
20949/0:Thought I heard something...
20949/1:THAT was a strange sound...
20950/0:I knew it!  They got her, too!   Her Holiness be damned!
20951/0:Why Egypt?
20952/0:I don't know how much more I can take.  I just received word that my cousin Eeva was murdered. It probably was a result of Templar plot at the Cairo Tarsus where she was a student.
20953/0:Who'da thought the cooked meat would be Gob-zilla.  Wow, the end of an era.
20954/0:Thanks for taking care of the situation in the lab.
20955/0:Could be fooling the sensors somehow...
20956/0:From here out, it's just cleanin' up.
20957/0:Calm down.  I think we have a far more serious problem.  I don't think it was one of us who took down the containment fields.  I think they did it themselves...  And I think there is someone, or something, out on the ice now.
20958/0:It wouldn't be a good idea for you to hang around here forever.
20959/0:You'll come around.  Slicks like you always do.
20960/0:Good luck.  I'll hold fire as long as I can.
20961/0:Tarsus is falling apart.  We need to get out before it comes crashing down on US.
20962/0:Thought I heard something...
20962/1:THAT was a strange sound...
20963/0:I just want my job back.
20964/0:Better not be another gob on the hunt during my shift...
20965/0:Better not be another gob on the hunt during my shift...
20966/0:Very interesting.  There's also been a very large transfer of money from a bank in Germany.  Please tell me if you find out for certain what's happening in that facility.
20967/0:Ready when you are, Alex.  Look for me on the roof.
20968/0:Another stray attracting greasels...
20969/0:Another stray attracting greasels...
20970/0:Always somethin' riling up the birds...
20971/0:You've seen more of the island than I have.  Where do you think the bots will do the most good?
20972/0:Always somethin' riling up the birds...
20973/0:The Helios AI has the processing power to handle all governmental functions worldwide, legislative, executive, and judicial.  Once every mind has been enhanced and can merge with the AI, attitudes toward major legislation can be processed on a daily or even more frequent basis.
20974/0:More rats every day...
20975/0:Social machinery is no less harmful to the human organism than biomodification, cybernetics, nanite plagues, and the other modern evils rightfully denounced by Luminon Saman.
20976/0:More rats every day...
20977/0:Really?  Which suite?
20978/0:You need a legitimate career in security before someone will give you any real responsibility.
20979/0:Have you met anyone else here besides Nassif?
20980/0:My brave assassin, soon you will get to kill the other Denton brother and destroy his illegal machine, but first we must recover the Aquinas Protocol specification from a computer on the lower level of UNATCO.  Creating our own Aquinas hub would let us regulate the globe like the Grand Masters of the golden age.
20981/0:It's never too soon to talk to your kids about the dangers of black market biomods.
20982/0:Can't blame the old bean for trying.  Thanks for the help.  I'm so bad at introductions.
20983/0:This is a security alert.  We have information on a possible external threat to this campus.  As always, discuss your work with no one outside the company.  Communicate electronically only on the Mako network.  And starting now -- no visitors.  Our automated systems won't care whether it's a suicide bomber or your grandma.  Be safe.  Now let's make a great weapon.
20984/0:I think this is a humanitarian crisis but also a political crisis.  WTO enclaves have thrived because the WTO offers oases of stability in an unsafe world.  Will this no longer be a truism post-Chicago?
20985/0:You're right next to our church, Alex.  Don't forget to come see me.  That landing pad is run by a local smuggler, Sophia Sak.  Looks like they've seized Sid Black's harrier -- probably as payment for phony debts.  It never hurts to have a pilot who owes you a favor.  You could pay the debt or -- better -- eliminate Sak and her henchmen for the good of the whole neighborhood.
20986/0:Alex, you understand that my machine taps into MJ-12's old network.  The right thing to do is make this network available, equally, to everyone on the planet.  I hope you will reconsider your allegiance to the conspirators who rode the last great civilization into the ground.
20987/0:All available security to the main entrance.
20988/0:Dr. Nassif does not want to be found.
20989/0:Hope they haven't sold my ride for scrap yet.
20990/0:Stop!  I need your help!
20990/1:Guess it's all up to me...
20990/2:Don't bail on me!
20990/3:Go!  Get clear!
20991/0:Stop!  I need your help!
20991/1:Guess it's all up to me...
20991/2:Don't bail on me!
20991/3:Go!  Get clear!
20992/0:Like you said, I talk to everyone.  If you learn what goes on there, please inform me.
20993/0:Nuh-uh.  You don't scrip'-n'split on ME.
20993/1:Your killin' days are OVER!
20994/0:Now what?
20994/1:Guess I spoke too soon.
20994/2:Hm.  Can't be a coincidence...
20994/3:Huh.  These incidents are starting to add up.
20995/0:Now what?
20995/1:Guess I spoke too soon.
20995/2:Hm.  Can't be a coincidence...
20995/3:Huh.  These incidents are starting to add up.
20996/0:Can't believe I LOST the scab...
20996/1:Hey, I KNOW this place.  Don't think you can hide.
20997/0:Gah!  Nothing.
20997/1:... wasting my time...
20997/2:Oh well.
20997/3:Could be wrong, I guess.
20997/4:Whatever.  I ain't no detective.
20998/0:I'll take the master code for the apartments. [500]
20999/0:Gah!  Nothing.
20999/1:... wasting my time...
20999/2:Oh well.
20999/3:Could be wrong, I guess.
20999/4:Whatever.  I ain't no detective.
21000/0:I'm a businessman.  I know how to make tough decisions.
21001/0:Nothing.  Why don't we just relax.
21002/0:Nothing.  Why don't we just relax.
21003/0:At least we are safe now.
21004/0:This job's got me seeing things.
21005/0:This job's got me seeing things.
21006/0:This job's got me hearing things.
21007/0:(laugh)  You never know, I guess.
21008/0:Her Holiness and Mr. Dumier are leaders of a secret society called the Illuminati.
21009/0:Nice move.  That was the nanoformer bot, not a threat.  Now the hazard flush system is the only way to clean this up.  You also could just try powering up the system from the Director's office, but then you'd have to brave the cloud to get to the keypad to activate the Inclinator itself.
21010/0:Better late than never, I suppose.  There are several ways to put an end to the Nassif family's illegal food production.  Destroying the filter system will kill the plants or you can destroy them directly.  You could also reprogram the software that automates the greenhouse.
21011/0:I can't afford the energy cells right now. [300]
21012/0:I'm not so sure.  Her Holiness sounded sincere when I spoke with her in Germany.
21013/0:Welcome to the WTO Air Terminal.
21014/0:Alex!  Stop -- I have something to tell you about Chairman Dumier.
21015/0:Real funny.
21016/0:Actually, I already talked to Miss Withers.
21017/0:If this facility is TEMPORARY, what's the meaning of setting up these accounts?  How long are we going to be here, anyway?  Where are we?  I will continue asking until I get an answer.
21018/0:This job's got me hearing things.
21019/0:Now's it's my butt if they don't catch the vandal...
21020/0:Good doing business with you.
21021/0:Now's it's my butt if they don't catch the vandal...
21022/0:Oh well.  Wish I knew somethin' about forensics.
21023/0:We are, but first the clam must give up its pearl.  Good luck, Special Agent Denton.  We will call on you when the time comes.  In case you need a pilot to take you to the compound, the Nine Worlds Tavern is a good place to hire one.
21024/0:Oh well.  Wish I knew somethin' about forensics.
21025/0:Hope they don't come after me.
21026/0:Don't mess around too long, though, or I'll have to pay hangar fees.
21027/0:Hope they don't come after me.
21028/0:Just some practical-joker...
21029/0:Just some practical-joker...
21030/0:I hope the Omar don't go after my family.
21031/0:Could've been put there by anyone, I guess.
21032/0:You're right next to our church, Alex.  Don't forget to come see me.  That landing pad is run by a local smuggler, Sophia Sak.  Looks like they've seized Sid Black's harrier -- probably as payment for phony debts.  It never hurts to have a pilot who owes you a favor.  You could pay the debt or -- better -- eliminate Sak and her henchmen for the good of the whole neighborhood.
21033/0:From Area-51.  My parents always said we were from Palm Springs.  So is JC Denton here?  Is that who you're protecting?
21034/0:
21034/1:
21035/0:No thanks.
21036/0:
21037/0:The New Age cannot be prevented.
21038/0:Maybe the pre-Collapse government was going to crossbreed a couple of soldiers.  So what?  It's not like they'd ever do that to the general population.
21039/0:Guess you have to be modified to see any real action.
21040/0:We are improving our services for biomodified customers.
21041/0:You grew up in hard times, Alex.  Don't let that make you into a cynic.
21042/0:Maybe later.
21043/0:What?  Are you his girlfriend?  Let's see the money.  Hm.  Okay, then.  I guess we can find someone else.
21044/0:Well... I've got things to do.  See ya later.
21045/0:Watch what you say, Alex.  There's no Bill of Rights in the post-Collapse world.
21046/0:It probably seemed important at the time, whose favorite got stocked.  
21047/0:Could've been put there by anyone, I guess.
21048/0:Gotta stop getting sidetracked by vermin and strays...
21049/0:Gotta stop getting sidetracked by vermin and strays...
21050/0:Maybe it was already shut.  Oh well.
21051/0:If anybody screwed up today, it was us.  Security.
21052/0:Maybe it was already shut.  Oh well.
21053/0:Coulda come open by itself, I guess.
21054/0:Understood.  Business is business, right?
21055/0:Coulda come open by itself, I guess.
21056/0:It was probably on before.  I just didn't notice.
21057/0:Let's go.
21058/0:It was probably on before.  I just didn't notice.
21059/0:Maybe it went off by itself.
21060/0:I don't know what they're thinking.  They can't fool the WTO forever.
21061/0:Beats anything I had going on in Lower Seattle.
21062/0:The infusions... they still haven't taken...
21063/0:Of course they are.  Tarsus is the best school in the WTO.  They would not let anything happen to their best recruits.
21064/0:Good work.  The area is clear -- natural balance has been restored.
21065/0:The Knights Templar make very strict demands on their members.
21066/0:I should be getting some choice cuts by tomorrow morning.
21067/0:Welcome to Mako Ballistics.
21068/0:Here you go.  [100 credits.]
21069/0:We hope this will be the last battle.
21070/0:Believe me!  Free yourselves from this propaganda!
21071/0:Maybe it went off by itself.
21072/0:Damn!  Got away...
21072/1:Gone.  Hm, wonder if I should report this.
21072/2:Well, that's what they pay me for -- deterrence.
21073/0:We still need a lead on Nassif, or we won't know where to send you next.  Double-check the biolab for clues.
21074/0:Damn!  Got away...
21074/1:Gone.  Hm, wonder if I should report this.
21074/2:Well, that's what they pay me for -- deterrence.
21075/0:At least I got a good look at him.
21075/1:Ran the guy off...
21076/0:At least I got a good look at him.
21076/1:Ran the guy off...
21077/0:At least I got a good look at her.
21077/1:Ran the lady off...
21078/0:At least I got a good look at her.
21078/1:Ran the lady off...
21079/0:Be ready next time.
21079/1:No luck.  Better start thinking of something to tell the chief.
21079/2:Gave us the slip.
21080/0:Be ready next time.
21080/1:No luck.  Better start thinking of something to tell the chief.
21080/2:Gave us the slip.
21081/0:I hope those security problems were the worst of it.
21082/0:You should've kept your eye on him.
21083/0:It's plain as day if you take two seconds to think about it
21084/0:This is the Minister of Culture's penthouse.  Strange....  this is quite a nice setup for a mere city bureaucrat....  Take a look around and see what you can dig up.
21085/0:Here.  Take Chen's present.
21086/0:In the bull's eye today -- Lin-May Chen, High Augur of the Order Church.  Miss Chen, do you believe one damn thing you've said since you became a spokesperson for the Church?
21087/0:All is lost now.  Everything!
21088/0:test.
21089/0:So it's haunted.  Nothing but death ever came out of that place.
21090/0:I neutralized the Omar population in the medina.  You can relax.
21091/0:It will be a book about rulers, you know.  Great personalities.
21092/0:I think that the whole organization is about to unravel.
21093/0:Please be advised that Plague 11 incidents are up among medina residents.  Leave the arcology at your own discretion.
21094/0:I killed her.
21095/0:It's a deal.  Here's your money. [200]
21096/0:Who tipped you off to begin with?
21097/0:You're a pro, Alex.  You're inside and Mako doesn't know what hit 'em.
21098/0:Biomods are part of the training.  We knew what they'd do to our tissues.
21099/0:What the hell are you doing?!  They're just children!  
21100/0:I've been talking with their High Augur, Lin May Chen. There was some miscommunication about the raid but the main objectives were still accomplished.  They showed us what was really going on behind the scenes and freed us.  I'm grateful, and you should be too.
21101/0:
21102/0:I'm confident that I have nothing to fear from JC Denton.
21103/0:You're in the game, D.  Now get in there and shake your pom-poms for Gob-zilla.  She'll be comin' out the south chute!
21104/0:Perhaps I can be of assistance later.
21105/0:This suit gives me the same kind of skills and I can take it off at the end of the day.
21106/0:You were a good operative, Alex.  I hate to watch you go bad.
21107/0:Amen.
21108/0:Due to recent events, all bots and security personnel have been mobilized.  
21109/0:The WTO favors Pequod's.  That is why they get all of the big contracts and will someday grind us into dust.
21110/0:Am I about to get jumped or something?
21111/0:I'm in trouble!
21111/1:Hurry!
21111/2:I need help!
21111/3:This is totally out of control!  DO something!
21111/4:Firefight!  I'm not kidding!  Get over here!
21112/0:I'm in trouble!
21112/1:Hurry!
21112/2:I need help!
21112/3:This is totally out of control!  DO something!
21112/4:Firefight!  I'm not kidding!  Get over here!
21113/0:Okay... // tentative
21113/1:Guess we're in this together.
21113/2:I'm with ya!
21113/3:Understood.
21113/4:I'm already there.
21114/0:Come to the tavern.  I have more to tell you about JC's condition -- and why you are so important.
21115/0:Chicago.  You made it out.
21116/0:Okay... // tentative
21116/1:Guess we're in this together.
21116/2:I'm with ya!
21116/3:Understood.
21116/4:I'm already there.
21117/0:(sigh) They wonder why we complain...
21117/1:... always on the clock.
21117/2:Huh.  Real smart.
21117/3:I wish I had more target practice...
21117/4:A job's a job...
21117/5:At least I get to wear a cool uniform.
21117/6:Who would have pictured me toting a gun around for a living?
21117/7:Standing watch all day... not my idea of fun.
21117/8:Two more payments and I can bring home that new holocomm...
21117/9:3 years of service and they give me a HALF credit raise...
21117/10:My feet are killing me.
21117/11:I could sure use a hot bath...
21117/12:Maybe I should apply for a desk job?
21118/0:(sigh) They wonder why we complain...
21118/1:... always on the clock.
21118/2:Huh.  Real smart.
21118/3:Don't know how much more of this I can take.
21118/4:Maybe I'll finally get a bonus this time.
21118/5:Maybe I can sneak in a little shut-eye.
21118/6:She'd be impressed if she knew how much I could bench press...
21118/7:They could've done a better job on the uniforms...
21118/8:So what if the WTO turned down my application... I'm proud to be in the SSC!
21118/9:Was that guy staring at my breasts?
21118/10:Nothing like the weight of a gun on my hip.
21118/11:I really should get my own apartment...
21118/12:Just wait 'til there's an emergency.  THEN they'll see what I'm made of.
21118/13:This gun couldn't hit the side of a barn...
21118/14:Pfff!  Someone loaded this clip upside-down...
21119/0:Your brother's dead, and you're next.
21120/0:Protesters claimed that the vote had been somehow fixed and that the results did not reflect the will of the people, particularly those living outside the enclave.
21121/0:Our corporate sponsors do most of the junior-level applications work.  My contribution -- minor as it may be -- was to the chromatin-synthesis module in the core architecture.
21122/0:No one informed me of a cancellation.  I arrived at Flight Bay 23 just fourteen hours ago.
21123/0:(sigh) These poor people...
21124/0:Dissent within the church grows daily.  I'm not the only one questioning Her Holiness.
21125/0:
21126/0:You and me, Alex.  Come on.
21127/0:... always makin' me stand around outside...
21128/0:Onward to Final Purity.
21129/0:... always makin' me stand around outside...
21130/0:He has a secret office in the back where you'll find all the evidence.  The students who've been targetted have gone into hiding.  If you can find them, they'll also be able to corroborate the story.
21131/0:... freezing my ass off!
21131/1:(sniffles)
21132/0:... freezing my ass off!
21132/1:(sniffles)
21133/0:Wish it would quit raining.
21133/1:(sniffles)
21134/0:Hey, back off.
21135/0:Wish it would quit raining.
21135/1:(sniffles)
21136/0:(sigh)
21136/1:(yawn)
21136/2:(grumble)
21136/3:(cough)
21136/4:(sniff)
21136/5:(clear throat)
21136/6:(humming)
21136/7:(humming)
21137/0:(sigh)
21137/1:(yawn)
21137/2:(grumble)
21137/3:(cough)
21137/4:(sniff)
21137/5:(clear throat)
21138/0:Who could've guessed this was where we'd end up when we signed up for Tarsus, eh?
21139/0:NOW what's it squawkin' about?
21139/1:Blastin' that noise everywhere... They must think we're stupid.
21140/0:NOW what's it squawkin' about?
21140/1:Blastin' that noise everywhere... They must think we're stupid.
21141/0:In a manner of speaking.  We won't hand our research over to fanatics -- not without a fight.
21142/0:They were eliminated.  SSC Chief Vera Maxwell stormed the arcology with forces flown in from Germany, but they were surrounded and are now pinned down somewhere inside the structure.
21143/0:Emerald Suites pays a premium bonus for catching crooks.
21144/0:The goals of the Illuminati -- prosperity, relative freedom, social stability -- are not so baleful to humanity as you suppose.
21145/0:I heard that Her Holiness died.  I wonder what will become of the Summit.
21146/0:I'll race ya.
21147/0:Kill him, you fool!
21148/0:Welcome, my friend.
21149/0:It must be a sign of the end times!
21150/0:Hey, kitty.  // bored
21151/0:Hey, kitty.  // bored
21152/0:No thanks.
21153/0:More rats.  // bored
21154/0:More rats.  // bored
21155/0:Someone's been feedin' the birds...
21156/0:Well, look who's back.
21157/0:Nice weather, isn't it?
21157/1:How do you do?
21157/2:TELL me about it.
21157/3:I've got this NG song in my head.  It just won't go away.S
21158/0:Someone's been feedin' the birds...
21159/0:The woman from Seattle -- yes.  Where are you from?  New Cairo?  Why come here?  The air in the medina is polluted.
21160/0:Find the Aquinas specification, upload it to our scientists, then neutralize the Dentons and destroy their machine.  The world doesn't need any new gods.
21161/0:If the Templars are so appalled by body modification, what do they plan to do with fifty thousand magnetic pulse firearms?  Mmmm?
21162/0:Stay close.
21163/0:This will probably cost me my job, but I'm going to do my best to get Her Holiness back.
21164/0:Tarsus Academy... I cannot believe it.
21165/0:To revive JC, you'll have to repair Helios's five processing modules with an infusion of your biomod architecture.  Prepare yourself for the unexpected, Alex.  JC is conscious but trapped in a struggle with the Helios AI.  His memory is so intermingled with the AI that echoes of his former life are embedded in the very construction of this sanctuary.
21166/0:This isn't a scam, is it?
21167/0:The time is coming when you will have to choose sides, Alex.
21168/0:I saw one of your troopers killed.  And now there's this yellow alert...  Do you know what's going on?  
21169/0:He will contact you himself.  I was instructed to say nothing more.
21170/0:We have prepared the way so that you may carry out the plans of the Illuminati.
21171/0:Here you go.  Just be careful -- some of the tenants are a bit more paranoid than others.  Especially 2225.  He's been really tense lately.
21172/0:
21173/0:
21174/0:
21175/0:You sure are a curious young man.
21176/0:I will be ready.  Thank you.
21177/0:You found him.  Good.  I doubt he'll just hand over the keys to his penthouse, though.  Maybe one of the other patrons knows him and can give you a clue.
21178/0:What the hell?
21179/0:What the hell?
21180/0:George wasn't even around to sign for it.  The more you talk about it, the more I think we should look into it.  Someone's probably trying to get around WTO import regulations again.
21181/0:Thank goodness you can count on Standard Security.
21182/0:Ouch!  (grumble)
21182/1:Slow down.
21182/2:Hey! Look where you're walking.
21182/3:Don't mess with me -- I'm having a bad day.
21182/4:Watch it! 
21183/0:Ouch!  (grumble)
21183/1:Slow down.
21183/2:Ouch!
21183/3:Back off.
21184/0:So?
21185/0:Watch where you're going, man.
21186/0:First you'll need a pass to enter the arcology proper.  Take this one. 
21187/0:Watch where you're going, man.
21188/0:Watch where you're going, lady.
21189/0:Watch where you're going, lady.
21190/0:Lovely.  See you at the terminal, mate.  Level 110, Flight Bay 23.  My jet's on a secure landing pad, so you'll have to contact me with the pilot beacon in the northeast corner of the main terminal.
21191/0:We're lucky you came along when you did.
21192/0:You're staring at me.
21192/1:Don't you have something better to do?
21192/2:Is there a problem?  I didn't think so.
21192/3:What do you need?
21192/4:I'm working.
21192/5:Ummm... yeah?
21193/0:You're staring at me.
21193/1:Don't you have something better to do?
21193/2:Is there a problem?  I didn't think so.
21193/3:I don't like it when people stare.
21193/4:I look like the real thing, don't I?  Funny what a uniform can do.
21193/5:No, I don't use steroids.
21194/0:Are you in charge here?
21195/0:Her weapons have been silenced.
21196/0:Perhaps.  I will find out when I get to Trier.
21197/0:Let's talk about you.
21198/0:Hop in.
21199/0:
21200/0:Excellent.  My navigation unit has what it needs.  I can land as soon as you're ready.
21201/0:It's a shameful distraction.  A bunch of potentates wining and dining.  Plus, they bring in their own coffee.
21202/0:Damn it!  I'll stop you myself.
21203/0:Welcome.
21203/1:You have much to be thankful for.
21203/2:There is a reason for everything.
21204/0:Name's Sid Black.  Harrier pilot.  Best flyer you ever laid eyes on.  I heard there might be a war about to happen around here.  Need a lift to safety?
21205/0:Your children could be their next customers, installing illegal and immoral biomods, ruining their bodies at an early age.
21206/0:Murderer not found.
21207/0:Uh... I wouldn't do that.
21207/1:Excuse me.  I'm not supposed to allow that sort of thing.
21207/2:I wouldn't do that...
21207/3:Jeez... the weirdos always show up on my shift...
21207/4:There's an SSC guard standing RIGHT HERE...(under breath) idiot...
21207/5:I'm going to have to deal with this, aren't I?
21208/0:You look modified.
21209/0:Assailant not found.
21210/0:Uh... I wouldn't do that.
21210/1:Excuse me.  I'm not supposed to allow that sort of thing.
21210/2:Uh... that's not somthing you're supposed to be doing.
21210/3:Hey, what are you up to?
21210/4:You don't want to get yourself in trouble now...
21211/0:Intruder not found.
21212/0:Not cool, man.
21213/0:Vitakka... vitakka... vitakka....
21214/0:Thief not found.
21215/0:Not cool, man.
21216/0:JC Denton is already there, in a manner of speaking.  He will be preparing the systems necessary for the Great Advance while we are in Cairo.
21217/0:Threat probability: no foreseable disturbance.
21217/1:Clear.  Downgrading alert.
21218/0:Not cool, lady.
21219/0:Target acquired.
21219/1:Engaging.
21220/0:Not cool, lady.
21221/0:They told me to limit access.
21221/1:You're gonna have to go another way.
21221/2:You aren't allowed to be here -- I have strict orders.
21222/0:They told me to limit access.
21222/1:You're gonna have to go another way.
21222/2:You aren't allowed to be here -- I have strict orders.
21223/0:We sure taught him a lesson.
21224/0:So ApostleCorp has some sort of home base in Cairo.  I think you found your next line of investigation.  But first you must steal those plans for the Mag Rail.
21225/0:Easy.  I'm just doin' my job.
21225/1:Oh, great -- a troublemaker.
21225/2:You don't need your weapon.  Put it away.
21226/0:You don't have any extra pilots?
21227/0:Easy.  I'm just doin' my job.
21227/1:Oh, great -- a troublemaker.
21227/2:You don't need your weapon.  Put it away.
21228/0:You're an impressionable young lady.  Do you have any idea what you just liberated from the ice?  No matter.  The brother, Paul, is in my custody, and such he will stay.
21229/0:
21230/0:
21231/0:
21232/0:The facility's under attack -- by who?
21233/0:You can't just GIVE AWAY intellectual property.
21234/0:Sorry.  Never mind.
21235/0:Destroying lifeform.
21236/0:Target reacquired.
21236/1:Continuing engagement.
21237/0:No weaponry detected.
21238/0:Thanks.  Now SSC will know to send in a rescue team. 
21239/0:Target occluded.
21239/1:Analyzing evasive tactic.
21240/0:I just work the booth.
21241/0:Target retreating.
21241/1:Response effective.
21242/0:
21243/0:Attack evaded.  Continuing operation.
21243/1:Enemy attacks inaccurate.  Degrading threat assessment.
21244/0:It must be pretty risky for the Omar to operate in the heart of Upper Seattle.
21245/0:Damage sustained.
21245/1:Assessing damage.
21246/0:Severe damage.
21246/1:Danger.  Hull integrity failing.
21247/0:Systems failing.
21247/1:Mission jeopardized.
21248/0:Extreme heat.  Compensating.
21249/0:Guess HE forgot his bulletproof bathrobe.
21250/0:We will watch you.
21251/0:You have your orders.  Proceed.
21252/0:Seek a binding principle in all that you do.  That is the only way any of us can escape the ties and tangles of which we are made.
21253/0:The Order is spiritually rich, but that doesn't buy many private jets.  Finish the job at Sophia Sak's landing pad, or go to the Greasel Pit bar.  You shouldn't have any trouble finding a pilot there.
21254/0:Straight at her, Green!  Atta-boy!
21255/0:The grades just came out for the biochem and intuition classes.  Some kids aren't thrilled about it.
21256/0:Hang tight.  I'll be right back.
21257/0:Maybe I can help her get Mr. Black to pay.
21258/0:
21259/0:Sure.
21260/0:What do you mean?
21261/0:
21262/0:Chairman Dumier is watching me very closely.  I'd better stay behind.  Besides, I still believe in the WTO -- just not its leader.
21263/0:Good thinking.  Use the roof for sniping and moving about the area.
21264/0:Come to think of it, you don't look like an enclave type at all.
21265/0:Don't tell me you're one of those paranoid secret-society types.
21266/0:I don't mind taking them down one at a time.
21267/0:That's the main entrance.  You either have to get your hands on the door code or blast your way in with some kind of explosive.
21268/0:Enemy ineffective.
21268/1:Threat assesment: minor.
21269/0:What's the lawyer say the club member did?
21270/0:Targeting accurate.
21270/1:Target damaged.
21271/0:Target eliminated.
21271/1:Successful battle logged for analysis.
21272/0:
21273/0:Targeting.
21273/1:Weapon alignment.
21274/0:Coordinating with additional unit.
21275/0:I'm just looking for some answers.  Tell me about the Mag Rail project and what it has to do with ApostleCorp.
21276/0:Summoning additional units.
21277/0:This won't be the first time I got paid overtime after someone forgot to send me home.
21278/0:Summoning medical bot.
21279/0:The Championship match can get kinda mean.  You don't want to watch if you have a weak stomach.
21280/0:Leave.  You're blowing my cover.
21281/0:Does this have anything to do with that scientist?  The one that came through the biolab and took the chopper?
21282/0:Good work.  The area will be safe for travel shortly.  Now that the area is safe for travel, you may want to report the news to the Inclinator director.
21283/0:
21284/0:This is an impressive campus.  It seems like a great facility -- nothing like the Tarsus I went to at their age.
21285/0:
21286/0:
21287/0:I said tell it to the Chief.
21288/0:
21289/0:What a happy ending.
21290/0:Her Holiness can burn in Hell.  Human Purity used to be her motto.  Now she waters it down for enclave types who don't belong in the Church to begin with.
21291/0:Balance, my friend.  In these times, we need balance.
21292/0:I'm sure the WTO isn't thrilled that you went through the spill either.
21293/0:(clears throat)  Need to clean the filter...
21294/0:Heard you went rogue.
21295/0:Summoning repair bot.
21296/0:If you want to talk to Miss Sak, fine.  But no snooping around.
21297/0:Our research isn't ready for public consumption yet.
21298/0:Unexpected consequence of action.  Reviewing sequence.
21299/0:I'll get by, I guess.
21300/0:Systems need repair.
21301/0:You're asking me to murder an enclave citizen?
21302/0:Subsumption (garble garble) error (garble) systems (squeal) error (bleep) error.
21303/0:I've learned some things about the experiments they were doing on us.
21304/0:Systems powering down.
21304/1:Ceasing operation.
21305/0:Autonomous processing interrupted.
21306/0:Hang on there, honey.
21307/0:Autonomous processing restored.  Scanning for source of disruption.
21308/0:Checking sensors...
21308/1:Processing anomaly...
21308/2:Signal disruption.
21309/0:Result uncertain.
21309/1:Processing...
21309/2:Pursuing additional data.
21309/3:Threat probability: low.
21310/0:Reviewing audio data.
21310/1:Sonic disruption.
21310/2:Sound unidentified.
21311/0:Maybe it was an ordering fluke?  Something at the distributor's?
21312/0:There's something you don't know about the Tarsus experiments.
21313/0:Very well.  In addition, you will be given one black-market biomod canister.
21314/0:Panzerwerks refuses to see the light.
21315/0:Enough.  Go now.
21316/0:Excellent.  My technicians on Ophelia are already configuring the first operational Aquinas Hub in a generation... one which is in orbit and safe from tampering.  Now make sure that both Denton brothers are dead, and destroy their illegal machine.
21317/0:Close-range attack successful.
21317/1:Enemy hurt.
21318/0:Success.
21318/1:Enemy hurt.
21318/2:Excellent.
21318/3:Progress.
21318/4:Action effective.
21319/0:I am studying akkolatt -- the mental factor for inebriation.
21320/0:
21321/0:Done.
21321/1:Situation resolved.
21321/2:The Omar have prevailed.
21321/3:Life signs negligible.
21322/0:Error.
21322/1:Failure.
21322/2:Missed target.
21322/3:Targeting heuristic failed.
21323/0:Interesting.  The Order doesn't usually get tangled up in corporate rivalries.
21324/0:Calculating salvage value.... excellent.
21324/1:A very advanced prototype.... interesting.
21324/2:Superior systems, but inferior tactics.
21325/0:I have analyzed your tactics and predicted your defeat.
21325/1:You will be destroyed.
21325/2:Run or expect to be killed.
21325/3:Scenario duration expected to be short.
21326/0:My attacks will not be limited to your bioelectric systems.
21326/1:My directives permit the use of force.
21326/2:Your systems will have value on the black market.
21326/3:I know how to engage a modified enemy.
21327/0:Order be praised -- you have a strong will after all.  That woman was trying to run us out of town.  Now take care of her security force.
21328/0:Proceeding according to expectation.
21328/1:Situation nearly resolved.
21328/2:Time-series analysis of your mistakes indicates that you will lose.
21328/3:Finishing...
21328/4:Victory indicated.
21329/0:High probability of success.
21329/1:Objective is reasonable.
21329/2:Nothing to indicate a serious threat.
21329/3:An uneven contest.  The enemy is expected to withdraw.
21330/0:Careful tactical analysis will be required.
21330/1:Significant risk expected.
21330/2:Even contest.  Switching tactical priorities.
21330/3:A strong enemy, but my capabilities should suffice...
21331/0:We've got our guards in place and every eventuality planned for.  My troops are ready for anything.
21332/0:Right, like I'm about to sign up with a guy who wants to mod people by force.  If you ask me, I think you're dealing with crazies on all sides.  Knights Templar?  Do they really think they're knights or what?  Illuminati?  Who told you they were in the Illuminati?
21333/0:The commando is going to blow himself up?  Interesting.  Thanks for the tip.
21334/0:Fine.  Go your own way.  But don't think I'm going to ignore a threat to the world I brought back from ashes twenty years ago.  The Collapse was the work of your good brother, JC Denton, remember.  My commandos will be waiting for you on Liberty Island -- and so will I!
21335/0:And I'm sendin' YOU to guard the ramp.  Or I tell Mr. Paladin you got shook an' hid.
21336/0:No thanks.  I'll find another way to get in.
21337/0:You haven't seen the last of ME!
21338/0:How much to keep you quiet?  That's what this is about, right?
21339/0:Resuming analysis of anomalies.
21339/1:Additional data.  Assessing...
21339/2:Reassessing potential threat.
21340/0:Good.  I will make sure that the body is destroyed.  You are timid in action, my seeker, but at least Dr. Nassif will not be talking.  Come.  Hire a pilot at Pequod's coffee shop on Level 107 and help us pick up the trail in Germany.
21341/0:I didn't need any help.
21342/0:Investigating specific threat.
21342/1:Likely intrusion.
21342/2:Pattern-match highly probable.
21343/0:What's the situation right now?
21344/0:Be advised.  Force has been authorised.
21344/1:Encounter probable.
21344/2:Threat probability: medium.
21345/0:Visual inconclusive.
21346/0:Is somebody there?  Help!  Help!
21347/0:Sonic anomaly identified.
21347/1:Investigating sound.
21347/2:Compound waveform -- likely presence of intruder.
21348/0:Warning: restricted area.
21349/0:Threat detected.
21349/1:High alert.
21349/2:Readiness level maximum.
21350/0:I must be too skinny.  I wonder how this thing will handle in a fight.
21351/0:Attention.  Remove yourself immediately.
21351/1:Unauthorized organic.
21352/0:Threat probability: high.
21352/1:You have violated this zone's security provisions.
21353/0:Let's go after the Templar leader, Luminon Saman.
21354/0:Name's David Kurczec.  These are dangerous times.
21355/0:Best job I ever had.
21356/0:Snake-eyes all the way.
21357/0:Cover me when I charge him?  I mean, I can handle it by myself.  It's just that in training, we always had back-up.
21358/0:The greater strength may belong to the enemy.
21358/1:Good tactics may be insufficient against this enemy.
21358/2:Great danger.  Options limited.
21358/3:It is not too late to control the scenario.
21359/0:This is great!  Drop you in town, and me and this girl I know up there -- Cindy, I think -- get to have a holiday.
21360/0:So.  That's it.  Come to my city and insult our religious leaders...
21361/0:That's right... I've been meaning to tell you -- Good work on the interrogation of Dr. Nassif in Cairo.  My scientists just laughed at me when I said ApostleCorp had developed teleportation, but I appreciate the advance warning.  I had my staff procure this extra biomod canister so that you might be a more effective operative.
21362/0:(grunt)
21362/1:(grunt)
21362/2:(grunt)
21363/0:Threat too great.  Assistance requested.
21363/1:Request backup.  Urgent.
21363/2:Need additional Omar to ensure victory.
21364/0:Responding.
21364/1:Mission accepted.
21364/2:Ready to coordinate.
21365/0:(bleeps) Diagnostics passed.
21365/1:(bleeps) Culling bad cells (bleeps).... Done.
21365/2:(bleeps) Checking CAM unit... Done.
21365/3:(bleeps) Fuel cells charged.
21365/4:(bleeps) Proceeding with current directive.
21365/5:(bleeps) Posting status.
21365/6:(bleeps) Communication received.
21365/7:(bleeps) Power glitch... fixed.
21366/0:Guess I'll find my pilot and consider your request.
21367/0:(bleeps)
21367/1:(bleeps)
21367/2:(yawn)
21367/3:(clears throat)
21367/4:(electric buzzing)
21367/5:(sparks crackle)
21367/6:(error bleeps)
21368/0:Excellent.  My technicians on Ophelia are already configuring the first operational Aquinas Hub in a generation... one which is in orbit and safe from tampering.  Now destroy that absurd contraption JC Denton left inside the Statue.  Never can be too careful...
21369/0:I suggest you manage your behavior wisely.
21369/1:None of that activity, please.
21370/0:Be careful... the wiring.
21370/1:Warning: high subcutaneous voltage.
21370/2:All of my equipment is cybernetic and impossible to steal.
21371/0:The bodies of two of the missing students, Jennifer McAllister and Eeva Nassif, have just been discovered in Old Cairo.  In addition, the Headmaster has recently disappeared.
21372/0:Why not?  They're both terrorist acts.
21373/0:You cannot learn anything about my systems from visual analysis.
21373/1:Is there a problem?  Why are you staring?
21373/2:See something unusual?
21374/0:No thanks.
21375/0:Yeah, I dug that up.  I wonder if it'll hurt the Chairman's political career.
21376/0:Now what?
21377/0:I wonder how long the Omar will need the human race.
21378/0:I know the church will withstand this crisis, but it's the cost that worries me.
21379/0:Too late.  They left already.  I guess we can watch the news to hear what they talked about.
21380/0:... some bizarre stuff... not sure what they were doing here...
21381/0:
21382/0:Scenario uncertain.
21382/1:Unknown threat!
21382/2:Surveillance failure.  Taking emergency measures.
21383/0:And they know to search every building?
21384/0:
21385/0:Unseen enemy.
21385/1:Seeking origin of the assault.
21385/2:Warning: threats to operation incur appropriate countermeasures.
21386/0:Analyzing collision...
21386/1:Unexpected collison.  Processing...
21387/0:Phenomenon unfamiliar.  More analysis required.
21387/1:Situation unprecedented.  Significance unclear.
21388/0:Enemy tactic identified.
21388/1:Deception attempt detected.
21389/0:Pathway blocked.
21390/0:Well, hurry up, eh?
21391/0:You must be looking for the weapons lab.  You're on the wrong side of the building.
21392/0:Doorway blocked.
21393/0:Launching grenade.
21394/0:Alert -- grenade.  Alert -- grenade.
21395/0:They don't like me talking to the customers too much.
21396/0:Danger -- explosive device.
21397/0:What are you doing?
21397/1:I am wondering what your intention might be.
21397/2:Behavior heuristic abnormal.   Require reassurance.
21398/0:Restricted area.  Please leave.
21398/1:Go back.  Now.
21398/2:You will respect the privacy of the Omar.
21399/0:That's very generous.  What's the Omar's objective?  Space exploration?  What was that thing in the basement?
21400/0:I will be waiting for you to change your mind.
21401/0:Hostility noted.
21401/1:Force will be answered with force.
21401/2:Assault me and you will learn about polyaniline-augmented reflexes.
21402/0:I will assume that was an accident.
21402/1:Do not make that mistake again.
21403/0:We're pretty sure there are Templars in the apartment upstairs, here to threaten my family.
21404/0:This is your second warning.
21404/1:Please modify your behavior.
21405/0:Interference with my systems will be forcefully resisted.
21405/1:No.  Do not jostle my bioelectric systems.
21405/2:I will not accept unwanted contact.
21406/0:Move along.
21406/1:The Omar are not curiosities.  Stare at something else.
21406/2:We choose the Omar.  Don't pity the individual member.... Please go.
21407/0:Stop doing that.
21407/1:I will not allow that.
21407/2:No.  That is unacceptable behavior.
21408/0:Finish off JC Denton and step into his machine.  My scientists will modify your nanite architecture into a delivery vehicle for our cellular defense mechanism.
21409/0:We'll have more fun if you pretend I'm NG.
21410/0:I am authorized to force you to leave.
21410/1:I am to be obeyed.  Leave.
21410/2:Go.
21411/0:I will defend myself.
21411/1:Kill one of us and nothing changes.  I am just one node.
21411/2:Please withdraw your weapon.
21412/0:Weapon system performace: poor.
21412/1:Targeting error.
21413/0:Termination authorized.
21413/1:Accessing tactical database.
21414/0:I'm thinking it over.
21415/0:Mission completion highly probable.
21415/1:Tactics successful.
21416/0:Biomods detected.
21416/1:Trans-human enemy.  Compensating.
21417/0:Enemy moves at trans-human speed.
21418/0:Uh-huh.
21419/0:(bleep)
21419/1:(static)
21419/2:(pops)
21420/0:The arcology eliminates wasteful consumption of land, energy and time by putting living, working and public spaces within easy reach of each other, making walking the main form of transportation.
21421/0:Attention: your survival probability is low.  You are advised to leave.
21421/1:Tactical advantage assured.
21422/0:Difficult combat scenario.  Analyzing...
21422/1:Be advised: opponents in your position who do not flee survive less than fifty percent of their engagements.
21423/0:Don't get my best pilot into any trouble.
21424/0:Thanks.
21425/0:I like your music.
21426/0:It is known that the city is suffering from some sort of disintegrative explosion... nanotech is suspected.  An excessively high mortality rate is expected.  No known organization has yet taken responsibility for the attack.
21427/0:Oh yeah, then why don't you drink one?
21428/0:Politicians existed only because determining the will of the people was a tedious and time-consuming process.  One vote every couple of years was the most input any government asked of its people.
21429/0:I wish MY uncle owned a publishing company.
21430/0:They wanted me to infiltrate the flight bay and murder Paul Denton.  Can you believe it?  Me?  An assassin?  And I almost did it, too!
21431/0:Action interpreted as deliberate.
21432/0:This is your third warning.
21433/0:Very well.  Use the Englishman this time, but in the future remember that I am at your service.
21434/0:Final warning.
21435/0:
21436/0:I have put my systems on alert regarding you.
21436/1:The expectations of the Omar are reasonable.  Please obey.
21437/0:Situation precludes conversation.
21437/1:Danger -- please wait.
21438/0:Greetings.
21439/0:Greetings.
21440/0:I need some firepower.  Give me the SMG.  [400]
21441/0:No problem.
21442/0:Now for the big time....
21443/0:That way.
21443/1:I believe that someone is over there.
21444/0:You got something against QueeQuegs, too?
21445/0:No information available.
21445/1:I am unable to be helpful.
21446/0:(gasp)
21447/0:Nah, I guess I'll just have to wait for her here, since this is the last place we were all together.  If you see her though, please tell her to meet us here.
21448/0:People are DYING in there.  Let me do my job.
21449/0:Combat situation poor.  Recalculating.
21449/1:Warning: destruction of security platforms is a serious crime.
21449/2:Enemy survival probability high.
21450/0:But the tasks grow in strangeness and complexity.  The demands of others corrupt you.  All because you allow yourself to be something other than human.
21451/0:Shutdown.
21451/1:Critical damage.
21452/0:A paycheck is a paycheck.  I don't care who I'm working for.
21453/0:Combat support required.
21454/0:Mission accepted.
21454/1:Executing.
21455/0:Scanning.
21455/1:Threat probability: negligible.
21455/2:Analyzing... acceptable.
21456/0:(bleeps)
21456/1:(hums)
21456/2:(signal noise)
21457/0:Analyzing... unnacceptable.  Please police your own behavior.
21458/0:Stay back.
21458/1:Unauthorized contact.
21459/0:Please peacefully pursue your business.
21459/1:Loitering infraction recorded.
21460/0:
21461/0:
21462/0:Yes.  We will be able to reconfigure JC Denton's contraption to end the plague of biomodification once and for all.
21463/0:
21464/0:You turned out to have some guts after all.
21465/0:Wait.  I believe someone may be listening.
21465/1:Stop.  Postpone this discussion until we can be confident about our privacy.
21466/0:The WTO will get everything back under control, though.  Just give us time.
21467/0:Drone.  Proceed.
21467/1:Sending instructions to the drone.
21468/0:Are you sure he was going to murder the children?
21469/0:Decide where you stand, Alex.  It won't be long before you have to choose.
21470/0:Unable to open the door.
21470/1:This door will not open.
21471/0:Direction blocked.
21471/1:Unable to proceed.
21472/0:It's just hard to keep quiet after an experience like that!
21473/0:Applying force.
21474/0:Hazard too great.  Unable to proceed.
21475/0:Can't blame the old bean for trying.  Thanks for the help.  I'm so bad at introductions.
21476/0:Business in a WTO area involves a much brainier class of felon.
21477/0:The price on those prox mines is too steep for me. [300]
21478/0:Sorry your greasel didn't win.
21479/0:Yeah?
21480/0:Swarm deployed.
21480/1:Releasing bots.
21481/0:A lot like life, isn't it?  Only one gambler comes out on top.
21482/0:I wasn't sure about you at first, but you turned out to be a good man.
21483/0:Systems need repair.
21484/0:Subsumption (garble garble) error (garble) systems (squeal) error (bleep) error.
21485/0:Ceasing operation.
21486/0:Most of us are a little uneasy about the Templars.  I guess a company the size of Mako doesn't have much of a conscience.
21487/0:I was the one who convinced her it was time for a summit.  Ultimately, I'm to blame.
21488/0:Your assignment is to engage the paladins.
21489/0:Be there for us, Alex.  The critical time is approaching.
21490/0:This better be good.
21491/0:I found Her Holiness.  Turns out she was Nicolette DuClare -- an Illuminatus.
21492/0:
21493/0:People lash out when their struggles overwhelm them.  I am not angry at those who have libelled and slandered my office.  I feel compassion for the pain they must feel -- that we all feel -- in dealing with Plague-11.  But we must stand together and not let the tragedy divide us in our times of need.
21494/0:The WTO is fighting an invisible war against several formidable enemies.  Give us your loyalty, Alex.  We need it.
21495/0:
21496/0:You see so many faces, you get to where you can read people's minds.
21497/0:It was engine trouble that brought me down, but of course it's my word against theirs.
21498/0:You kinda snuck up on us.  I guess I'm a little jumpy from all the attacks.
21499/0:Autonomous processing interrupted.
21500/0:The Templars are holding my brother, Paul.  Maybe you'd like to correct your mistake and set him free.
21501/0:Autonomous processing restored.  Scanning for source of disruption.
21502/0:Processing anomaly...
21502/1:Signal disruption.
21503/0:Situation uncertain.
21503/1:Pursuing additional information.
21504/0:Reviewing audio data.
21504/1:Noise detected.
21505/0:Additional data.  Assessing...
21505/1:Reassessing potential threat.
21506/0:Investigating specific threat.
21506/1:Likely organic.
21507/0:Be advised.  Force has been authorised.
21507/1:Hostile encounter considered likely.
21508/0:Thank you.  I will be assuming command of this facility.
21509/0:Visual inconclusive.
21510/0:I'm not expecting any visitors.  Get lost before I call SSC or take care of you myself.
21511/0:See, we all think we're independent and make up our own minds, but we're really just a mishmash of everything that gets thrown at us.
21512/0:Well, I hope I didn't steal your thunder.  When you get to the encampment, you'll probably come across his dead body.
21513/0:What do you know about JC?
21514/0:You've been treated fairly.  In the post-Collapse world, every stable organization is a secret society.  To be visible is to be a target.  Don't blame ApostleCorp for a system we didn't create.
21515/0:For those early mornings...  For those late nights...  For those cozy afternoons...  For an emergency...  Pequod's Coffee.  Morning, noon, and night, it tastes just right.
21516/0:Your little blips of thought -- "bullets," indeed.  You and your kind have murdered the human intellect with momentary impulses, the noise of the machine, seeping into every mind...
21517/0:I don't know anything else about it.
21518/0:The Pequod's manager in the arcology made exactly that mistake of being too political -- aligned himself with the WTO.  Now he is dead, from what I hear.
21519/0:For instance, what if this new members-only club -- the Knights Templar -- what if they are a fiction?  What if Chairman Dumier and one of his old drinking buddies concocted the idea as a way to distract people?
21520/0:Campus-wide policy remains in effect -- no visitors.
21521/0:
21522/0:What's the problem?
21523/0:Whatever is really going on, I hope it's resolved soon.
21524/0:You sure are a curious young man.
21525/0:Sure, tell me about the guards.  I have a map of the area and you can show me.
21526/0:Investigating sound.
21526/1:Compound waveform -- likely presence of intruder.
21527/0:Warning: restricted area.
21528/0:The Seattle Tarsus Intermediate facility was raided, with numerous casualties.  The extent of the damage is not yet known.
21529/0:JC will stop these Hateful Ones, make us safe once more.
21530/0:Closing in.
21531/0:I'll take the frag mod. [1000]
21532/0:I have too many good things happening for me at QueeQueg's to chain myself to some political movement.  My only enemy is Pequod's, and our battlefield is the customer.
21533/0:Ha-hah!  Snake-eyes BURIED that bug-eyed primadonna!  And it was a clean fight, too!
21534/0:What's happening?  I've heard strange stories about Her Holiness.
21535/0:Surveillance failure.  Taking emergency measures.
21535/1:Unexpected detection.
21536/0:The terrorists seem to belong to the Order -- religious fanatics.  Their exact objective is unclear.  All trainees will evacuate the facility immediately.  Use the elevator in my office.
21537/0:Enemy location unknown.
21537/1:Seeking origin of the assault.
21538/0:The nanite cloud developed so gradually that we got used to it.  We got used to people dying, too.
21539/0:Unexpected collison.  Processing...
21540/0:Phenomenon unfamiliar.  More analysis required.
21541/0:Enemy tactic identified.
21542/0:Get MOVIN', feeb.
21543/0:The Omar do not take such actions lightly.  Had you aided us in the past, all alliances would now be nullified, but no such connection exists.
21544/0:Impossible.  NG grew up poor like the rest of us.  She won't put her name behind some fake corporate concoction like the Pequachino.
21545/0:We can bring the world out of the post-Collapse dark age.
21546/0:Everyone, as far as I can tell.
21547/0:With biomods?
21548/0:Let's stay friends.
21549/0:Thanks.
21550/0:Here, take this biomod canister.  It may turn the tide in your favor.
21551/0:I wish I'd been born in the Middle Ages.  It was possible to be a hero then, someone with a name, a quest, a coat of arms... 
21552/0:We humans are the ones who have declared war against THEM.
21553/0:Noise deliberate.  Disregarding.
21554/0:Handle it?  Sid Black invented the TERM "hostile insertion."  I'll meet you outside the tavern.
21555/0:Here you are -- you and Klara both -- our biggest secrets walking straight into a deployment of Templars.  Surely you've guessed -- You're the next generation of the technology MJ-12 used to create JC Denton.  You, Alex, are the third Denton prototype, a clone of JC.    
21556/0:Tracking creature disturbance.
21557/0:ApostleCorp is not in the weapons business.  Our people here control the biolab -- that's it.  We've been investigating the Mag Rail project ourselves, because it looks like Mako is gearing up for a large arms shipment.  Five hundred thousand units.  We think the guns are headed for the Knights Templar.
21558/0:
21559/0:Logging animal corpse.
21560/0:The scientific name for these mutants is "greasel."
21561/0:Analyzing weapon markings.
21562/0:Investigating device malfunction.
21563/0:Investigating disabled device.
21564/0:Why should I trust someone who spies on me in my own apartment?
21565/0:Investigating moving object.
21566/0:Investigating missing object.
21567/0:Investigating displaced object.
21568/0:This guy, said he was a Knight Templar, he gave me some literature.  It said that the greasel tech was gonna be for humans.  Lizard soldiers who could survive gas attacks, that kinda thing.
21569/0:I saw another special ops type, but she's assigned to Luminon Saman.  I'd like to know what that's all about.
21570/0:Your business is with the Trader.
21571/0:So much for making it big in organized crime.
21572/0:... yes... at last...
21573/0:I can't afford the energy cells right now. [600]
21574/0:Give me the biomod. [500]
21575/0:I don't want to talk to you anymore.  I'm looking for someone who can get me a job at the factory.
21576/0:Surely the Illuminati can deal with a few crackpots.
21577/0:I'd really like to tap into the overachiever market.  They're the ones that get hooked on the stuff.
21578/0:
21578/1:
21579/0:It'll be great to get out of here and back to a normal assignment.
21580/0:Ask Dr. Nassif.  I'm just a trainee -- they moved me here a couple weeks ago.
21581/0:
21581/1:
21582/0:A playful reply.  You must be happy about something.
21583/0:Give me a good clean fistfight any day.  Strategy.  Training.  Skill.  Now THAT'S somethin' to bet on.
21584/0:Praise Saman we got to you in time.
21585/0:We thank you once more for rescuing from the Hateful Ones.
21586/0:The Age of Light is at hand.
21587/0:I have faith in the SSC and the WTO.  
21588/0:He needs to upgrade the Helios core by merging it with your systems.  With access to a living host, Helios will be able to regulate the planetwide distribution of the biomod architecture.
21589/0:Investigating damaged object.
21590/0:
21591/0:Investigating destroyed object.
21592/0:Great place, huh?
21593/0:
21594/0:Investigating open door.
21595/0:Investigating closed door.
21596/0:Investigating active light source.
21597/0:A new program?
21598/0:Investigating inactive light source.
21599/0:Verified: open.  Investigating activity.
21600/0:Verified: closed.  Investigating activity.
21601/0:Verified: on.  Investigating activity.
21602/0:Verified: off.  Investigating activity.
21603/0:You will each be interviewed individually in the near future to determine your interests and how they position you within the company.  Please keep in mind how important security has become.  We are looking for assurances that moving you into these new positions is the right thing at this time.
21604/0:Right on -- goin' for the jackpot.  How much?
21605/0:Oh Jesus!  What's happening?!
21606/0:Alex!  You were right.  Her Holiness put my mind at ease.  What an extraordinary development -- seekers standing beside enclave chairmen!  I never thought I'd see it in my lifetime.
21607/0:
21608/0:
21609/0:
21610/0:It won't open!
21610/1:Why won't this open?
21611/0:I'm trapped!
21611/1:Someone blocked the way!
21612/0:I'm trapped!
21612/1:Someone blocked the way!
21613/0:(grunt)
21613/1:(grunt) I'll FORCE my way through!
21614/0:(grunt)
21614/1:(grunt) I'll FORCE my way through!
21615/0:The system will remain offline, until the hazardous materials can be contained.
21616/0:Just a raid and a few haywire security systems -- no need to be paranoid, right?
21617/0:Investigating fire.
21618/0:I'm not goin' THAT way...
21618/1:I'm not CRAZY...
21619/0:As we try to head off a public relations firestorm over inadequate background checking, we are asking all current employees to submit complete references and resume as soon as possible.  Thank you for your prompt cooperation.
21620/0:I'm not goin' THAT way...
21620/1:I'm not CRAZY...
21621/0:I don't need you, Alex.  I can restore Aquinas myself.  I just sent my commandos into UNATCO to make sure you don't transmit the protocol data to the wrong place.
21622/0:Scanning victim.
21623/0:Too dangerous.  Stay here.
21624/0:Organic fluid detected.
21625/0:Too dangerous.  Stay here.
21626/0:May Her Holiness return soon.
21627/0:Non-human carcass identified.
21628/0:Go on.
21629/0:Thanks... just making the world safer, one mad scientist at a time.
21630/0:Trust me -- Tarsus has a strict policy against voyeuristic behavior by our researchers.  Your living quarters were observed only to insure that our graduates show no behavioral abnormalities after the biomod infusion procedure.
21631/0:We are people just like you.
21632/0:I haven't seen you before. Welcome to our small medina.
21633/0:I engineered the mesh armor in the walls of your cells.  You look fantastic -- this is the first time I've seen my design in a live patient.
21634/0:Just get the job done.
21635/0:We will do business with you, even though you misled the Omar in Cairo, regarding the Templar raid.
21636/0:Maybe it was an ordering fluke?  Something at the distributor's?
21637/0:That's post-Collapse war for ya -- the objective is to seize the territory inside our heads.
21638/0:Anybody.  A lot of people don't like Omar.  Most people think they're freaks.  Right now, supposedly these Knights Templar fanatics are planning a raid.  So I'm waiting for them.
21639/0:I'll get help!
21639/1:Be back in a minute with reinforcements...
21639/2:I'll find the other guards!
21640/0:I'll get help!
21640/1:Be back in a minute with reinforcements...
21640/2:I'll find the other guards!
21641/0:Forget it!
21641/1:You're on your own...
21641/2:Not worth riskin' my LIFE...  Jeez!
21641/3:Sorry -- it's up to you!
21641/4:This can't be happening.
21641/5:Not me!  Please!
21641/6:Oh god.  
21641/7:Why isn't someone stopping this?
21642/0:Forget it!
21642/1:You're on your own...
21642/2:Not worth riskin' my LIFE...  Jeez!
21642/3:Sorry -- it's up to you!
21642/4:Aw, hell...
21642/5:Oh shit...
21642/6:Don't kill me!
21642/7:Time to punch out...
21643/0:It's live.  // businesslike
21643/1:Ha-ha!  Bomb's away!
21643/2:Watch out -- I pulled the pin!
21644/0:It's live.  // businesslike
21644/1:Ha-ha!  Bomb's away!
21644/2:Watch out -- I pulled the pin!
21645/0:Jesus -- a grenade!
21645/1:Hit the deck!
21645/2:It's gonna explode!
21646/0:Jesus -- a grenade!
21646/1:Hit the deck!
21646/2:It's gonna explode!
21647/0:Uh-oh... must be on a trigger.
21647/1:Whoa, a prox mine...  I coulda walked right into it.
21648/0:I answer only to the Grand Master now, and I think I see in your eyes... yes... tell-tale signs of biomodification.
21649/0:I mixed it up with the Templars in the arcology.  Didn't learn much except that they aren't very good marksmen.
21650/0:So you're going to stand out here until you freeze to death.
21651/0:Inventory depleted.
21652/0:I'm EMBARASSED for you, Chairman.  Seriously.  You're kneeling before con-artists.  I'm turning red.  Look at me -- I'm turning red just thinking about it.
21653/0:Without an Omar presence in WTO enclaves, the black market cannot operate internationally.  Shall we conduct business?
21654/0:Patience, Alex.
21655/0:
21656/0:Moron...
21657/0:That was a practical joke.
21658/0:Curfew remains in effect until further notice.  All citizens should remain indoors from 9pm until 6am.  
21659/0:When you have eliminated the threat and spoken to JC, go outside to the abandoned VersaLife base.  You will need to turn on the pilot beacon so that I can land safely and take you to your next destination.
21660/0:Good work.  Power is restored and the beacon is ready to be activated.  Just turn it on and your pilot will be able to land.
21661/0:Uh-oh... must be on a trigger.
21661/1:Whoa, a prox mine...  I coulda walked right into it.
21662/0:These issues must be brought before Her Holiness.
21663/0:Wait -- what was THAT?
21663/1:Shhh.  I think someone's listening.
21664/0:Where are my SMGs?
21665/0:Wait -- what was THAT?
21665/1:Shhh.  I think someone's listening.
21666/0:Queequeg's Coffee.  True to the letter means it tastes even better.
21667/0:Which way?   // urgent
21667/1:See anything?  I've got a score to settle.
21668/0:Which way?   // urgent
21668/1:See anything?  I've got a score to settle.
21669/0:Stick to the dance floor, okay?
21670/0:Did someone come through here?  It's urgent!
21671/0:Did someone come through here?  It's urgent!
21672/0:We're tailing a violent criminal.  Can you tell us anything?
21673/0:We're tailing a violent criminal.  Can you tell us anything?
21674/0:I'll sleep better now.
21675/0:You will close Club Vox until further notice.  Section 876, Transhuman Immigration Violation.
21676/0:Did an armed man come through here?
21677/0:Paul Denton?
21678/0:The SSC tries to be prepared for every possibility... but I just don't see how we could've predicted THIS one.
21679/0:
21680/0:You just haven't ever really STUDIED the Knights Templar.  They have the same basic ideas as the Order Church, but they believe it, they fight for it, and they don't rip off a bunch of other religions.
21681/0:The Others here, you are not like them.  You can see the true path.
21682/0:Sure, the terrorists can get the upper hand in Chicago and Seattle, but nothing like that could ever happen here.
21683/0:
21684/0:
21685/0:
21686/0:I've made some discoveries.  I think I'm finally in the right place.
21687/0:Our willingness to negotiate is met with violence.  This only underscores that the time for talking has passed.
21688/0:I've seen the evidence myself.  He's working for those Purity crusaders -- the Templars.  But you have nothing to worry about now.  I took care of the situation.
21689/0:You have more training than THAT.
21690/0:Hang tight for now.
21691/0:Yes.  I'm listening.
21692/0:I am not permitted to discuss my research.
21693/0:I went up to see what was going on, and all the guards were just standing around.  I mean, really.
21694/0:Here's that biomod.
21695/0:Did an armed man come through here?
21696/0:Did an armed woman come through here?
21697/0:Did an armed woman come through here?
21698/0:I'm not willing to take that risk, but you guys are trained for that sort of thing.  I'm just supposed to be quietly observing students and taking notes, from behind the glass.  Hopefully back-up will show up soon and rescue me, but you don't have that luxury -- you cannot let yourself be captured!
21699/0:They'll be watching to see how we handle ourselves.
21700/0:Quick -- see anything?  Don't want to lose the trail...
21700/1:I need your help with a little game of hide-and-seek.
21701/0:Quick -- see anything?  Don't want to lose the trail...
21701/1:I need your help with a little game of hide-and-seek.
21702/0:What do you know about the Templar defenses?
21703/0:Some weasel's been sneaking around.  See anything?
21704/0:You've shown appalling judgement, Alex.  I share your loathing of the Nassifs, but you've become a threat to a community protected by the Church.  If you won't work with us, I suppose I will have to send in a task force to destroy you.
21705/0:Some weasel's been sneaking around.  See anything?
21706/0:Some guy just got himself in a lot of trouble.  Any sign of him?
21707/0:Some guy just got himself in a lot of trouble.  Any sign of him?
21708/0:I'm too loaded down.  Hold on.
21709/0:Some lady just got herself in a lot of trouble.  Any sign of her?
21710/0:I should be getting some choice cuts by tomorrow morning.
21711/0:I'm not expecting any visitors.  Get lost before I call SSC or take care of you myself.
21712/0:Perhaps you lost someone close to you in the Chicago disaster.  How does it feel?  You going to let it turn you into a killer?
21713/0:Sure, take out the Templars.  [500]
21714/0:Who'da thought?  One minute I'm a nothing trainee, then the fate of the world all depends on what I decide to do.
21715/0:Serious?
21716/0:Combining ancient herbal remedies with state-of-the-art nanopathology research, we have produced the first and only anti-plague-11 tonic, and infused it into this special cola drink, to make it a delicious way to fight the effects of the nanite cloud -- VitaTech Cure-11.
21717/0:Tarsus Tracking Report 4117 -- Alex D.  There are concerns that D. may be the greatest threat among his peers.  Last seen in Cairo, eliminating Leila Nassif for the Order.   Intel suggests that he now has objectives in Trier.  This makes it imperative that we get our agent through the gate immediately and shut it down.
21718/0:Yeah... I admit it.  I'm a fan.
21719/0:Just let her go, Red.
21720/0:Work with us, Alex.  If you show me I can trust you, I am prepared to privelege you like the daughter I never had.
21721/0:I had some of my best people guarding Her Holiness.  I don't know what could've happened.
21722/0:So you're modified?  You must be the one the Harvester is interested in...
21723/0:Some lady just got herself in a lot of trouble.  Any sign of her?
21724/0:It's definitely a secret base of some kind.  Guys in uniform moving in weird machines in the middle of the night.  If you want to get in and check it out, I can tell you where all of the guards are.  
21725/0:We have no choice but to stay here.  We don't get to go back inside your atmospheric barriers at the end of the day.
21726/0:I was a real loser before I landed this job.
21727/0:I don't get it.  How 'bout you?
21727/1:Is that something we should care about?
21728/0:I don't get it.  How 'bout you?
21728/1:Is that something we should care about?
21729/0:No more waiting for the petty arguments and posturing of corrupt human beings.
21730/0:Did you see that?
21731/0:Did you see that?
21732/0:Do you see someone coming?
21733/0:Do you see someone coming?
21734/0:Did you hear that?
21734/1:That sounded suspicious, didn't it?
21735/0:Did you hear that?
21735/1:That sounded suspicious, didn't it?
21736/0:
21737/0:Uh... I think I just touched something.  Am I the only one who's got a funny feeling about this?
21738/0:WHAT!?
21739/0:Thanks for getting to the bottom of this.  Everything's becoming clear to me now.
21740/0:I guess I just got swept up in the excitement.
21741/0:With all that special training, you'd think you'd be able to sense when you were beginning to piss someone off.
21742/0:To prevent us from overpowering our masters by sheer numbers, we were created unable to reproduce.  That is why the Templar threat to us is so dire -- we are all that remains.  And that is why it is especially tragic that even you inflict your violent ways on our kind.
21743/0:They'll be watching to see how we handle ourselves.
21744/0:But can we trust her?
21745/0:Something didn't add up quite right on last night's shipment.
21746/0:
21747/0:Sure.
21748/0:I was HOPING you would hear us out.  Yes -- I worry that you still perceive the Illuminati as a conspiracy.
21749/0:You drink only the finest, most authentic coffee, because you demand excellence in everything you do.  
21750/0:Uh... I think I just touched something.  Am I the only one who's got a funny feeling about this?
21751/0:Did you just see somebody's shadow?
21752/0:Good work.  Now I will take action.
21753/0:Did you just see somebody's shadow?
21754/0:Who's blood is this?
21755/0:Who's blood is this?
21756/0:Uh... okay.  Just tell me who's responsible.
21756/1:Not good.  Who did this?
21757/0:She is ahead of you, threatening to end JC.
21758/0:Uh... okay.  Just tell me who's responsible.
21758/1:Not good.  Who did this?
21759/0:He's already out to get me because I handed his brother over to the Templars.
21760/0:Is the killer still around?
21760/1:I plan to do something about this.  Who's responsible?
21761/0:Is the killer still around?
21761/1:I plan to do something about this.  Who's responsible?
21762/0:We are interested in business opportunities with your kind, but be warned, we will take action against those who might threaten or cheat us.
21763/0:Who killed this man?
21764/0:That freak Denton probably doesn't even see it coming.
21765/0:I can take care of myself.  But why isn't SSC just getting rid of it?
21766/0:Can't call the moves if you don't have a balanced mind.
21767/0:The cockpit of a helicopter is a funny place to try and meet people.
21768/0:You should've kept your eye on him.
21769/0:You should've kept your eye on her.
21770/0:
21770/1:
21770/2:
21771/0:You should've kept your eye on her.
21772/0:The assailant got away.
21772/1:That takes a lotta nerve.  The scab's lucky I didn't get a clear shot.
21773/0:So ApostleCorp has some sort of home base in Cairo.  I think you found your next line of investigation.  Your pilot will be waiting for you on the roof.
21774/0:Who killed this man?
21775/0:The assailant got away.
21775/1:That takes a lotta nerve.  The scab's lucky I didn't get a clear shot.
21776/0:And you want me to break into the place.
21777/0:Who killed this woman?
21778/0:They'll want me to drop that guy next time I see him.
21779/0:I don't think you understand how serious the situation is.
21780/0:Who killed this woman?
21781/0:They'll want me to drop that guy next time I see him.
21782/0:Still breathing... good.  Who did this?
21783/0:They'll want me to drop that chick next time I see her.
21784/0:Still breathing... good.  Who did this?
21785/0:They'll want me to drop that chick next time I see her.
21786/0:I think it's a prison break.  First, too many scabs suddenly have work.  Second, what gets scrip'ed?  The Inclinator.  Metro.  All the TRANSPORTATION, see?  Third, no one takin' these jobs knows what they're for.
21787/0:We still need a lead on Nassif, or we won't know where to send you next.  Double-check the biolab for clues.
21788/0:Be ready in case the psycho comes back.
21788/1:The chief isn't gonna like this.  Any more attacks, we retaliate.  No ifs, ands, or buts.
21789/0:What's that smoke about?  Did someone set a fire?
21790/0:I found peace here, among the Order.  My wish is that you do as well.
21791/0:What's that smoke about?  Did someone set a fire?
21792/0:Who set the fire?
21793/0:Cool.  Just give me the word.
21794/0:It's up to you what you do next.
21795/0:Impressive work, taking down that bot.
21796/0:Where does m'lady wanna fly?
21797/0:My conversation style adapts to the user.  Besides, people tell me things.  The data must be handled responsibly.
21798/0:Did they destroy it or just move it?
21799/0:May you profit greatly during the Age of Light.
21800/0:Be ready in case the psycho comes back.
21800/1:The chief isn't gonna like this.  Any more attacks, we retaliate.  No ifs, ands, or buts.
21801/0:Oh, I'm sorry, I just assumed you were another disgruntled parent... You ARE a parent of one of the students, aren't you?
21802/0:The killer escaped.  This is bad, real bad.
21802/1:Long gone.  Huh.  Cold-blooded assassin.  Wouldn't stand a chance in a straight fight.
21802/2:Damn, the killer must've run off.
21803/0:The killer escaped.  This is bad, real bad.
21803/1:Long gone.  Huh.  Cold-blooded assassin.  Wouldn't stand a chance in a straight fight.
21803/2:Damn, the killer must've run off.
21804/0:So what do you think really happened?
21805/0:Keep an eye out!  If the killer comes back, it's our job to deal with it.
21805/1:Just great.  The killer got away.
21805/2:The murderer's gone.  SOMEBODY wasn't doing their job.  // accusatory
21806/0:Meteorologists have detected a weather anomaly in New York City, that appears to be centering on Liberty Island.
21807/0:Who set the fire?
21808/0:Keep an eye out!  If the killer comes back, it's our job to deal with it.
21808/1:Just great.  The killer got away.
21808/2:The murderer's gone.  SOMEBODY wasn't doing their job.  // accusatory
21809/0:Who opened the door?
21810/0:Another theft on my watch.  Great.
21810/1:Always another crook makin' me look bad.
21811/0:Complete your objective and a new day will dawn for humankind.
21812/0:Who opened the door?
21813/0:Another theft on my watch.  Great.
21813/1:Always another crook makin' me look bad.
21814/0:Who shut the door?
21815/0:Guess it belongs to him now...
21816/0:Who shut the door?
21817/0:Guess it belongs to him now...
21818/0:Did someone just blow up the door or something?
21819/0:Guess it belongs to her now...
21820/0:They may have won this battle, but we'll return better prepared and make them regret this.
21821/0:Did someone just blow up the door or something?
21822/0:Who put that there?
21823/0:Who put that there?
21824/0:It's gone, isn't it?
21825/0:I guess I better just wait here.
21826/0:He owes Miss Sak some money.  We're keeping his jet until he pays up.  Last thing we need is some stranger casing the landing pad.
21827/0:You care about the people who lost everything during the Collapse.
21828/0:Maybe you should follow me to Antarctica.  Billie would hardly be a match for both of us.
21829/0:
21830/0:Pequod's and QueeQueg's are owned by the same people -- it's one company.  I saw the proof in the SSC Evidence Room.
21831/0:Then we will take your blood by force.
21832/0:Pardon the intrusion, but you look modified.  Am I right?  My cousin used to run a clinic.
21833/0:Precisely why I'm hiring you.  You can handle a hostile insertion, right?
21834/0:We'll be outta here in no time.
21835/0:Your instructions were to remain in hiding until one of us contacted you.
21836/0:Guess it belongs to her now...
21837/0:One of those hippo-things had me cornered.  I panicked and locked myself up.  Hey, think you could get me out of here?  This lock shouldn't be too hard to pick.
21838/0:Shall we conduct business, or shall we wait until you upload the schematics of the Templar power armor from the arcology hangar?
21839/0:I guess we let a common thief show us up.  That's just great.
21840/0:I guess we let a common thief show us up.  That's just great.
21841/0:I'm not letting you shut them down.
21842/0:Better be a false alarm...
21842/1:Hello?  There's a guard on duty here, you know.
21842/2:Just once I'd like a quiet shift.
21842/3:That ain't right.
21842/4:Uh-oh.  Better look into this.
21842/5:They don't pay me enough to chase this stuff down...
21842/6:I'm checking this out.
21842/7:Better not be another greasel.
21842/8:That's enough.
21843/0:It's gone, isn't it?
21844/0:Better be a false alarm...
21844/1:Hello?  There's a guard on duty here, you know.
21844/2:Just once I'd like a quiet shift.
21844/3:That ain't right.
21844/4:Uh-oh.  Better look into this.
21844/5:So much for my nap.
21844/6:At least I get to stretch my legs.
21844/7:Okay, that's enough.
21845/0:Just great.  Did you see who did this?
21846/0:I guess they'd want us to check this out.
21846/1:Let's take a look.
21847/0:Just great.  Did you see who did this?
21848/0:I guess they'd want us to check this out.
21848/1:Let's take a look.
21849/0:Where'd the vandal run off to?
21849/1:Oh boy.  I'm in big trouble if I don't figure out who did this.
21850/0:This is just great.
21850/1:Yoo-hoo...?  They let me carry a gun, you know.
21850/2:Don't think I'm your typical rent-a-cop...
21850/3:... you KNOW I'm coming.
21850/4:There goes my last nerve...
21850/5:Hello?
21850/6:Is... is someone there?
21850/7:What's that?  Is someone sneaking around?
21850/8:There!  I could've sworn...
21851/0:Where'd the vandal run off to?
21851/1:Oh boy.  I'm in big trouble if I don't figure out who did this.
21852/0:This is just great.
21852/1:Hey, you know I'm armed over here.
21852/2:I ain't just some idiot, okay?
21852/3:Hey!
21852/4:Maybe this'll get me a bonus.
21852/5:Hello...?
21852/6:Stop foolin' around.  Is someone there...?
21852/7:Guess I'll keep lookin'...
21852/8:Better figure out what it is or I'll be on edge for the rest of the shift...
21853/0:Hey!  Did you see who threw that?
21854/0:I hope you're still with me...
21854/1:I think this is for real.
21854/2:Always happens on our shift.
21855/0:Thank you for saving me.
21856/0:
21857/0:Hey!  Did you see who threw that?
21858/0:The mob from Panzerwerks spread into the city and went after anyone wearing an Order robe.
21859/0:Did you see who opened this?
21860/0:Did you see who opened this?
21861/0:
21862/0:Did you see who closed this?
21863/0:The EMP grenades sound good.  I'll take those. [400]
21864/0:
21865/0:
21866/0:Trier residents will be getting a new cup-o-Joe next month.  Pequod's has announced plans to open a branch in the downtown district.  In related news, the manager of the local Queequeg's has been sacked after starting an altercation with a WTO liason.  QueeQueg's corporate headquarters declined to comment on the incident.
21867/0:This Summit has brought our leader right into the hands of the enemy.
21868/0:Admirable job at the Gate.  I FIGURED they'd bring in a specialist...
21869/0:We are interested in business opportunities with your kind, but be warned, we will take action against those who might threaten or cheat us.
21870/0:Too bad Mathers is trapped on the other platform.  He's got the code for the closet where the repairbot's stored...
21871/0:He's always leaving me.
21872/0:Good luck.
21873/0:No way, man.  I think they already got her with a barrel or a crate.
21874/0:Thanks for being honest with me, Alex.  Somehow I know I can trust you.
21875/0:I hope you're still with me...
21875/1:I think this is for real.
21875/2:Always happens on our shift.
21876/0:Command better beef up intelligence so that no one else gets caught like this.
21877/0:Don't play hide-and-seek with ME...
21877/1:Come on, one more glimpse...
21878/0:Don't play hide-and-seek with ME...
21878/1:Come on, one more glimpse...
21879/0:Maybe that's why they all left -- the soda selection.
21880/0:What have they done to me?  I've never felt so weak...
21881/0:I saw something.
21882/0:Did you see who closed this?
21883/0:I saw something.
21884/0:Who turned it on?
21885/0:Better find out what that noise was.
21885/1:Oh boy.  Sounds like the real thing.  // worried
21886/0:Who turned it on?
21887/0:Better find out what that noise was.
21887/1:Oh boy.  Sounds like the real thing.  // worried
21888/0:Yes... this way... come...
21889/0:Who turned it off?
21890/0:Sounded funny.  I better take a look.
21891/0:I heard he got arrested because he was plotting against the students.
21892/0:Who turned it off?
21893/0:Sounded funny.  I better take a look.
21894/0:Excellent.  My technicians on Ophelia are already configuring the first operational Aquinas Hub in a generation... one which is in orbit and safe from tampering.  Now make sure that JC Denton is dead.
21895/0:Did you see someone messing with this device?
21896/0:Hey!
21896/1:Uh-oh...
21896/2:Just one minute!
21896/3:A-ha!
21896/4:You are going to be in BIG trouble when I catch you.
21897/0:Bring new strength to the world as you shared with our colony.
21898/0:No amount of nanotech rescripting can change what you were always meant to do.
21899/0:They'll be watching to see how we handle ourselves.
21900/0:
21901/0:Did you see someone messing with this device?
21902/0:It's off-line.  Who was just here?
21903/0:Remember: an Omar Trader is always nearby when you are ready to conduct business.
21904/0:It's off-line.  Who was just here?
21905/0:Why's the light on?
21906/0:Well, we fight gobs down here.  Green gobs, brown gobs, baby-stealin' sewer-slinkin' good-eatin' gobs, follow me?  Right now it's Green Dragon in the north chute, Shutterbug in the south.  Walk around, check the fighters, then let me know where you want to put your money.
21907/0:They don't pay me for customer relations.
21908/0:The Templars want to CLEAN UP this scabby planet.  I think they're going to do a good job, too.
21909/0:I should've gone to the factory myself.  Maybe I should just face it -- I was scared.
21910/0:Warning -- Autonomous security systems have been compromised.
21911/0:Your life is out of balance, too focused on objects and acquisition.  Shed the fear and greed that drives you.  Reconnect with the inner order that you have denied for so long.
21912/0:
21913/0:He AIN'T a private.  That was just an example.  He hired all of US, right?  That makes YOU the private.  Now march.
21914/0:There are those in the medina who might get you a pass for a price, but really all they're looking for are mercenaries to do their dirty work.  Me, I just want to help people out.  Give me a few credits for my trouble, and I'll act like you've got a pass.
21915/0:ApostleCorp?
21916/0:(wild laugh)  Thanks for the creds.  Think I'm gonna rag it over to Times Square to see Erin.  For what it's worth, here's a map of the island.  I figure you aren't leavin' that island, so why should I gamble my bird?  Right?  (laugh)  Over -- and -- out, baby...
21917/0:I'd like to get into the penthouse, but I don't have enough credits. [300]
21918/0:Hey!
21918/1:Uh-oh... 
21918/2:Just one minute!
21918/3:A-ha!
21918/4:You are going to be in BIG trouble when I catch you.
21919/0:
21920/0:I see you!
21921/0:I see you!
21922/0:Most predictors seem to indicate that all of the nanological clouds are permanent aftereffects from environmental damage done in the wake of The Collapse.  
21923/0:You!  Hey!
21923/1:You're gonna be in big trouble!
21924/0:You!  Hey!
21924/1:You're gonna be in big trouble!
21925/0:Jerk.
21926/0:Jerk.
21927/0:Chairman Dumier has informed me of your crime.
21928/0:Crazy chick.
21929/0:Crazy chick.
21930/0:We've got trouble!
21931/0:Lovely.  See you at the terminal.  Level 110, Flight Bay 23.  My jet's on a secure landing pad, so you'll have to contact me with the pilot beacon in the northeast corner of the main terminal.
21932/0:I would think that you and ApostleCorp would be bitter enemies.
21933/0:I'm still going to be careful.  Maybe they're just trying to trick us, then strike again when we're off guard.
21934/0:At least I'm straightforward.  Aren't you concerned what your disciples will do when they find out you've been lying to them?
21935/0:I never bet.  I just like to see 'em fight.
21936/0:The Omar appreciate shrewd customers.
21937/0:Yes, it is.  If she is still alive.
21938/0:Leave me.
21939/0:You're listed as a material witness in a criminal case filed by the Order Church.
21940/0:Someday this will all change and you arcology types will be sorry.
21941/0:No problem.
21942/0:When the Omar set their eyes on a particular market, they don't leave you much choice.
21943/0:Just don't stand me up again.  It's not very nice.  So -- you must be here for the Summit.
21944/0:The WTO AND the Order -- at the same place!  The city I grew up in... I can't believe it.
21945/0:
21946/0:
21947/0:We've been with the program since we were thirteen years old.  Why are you so quick to abandon that?  What can the Order offer you?
21948/0:Sorry, I'm broke.
21949/0:You should leave while you can.
21950/0:We've got to get out of here.  
21951/0:I've been following the ApostleCorp investigation very closely.  Your loyalty in this matter would be a great asset.  However, we have a more pressing crisis.  Her Holiness is missing, along with my security chief, Donna Morgan.  I can't be distracted right now.
21952/0:Please.  Let me enjoy my holiday.
21953/0:We've got trouble!
21954/0:This way!
21955/0:This way!
21956/0:Hey!  I'm the authority here!
21956/1:Get back here!
21956/2:You won't get away with this...
21956/3:Yeah, this'll be good.
21956/4:Bring it on!
21957/0:Hey!  I'm the authority here!
21957/1:Hey, you wanna see a portrait in flippin' courage?
21957/2:You won't get away with this...
21957/3:I'm on it!
21957/4:Let's get busy!
21958/0:We've gotta DO something!
21958/1:Find the nut!
21959/0:People should trust Tarsus.  We are the best for a reason.
21960/0:We've gotta DO something!
21960/1:Find the nut!
21961/0:Hey!  What's the idea?
21961/1:I'm warning you -- !
21962/0:Hey!  What's the idea?
21962/1:I'm warning you -- !
21963/0:Hurry!
21964/0:SSC got most of the Panzerwerks rioters under control pretty quickly, breaking up fights and throwing a few people in jail.
21965/0:Here I am.  I keep on living, but why?
21966/0:I guess the situation in the arcology hasn't hurt business.  Aren't you worried that the Templars might occupy the medina?
21967/0:I don't like being spied on.
21968/0:Did he give you any trouble, Chris?
21969/0:Alex D...  You're the last one to arrive.  I suppose that like the others you're after my laboratory and the gateway to JC Denton.
21970/0:I'll think about it.
21971/0:Helios is finished.  Destroy the organic component -- Denton.  He is our last significant rival.
21972/0:
21973/0:Nice one.  The beacon's right there.  Fire it up, and Bob's your uncle!  I'll be down in half a second.
21974/0:No, that's going too far.  I just poke around when they're not home.  There's a master code for all the apartment doors.  For the penthouse though, you need the key to the back door since the elevator's out again.  Since my salary is a joke, both are for sale, if you're interested.
21975/0:Boltcaster -- no need to kill anyone.
21976/0:We'll talk again...
21977/0:Sorry to spoil the illusion.
21978/0:So, Alex, I thought you should know.  I did some asking around.  No one knew who sent you to New Cairo, but I started getting this news out of New York.  And now I find out that that's where you're headed.
21979/0:Hurry!
21980/0:We've gotta confront this guy.
21981/0:We've gotta confront this guy.
21982/0:We've gotta confront this chick.
21983/0:Don't tell me.  You're one of them big-city reporters thinks he's gonna bluff the management into giving him a peek at the new weapon.
21984/0:We've gotta confront this chick.
21985/0:My cousin said he saw NG partying here once. Whatever.
21986/0:I hear you!
21986/1:You make a lotta noise for someone who wants to hide...
21987/0:Normally I'm just a supplier, but with the Summit happening they need a rep who doesn't draw a lot of attention.  Go to the abandoned curio shop above the Nine Worlds Tavern, a place called Der Blutende Rabe.  I'll let the Omar know they should expect a customer.
21988/0:Wow.  Twenty years and no one's touched 'em.
21989/0:Trust me.  Misunderstanding, ignorance, the charade of warring ideologies, war in any form -- all are already historical footnotes.
21990/0:I hear you!
21990/1:You make a lotta noise for someone who wants to hide...
21991/0:Oh, Jeez!
21991/1:Man!
21991/2:Aaaa!
21991/3:U-u-u-u-h...
21992/0:Oh, Jeez!
21992/1:Man!
21992/2:Aaaa!
21992/3:U-u-u-u-h...
21993/0:(growl)
21993/1:Hey!
21993/2:...All right,  that's it.
21993/3:C'mere!
21993/4:This is what I've been waiting for.
21993/5:Okay, break's over!
21993/6:You'll regret this!
21993/7:Here we go!
21993/8:Hope you got insurance!
21993/9:Bring it on!
21993/10:This is gonna be fun.
21993/11:Ha!  I gotcha.
21994/0:I keep track of everyone who goes in and out of this hangar.
21995/0:Be careful whom you trust.  Only the Order can help you retain your individuality and find spiritual balance.  All others are suspect.
21996/0:Wish I could afford the silencer.  [300]
21997/0:Make it quick.  Championship's next.
21998/0:Did the attack on Tarsus seem harmless to you?  These people are crazy and they need to be dealt with.
21999/0:
21999/1:
21999/2:
21999/3:
22000/0:
22000/1:
22000/2:
22000/3:
22001/0:Let's hope she has a sense of humor.
22002/0:
22003/0:Be careful.
22004/0:There's a dance floor on the upper level.  No rough-housing, though.  Someone could fall over the railing and get hurt.
22005/0:Really?  Maybe I should look into this...
22006/0:(growl)
22006/1:Hey!
22006/2:... gotta do something-- I guess.
22006/3:Aw, come on. 
22006/4:This is just gonna end badly, you know.
22006/5:This is all a mistake, loser.
22006/6:Alll right, this is gonna hurt.
22006/7:You're going down.
22006/8:You're going to be sorry.
22006/9:You're goin' down...
22006/10:Now I'm gonna kick your ass!
22007/0:D for "Don't ask."
22008/0:You better not mess with me!
22008/1:Get out of here!  Now!
22008/2:Don't think I won't do my job.
22008/3:Ha!  I've got you!
22008/4:Come on!
22008/5:Let's see what you've got.
22009/0:You better not mess with me!
22009/1:Get out of here!  Now!
22009/2:Don't think I won't do my job.
22009/3:Ha!  I've got you!
22009/4:Ready?  Here we go...
22009/5:I'm takin' you out... Sorry -- we're not exactly trained for negotiations.
22009/6:That's right -- I don't take any chances.
22009/7:You're gonna be in so much pain!
22009/8:Hands up!
22010/0:Tough break, dude.
22011/0:Tough break, dude.
22012/0:I remember a time when these machines were operational.  They were the backbone of pre-Collapse society.
22013/0:Tough break, hun'.
22014/0:Next message:
22015/0:People accuse the WTO of creating monopolies.  In my opinion, the real danger is from the cyborgs.
22016/0:Tough break, hun'.
22017/0:No, no, never abandon your god...
22018/0:Must've escaped again...
22018/1:Scat!
22019/0:
22020/0:Must've escaped again...
22020/1:Scat!
22021/0:Let's earn ourselves a bonus.
22021/1:Trouble!
22021/2:Back me up.
22021/3:We have a troublemaker!
22022/0:All part of SSC duties.  I can't comment except to say the situation will be under control shortly.
22023/0:We've tried everything, but it just keeps going over that same bit of carpet.
22024/0:
22025/0:
22026/0:
22027/0:Hurry!  You're missing the fight!
22028/0:You know Chief Morgan's orders -- start the interrogation.
22029/0:Yeah?
22030/0:Not if we have anything to do with it.
22031/0:I never said I'd fire you.  I just said that we're losing money over this and I may have to let someone go afterwards...   
22032/0:I'll keep that in mind.
22033/0:Just trying to sleep off the chopper ride.  What happened?  The guards practically dragged me to the roof.
22034/0:So.  You fail to appreciate the situation.  At first you looked like a skilled soldier out there, and now you just look like a bloodthirsty monster.  Get your butt to the SSC station.  Now.  
22035/0:I'd like to see 'em try to fire me, though.
22036/0:
22037/0:Stakin' out your turf, huh?  Understood, compadre.  Where to?
22038/0:Maybe I can help get you out of here.
22039/0:Let's earn ourselves a bonus.
22039/1:Trouble!
22039/2:Back me up.
22039/3:We have a troublemaker!
22040/0:This guy made a big mistake.
22041/0:This guy made a big mistake.
22042/0:This chick made a big mistake.
22043/0:I hope this means the Director starts taking those cargo checks a bit more seriously.
22044/0:This chick made a big mistake.
22045/0:We've gotta kill it!
22045/1:It looks hungry.
22046/0:We've gotta kill it!
22046/1:It looks hungry.
22047/0:Good day, sir.
22048/0:Uh-oh!  An augmented dog...
22049/0:Uh-oh!  An augmented dog...
22050/0:Now you've had it!
22050/1:This time you won't get away!
22050/2:Bet you're glad to see me, huh?
22050/3:Ah, reunions.
22050/4:Here we go again!
22050/5:SSC always finishes the job.
22050/6:Aw, just like old times.
22050/7:Bet you thought I was goin' away, huh?
22050/8:I'm back and you're dead.
22050/9:Found you!
22050/10:Thought you'd lost me, huh?
22050/11:I won't miss this time.
22051/0:I talk to everyone that I can.  You're very close but not quite the one I'm looking for.
22052/0:Mr. Dumier sent me to safeguard Miss DuClare's return.
22053/0:Her Holiness inspires us all to reject the selfish utilitarian attitudes propagated by the WTO.
22054/0:Get out of Upper Seattle while you can.  The WTO could decide to arrest you at any moment.  You can reach the lower districts via the Inclinator at the northwest corner of the enclave.
22055/0:I have work to do in Cairo.
22056/0:We need a new generation of leaders -- and a plan for the generation after that.  Succession within the Illuminati is usually confined to about a dozen families, most of whom were wiped out first by MJ-12 and then by the Collapse.  As for Nicolette and myself, we have been unable to have children.
22057/0:
22058/0:Now you've had it!
22058/1:This time you won't get away!
22058/2:Thought you could give me the slip, huh?
22058/3:There you are!
22058/4:You ain't gettin' away this time.
22058/5:This time, you're toast.
22058/6:I'm going to get a bonus for finishing you off.
22058/7:They don't really pay me enough for this kind of persistence.
22058/8:Shoulda stayed in hiding.
22058/9:Ready for more, are ya?
22058/10:Now I've got you...
22058/11:Guess I better finish this...
22059/0:... sick of seein' your face around here...
22059/1:You shouldn't've messed with me!
22060/0:... sick of seein' your face around here...
22060/1:You shouldn't've messed with me!
22060/2:I'm gettin' tired of seeing your face around here...
22060/3:Oh no!  Not me again!  What are you gonna do?
22061/0:... gotta kill this thing...
22062/0:Uh-huh...
22063/0:Biotech Specialist needed in lab 12.  Stat.
22064/0:... gotta kill this thing...
22065/0:We've got another chance...
22065/1:It's not over yet...
22065/2:Let's finish this!
22066/0:We've got another chance...
22066/1:It's not over yet...
22066/2:Let's finish this!
22067/0:I apologize.  My overzealous captain disobeyed orders.  He was instructed to mount a rescue.
22068/0:He's back!
22068/1:There he is!
22069/0:He's back!
22069/1:There he is!
22070/0:Thank you.  You may well have saved my life.
22071/0:She's back!
22071/1:There she is!
22072/0:Hello there, I've got an appointment...
22073/0:The Hateful Ones threaten all that we have worked and waited for.
22074/0:I'm glad to hear it.  Aren't you worried that the Templars might occupy the medina?
22075/0:The vehicle ramp is for loading and unloading only.
22076/0:Because you're an extraordinary creation, Alex.  We've been watching your progress for a long time, waiting for this moment.
22077/0:
22078/0:The Summit meeting must be good for business.
22079/0:Are you another of JC's gone bad?  We did not like the last one's questions.  She works with these intruders.  And now she's gone through the gate to our home, in Antarctica.
22080/0:
22081/0:
22081/1:
22082/0:They haven't been able to unlock my cockpit yet.  I'm ready to fly as soon as you do two things.  First disable the ground-to-air missile batteries, then go to the control room to activate the pilot beacon.
22083/0:Nothing you can give me will help Paul now.  I've joined the Illuminati cause and Paul is dead.
22084/0:Talk about the VIP club to no one, and we will always be here for your convenience.
22085/0:The Knights Templar are already tearing our organization apart.  The last thing we need is one of our own fishing for classified information.
22086/0:We desire schematic data on a new product being developed at that facility.  Exoskeletal armor commissioned by the Knights Templar.  A potential combat threat to our organization.
22087/0:In Antarctica, you helped our kind.  JC tells us you are his ally as well.  We welcome you.
22088/0:I hereby annul your Knighthood.  Without a test subject, my technicians can't verify our counter-nanite and will have to release it blind.  You may find yourself responsible for a plague like nothing the world has ever known.
22089/0:Want a tip?  Bet on Green Dragon.
22090/0:I heard about you guys.  Some sort of special ops unit, I guess.
22091/0:I'll take the black market biomod. [1000]
22092/0:
22093/0:The Order is spiritually rich, but that doesn't buy many private jets.  Go to the Greasel Pit bar.  You shouldn't have any trouble finding a pilot there.
22094/0:The SSC is supposed to be about action.
22095/0:My biomods don't change who I am.  They're tools -- I use them to complete certain tasks.
22096/0:I was going to ask you to investigate the Minister of Culture's penthouse in the Emerald Suites, since we think he has been smuggling equipment to ApostleCorp, but the Mako operation is more important.  You should hire a pilot and leave at once.
22097/0:I'd prefer it if you'd keep your distance until you've been purified.
22098/0:JC will make tomorrow look like yesterday now.
22099/0:I wish the media would stop playing those stories over and over.
22100/0:
22101/0:JC Denton is ready for your help.  Without you, the procedure cannot work.
22102/0:We are here to rescue you from an inhumane scientific experiment.  Hear us.  You have been brainwashed.  Reject Tarsus and the tyrants who established it.
22103/0:
22104/0:I've been specially posted to the Headmaster's office.
22105/0:I can't wait to see the first NG advertisement.
22106/0:
22107/0:I think they're waiting for something.
22108/0:You can salvage nothing from that facility, because the conspriators are dead.  You must go to the Statue and destroy the Denton machine.
22109/0:I'll take a chance on the Claw.
22110/0:Kill him, you fool!
22111/0:
22112/0:I'd put down some money to see NG promote Pequod's.  [500 credits.]
22113/0:I feel like I've really done some good work here.  I can't wait for my next assignment.
22114/0:We were hoping you would run into Dr. Nassif's uncle here, but it looks like he is one step ahead of us.  Now that the hydroponics are out of commission, why don't you pay him a visit?  His apartment is on the second floor of a building across the square from the Order church.
22115/0:For the first time in years, citizens in Old Cairo are able to walk in the open air without the aid of breathers or other apparatus.  Besides the visibly clearer atmosphere, doctors hope to see a decline in the symptoms associated with what is commonly called Plague-11.
22116/0:Interesting.  Thanks for the tip.
22117/0:What?!  Really?
22118/0:Just trying to run an honest business where people can drink without worrying about getting shot at.
22119/0:Would y'all just shut up and scrip' some backup?  I'm goin' in.
22120/0:I brought you something from Cairo, by the way -- the biomod canister on the crate over there.  It was a payment from the Omar.  Personally, I'm done with biomodification.
22121/0:SMALL-TIME?  I'm Sophia Sak!  I'll show you small-time... small time to LIVE.
22122/0:Uh... Hey.  How's it goin'?
22123/0:What would your old friend, Billie, say?  Mmmm?
22124/0:Do you think Dr. Nassif is still in Cairo?
22125/0:That's twice you've sided with ApostleCorp.  Guess you're a lost cause.  If I can't persuade you, I'll have to kill you.  See you shortly.
22126/0:Do not trust this man.  Continue your search -- we need to know Dr. Nassif's location.  Search the director's private office off this room for clues to her whereabouts.  A datacube or vmail may point the way. 
22127/0:I have tried again and again to get accepted into the arcology.
22128/0:So I'm barred from entry?
22129/0:Unusual behavior noted.
22129/1:Behavior heuristic unnacceptable.
22130/0:Just get some rest for now.  I'm glad I could help.
22131/0:Restricted area.  Please leave.
22131/1:Authorized personnel only.
22132/0:Makes sense.  You look like the enclave type.
22133/0:
22133/1:
22134/0:Put your weapon away.
22134/1:Violence in this sector will be answered with force.
22135/0:I knew people who died during the plague.  I wonder how many people died because of the terrorists.
22136/0:Hostility classification: accident.
22136/1:Possible threat: reclassifying individual.
22137/0:Second warning.  Please refrain from that behavior.
22137/1:Threat classification: medium
22138/0:Additional collisions could result in a security reclassification.
22138/1:No further contact, please.
22139/0:
22140/0:Excessive curiosity.  Behavior unclear.
22140/1:Keep moving.  Tampering with security devices is a crime.
22141/0:Normalize your behavior.
22141/1:Stop that activity.  Requesting immediate compliance.
22142/0:Can't complain, I guess.  When I work the slums I get hazard pay.
22143/0:Yes, I watched you.  In time you'll see that it was all worth it.
22144/0:You are ordered to leave immediately.
22144/1:Leave, or you will be reclassified as a threat.
22145/0:Security platforms are authorized to act preemptively regarding unconcealed weapons.
22145/1:Weapons must remain concealed.  Please observe this policy.
22146/0:That's an interesting viewpoint, especially since JC's work made us both what we are today.
22147/0:Real funny.
22148/0:If it was ME, I'd hire a smuggler.  Someone with some experience, you know.  Then the WTO Air Patrol could kiss my ass.  Best place for that sort of thing is the Greasel Pit.  It's just on the other side of the Inclinator tunnel.
22149/0:After the Collapse, we just lost track of so many facilities like this.  And new ones sprang up in the aftermath, unlicensed and unregulated.
22150/0:For Trier?
22151/0:Don't disappoint us like your classmate, Miss Sparks.  This was her mission, but she wouldn't follow through.  Chief Morgan took her into custody and will handle the transport out of the arcology.  Pay attention, Alex.  I'm through sweet-talking you trainees.  Do as we say or your traitorous friend dies.
22152/0:Oh, okay.  Well it is good to hear they are safe.  I will keep their secret.
22153/0:Carry out your orders.
22154/0:Of course I'm listening.  Don't be silly.
22155/0:Maybe so, but you have nothing to gain from murdering an old man like me.  I am quite helpless thanks to these useless bots.  I flew them into the area too quickly, not expecting the cold to be so severe.  The processors in the housing units were damaged.
22156/0:You may pass.
22157/0:The rest of your questions will be answered in due time.
22158/0:
22159/0:Because these are body-doubles for a phony messiah.  Tell me, who writes the little AI constructs that go into those hologram chapels cropping up everywhere?  Don't play dumb with me, Miss Chen.
22160/0:Assault classified as deliberate.
22160/1:Motivation of assailant unclear.  Use of force postponed, pending additional data.
22161/0:That's more like it!
22162/0:Third warning.  Modify your behavior immediately.
22162/1:Threat classification: high.
22163/0:Final warning.  Battle systems ready.
22163/1:Protocol requires that perpetrators be warned before force is applied.  This is your warning.
22164/0:Seeking additional combat units.
22165/0:Engaging the enemy.
22166/0:Proceeding to safety.
22167/0:
22168/0:Affirmative.  Enemy nearby.
22168/1:Enemy activity verified.  Ready for engagement.
22169/0:Area secure.
22169/1:No anomalies to report.
22170/0:I'm just an old bureaucrat.  I don't know anything about handling a real emergency.
22171/0:Identity verified.
22172/0:This summit is just a giant photo opportunity for certain personalities.
22173/0:Proceed.
22174/0:We're so close to bringing the plan to fruition.  Hurry!
22175/0:He isn't exactly safe with my former classmate, Billie Adams, skulking around.  She went over to the Templars.
22176/0:He seems overly concerned about loyalty -- loyalty to what, I'm not sure.
22177/0:What makes you think that?  Why wouldn't she just leave?
22178/0:There's another Apostlecorp lab near the Black Gate, with the usual facilities, plus one major difference -- a teleportation gate that can take you to JC Denton.  
22179/0:Probably hoping to have his brain scanned into a computer by future technology... a mod-freak's version of eternal life.
22180/0:He is, but the merger with the Helios AI has been problematic.  He has fallen into a state of near-catatonia and will be vulnerable until you can revive him.
22181/0:Here you are -- our biggest secret -- walking straight into a deployment of Templars.  Surely you've guessed -- You're the next generation of the technology MJ-12 used to create JC Denton.  You are the third Denton prototype, a clone of JC.    
22182/0:What can we do?  I worry for the safety of Her Holiness.
22183/0:
22184/0:
22185/0:
22186/0:Make it quick.  Gob-zilla's on deck.
22187/0:
22188/0:Systems need repair.
22189/0:We've waited quietly for too long.  We must act swiftly to save humankind from itself.
22190/0:
22190/1:
22190/2:
22190/3:
22191/0:Subsumption (garble garble) error (garble) systems (squeal) error (bleep) error.
22192/0:Systems powering down.
22193/0:Enough strategy.  We have our orders.
22194/0:Autonomous processing interrupted.
22195/0:Autonomous processing restored.  Scanning for source of disruption.
22196/0:Checking sensors...
22196/1:Signal disruption.
22197/0:Result uncertain.
22197/1:Threat probability: low.
22198/0:Can I help you?
22199/0:Reviewing audio data.
22200/0:Get away from me!
22201/0:Resuming analysis of anomalies.
22201/1:Additional data.  Assessing...
22202/0:There's got to be some way to outsmart a camera.
22203/0:
22204/0:It's not that complicated.
22205/0:Come back when you have some news.
22206/0:Thanks.  That could be a big help.
22207/0:I won't stop you, but I can't ensure you'll be safe from the toxic materials or the bots.  If I was you, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of those bots unless I was armed to the teeth with EMP weapons.  I tried to take a bot out with a shotgun one time.  Fat chance.
22208/0:They'll never know what hit 'em.
22209/0:Wait too long, and one of these greedy bastards might slip off the island.
22210/0:Investigating specific threat.
22210/1:Pattern-match highly probable.
22211/0:Where are you going with this?
22212/0:Would y'all just shut up and scrip' some backup?  I'm goin' in.
22213/0:Hold on.  First I need to lighten my load.  I'm carrying too much.
22214/0:Mr. Dumier will remain in the protected compartment -- for his own safety.
22215/0:They had deep roots in the local population and were able to call up a large number of paladins.  In addition, they have deployed a military bot in the mosque and two in the arcology.
22216/0:Sometimes they talk to me.
22217/0:Sorry.  I don't know anything about what's going on in there.
22218/0:What do you mean?
22219/0:I didn't go to the WTO.  The only person I told about the Omar in the VIP area was NG Resonance.  Her simulation, the hologram in the club.
22220/0:Is something going on?
22221/0:You support the new economy epitomized by Pequod's regulated, health-inspected coffee plantations, which have brought jobs and fair pay to tens of thousands.
22222/0:Nice hair cut.
22222/1:Hi there.
22222/2:Don't mind me.
22222/3:Wish *I* could find a pair of shoes like that.
22222/4:It's been a long week.
22223/0:The going rate.  [500 credits.]  But I'm up the swanny until I get those mercs away from my jet.  Maybe you could arrange an accident, know what I mean?  Eliminate Sak and her two-bit security force.  You look like the type.
22224/0:Her Holiness is dead.  I killed her because I found out that she and Mr. Dumier are leaders of a secret society called the Illuminati.
22225/0:He's just using her for her abilities.  Once she outlives her usefulness, I doubt he'll care what we do with her.
22226/0:A biomod infusion succeeds for one of my relatives, and suddenly we are vermin.  All of the Nassifs.  I didn't invent biomodification.  Why do they want to kill ME?
22227/0:But -- how?  Miss Withers is a leech.  You already bribed her?
22228/0:Not interested.
22228/1:Nothing goin' on here.
22228/2:Hiya.
22229/0:Yes.  A cure has been developed by arcology scientists -- a nanite counter-agent for aerial dispersal.  We believe the research is in a private facility leased by the Templars in the Flight Bay 24 on arcology Level 110.
22230/0:Sitting down to talk with our enemies -- and what?  Bow to their demands?  I cannot believe the Order is participating in this summit.
22231/0:You just made my job a lot easier.
22232/0:
22233/0:You have a purpose.
22234/0:Yeah?  Sounds like a fair trade.  13490.  Good luck.
22235/0:Hold on... no room.
22236/0:Explosions -- and a man gets killed -- and they won't give us answers?  How can we possibly trust them?
22237/0:I have been sick for years now.
22238/0:
22239/0:Ever had a Pequachino?  Tastes like laundry detergent.  They put it through seventeen stages of processing.
22240/0:
22240/1:
22240/2:
22241/0:Hang tight.  I'll be right back.
22242/0:The scientific name for these mutants is "greasel."
22243/0:We still do not know who is responsible, but the totality of the destruction leads many to wonder whether this may signal the beginning of yet another Collapse.
22244/0:I don't think so.
22245/0:I'm serious.  I saw the proof in some legal documents I came across in Germany.
22246/0:Thanks.  I'll keep that in mind.
22247/0:The idiot didn't follow through, though.  Tina just pumped Gob-zilla's hide full of zyme, and there's my poor Snake-eyes up against Gob-zilla squared.  Poor guy didn't stand a chance.  What I woulda paid to have the job done right.
22248/0:Yes?
22248/1:How are ya?
22248/2:Quite a day.
22249/0:Do I look like her?
22250/0:So.  The little brat put you up to this.
22251/0:Why'd you sign up?  Money?
22252/0:We simply want to avoid a price shock.  So far, our most promising intel on your former employer points to a possible smuggling operation with Seattle's Minister of Culture, who lives in an Emerald Suites penthouse.
22253/0:It's a good thing you came along when you did.
22254/0:I just walked right into the enclave.  No one checked my ID or anything.
22255/0:Well, I was thinking.  The rumor is that Miss Withers is the one who makes decisions.  If I could find someone who would approach her, maybe offer her some money....
22256/0:All of our secrets are contained in the cells of your body, but no one will be able to make use of them without JC's help.
22257/0:But whose police force?
22258/0:Patience, Alex.
22259/0:The Templars restrict access to their facilities.  Flight Bay 24 is not a public airport.  As soon as you've filled out all the necessary paperwork, they'll be glad to give you a complete tour.
22260/0:Shhhh.  Just tell me if they can go ahead and set up the fight.
22261/0:I've done all I can do.
22262/0:It's not just logic, though.  I think I have the Gift.
22263/0:Who knew the summit would stir up this much trouble?
22264/0:Gonna find him.  Only a matter of time.
22265/0:Repeat: the haze appears to contain only mildly parasitic nanoscale fallout.  Cover your mouth and nose when traveling outdoors, but rest assured: the danger is minimal.  
22266/0:They say I have chosen.  They say they will find me when I'm asleep and complete the operation.  Then I will think like an Omar.  It will be too late for choices.
22267/0:Gonna find her.  Only a matter of time.
22268/0:
22269/0:You're well aware that some coffee chains use polymerized flavor additives, freeze-dried beans, even coffee proteins that have been synthesized by bacteria.
22270/0:You're dead, pal.
22271/0:You're dead, lady.
22272/0:+austin
22272/1:What the hell?  It's gone nuts!
22272/2:Some kinda system error!
22273/0:Maybe you could even our odds?  If the bot out there was destroyed, we might be able to make a run for Old Cairo.  It seems like the Templars do not care too much about us, but the bot is programmed to kill anyone who is not a member of their ranks.
22274/0:No, no, never abandon your god...
22275/0:Thought you'd get away with it, huh?
22275/1:You've got this coming!
22276/0:There she is -- up ahead.  Dr. Nassif turned you into a lab specimen, Alex.  No one will blame you for killing her.
22277/0:
22278/0:Got a killer here.
22279/0:I wish I had enough credits for the multitools. [200]
22280/0:I hope Seattle isn't going to turn into another Chicago.
22281/0:Every day I hear more rumors in the media.  Order fanatics want to destroy the enclave system, terrorists are planning attacks in the night, the Order and WTO are locked in an endless, invisible war...  Not so, citizens.  Her Holiness and I are meeting this week in Trier, Germany, to negotiate better relations.  We do not condemn religion, nor do they condemn free enterprise.  We will find common ground -- have faith in me.
22282/0:Sorry to hear that.
22283/0:I hate to relinquish the arcology to them, but it's time to regroup and devise new tactics for dealing with the Templars now that we've seen their true face.
22284/0:I have heard rumors Her Holiness has special powers.  That has to be a myth.
22285/0:You scoping the place?  Working for Sid Black, maybe?
22286/0:This is Leila Nassif.  Sorry, I'm out of the country right now.  I'll be in touch next time I'm in town.  Bye.
22287/0:Murderer not found.
22288/0:A new civilization -- that's a pretty tall order.  What do you need from me?
22289/0:
22290/0:Everything satisfactory, young man?  I am the owner.
22291/0:Sounds ignored.  Possible deception.
22292/0:Animal behavior unusual.
22292/1:Tracking creature disturbance.
22293/0:Creature is burning.
22294/0:Logging animal corpse.
22295/0:Stay right here.  I'll let you know.
22296/0:Go AWAY, man...
22297/0:Analyzing weapon markings.
22297/1:Residue classification: weapon damage.
22298/0:Do not betray us, Denton.
22299/0:It just seems too surreal-- that the WTO and Order were fictions all along.
22300/0:Investigating device malfunction.
22301/0:Maybe I am.
22302/0:Investigating disabled device.
22303/0:Scans reveal an excellent foundation for biomodification.  You are only beginning.
22304/0:Investigating moving object.
22305/0:Just doing my job.
22306/0:What?  Are you his boyfriend?  Let's see the money.  Hm.  Okay, then.  I guess we can find someone else.
22307/0:Don't wait.  Take care of the job.
22308/0:I saw your daughter's name in the school's recruitment database.  I moved her to the "accepted" category.
22309/0:Engagement unresolved.  Archiving data.
22310/0:Intrusion unresolved.  Archiving data.
22311/0:That elevator was damaged during the attack.  You'll have to use the one in the laboratory on the upper level.
22312/0:Failure to locate the thief.
22313/0:Scan inconclusive.
22313/1:Clear.  Downgrading alert.
22314/0:Responding.
22314/1:Target acquired.
22315/0:Destroying lifeform.
22316/0:Ready for that biomod?
22317/0:Target reacquired.
22318/0:No weaponry detected.
22319/0:Analyzing evasive tactic.
22319/1:Enemy hidden.
22320/0:Target retreating.
22320/1:Enemy position taken.
22321/0:Truly, the Order is not responsible for those thefts.  Thank you for seeing the truth.
22322/0:Fair warning -- we're all a little on edge.  The SSC station is under high-alert.
22323/0:Investigating missing object.
22324/0:Investigating displaced object.
22325/0:Investigating damaged object.
22326/0:Chen means well, but sometimes her methods aren't the most effective.
22327/0:Investigating destroyed object.
22328/0:Investigating open door.
22329/0:Investigating closed door.
22330/0:Investigating active light source.
22331/0:Now I finally get to see the indictment.  It's been a good day.
22332/0:Investigating inactive light source.
22333/0:I have a job to do.
22334/0:Verified: open.  Investigating activity.
22335/0:They station us without any useful intel, and then wonder how we got cornered like this.
22336/0:Verified: closed.  Investigating activity.
22337/0:
22338/0:
22339/0:I'm not supposed to talk to the buyers, so don't repeat anything I just said.
22340/0:Welcome.  It's hard to believe that our hard work is nearly done.
22341/0:I'd like to get back to work.
22342/0:Enemy targeting error.
22342/1:Attack evaded.  Continuing.
22343/0:We hope this will be the last battle.
22344/0:Damage sustained.
22344/1:Analyzing system disruption.
22345/0:Danger.  Hull integrity failing.
22345/1:Circuit damage.  Survivability reduced. 
22346/0:Every society has rules.
22347/0:Systems failing.
22347/1:Hull plates vulnerable.
22348/0:Extreme heat.  Compensating.
22349/0:Why's that?
22350/0:Sorry.  So how do I know which transgenic to bet on?  They all look the same to me.
22351/0:Thank goodness he's safe.
22352/0:Negligible damage.
22352/1:Enemy ineffective.
22353/0:After the results of the referendum were announced on this day last year, demonstrators took to the streets, to make their anger and disapproval known.  
22354/0:As you know, after the Collapse, it was the WTO that started putting the pieces together, creating safe, clean, profitable enclaves, and opening up and regulating trade between them.  With this web of structures in place globally, we can offer an agent many opportunities in many locations.
22355/0:Targeting accurate.
22355/1:Ranged weapon successful.
22356/0:Thanks.  I cannot wait to get out of here...
22357/0:Target eliminated.
22357/1:Successful battle logged for analysis.
22357/2:Countermeasures successful.
22358/0:Very interesting, Alex.  Thank you.  I'm so glad I have a friend I can trust.  Testimony in a bribery case carries a customary reward.  Shall I transfer the funds?
22359/0:Mr. Paladin didn't say nothin' about splittin' up.
22360/0:I don't have one.  How do I get one?
22361/0:Verified: on.  Investigating activity.
22362/0:I'm afraid the school keeps its industry contracts classified, even from us.
22363/0:I'm Bud Puckett.  Remember me?
22364/0:What if I don't want someone peeking into my mind?
22365/0:Verified: off.  Investigating activity.
22366/0:Investigating fire.
22367/0:Daddy says the SSC couldn't fight their way out of a medina playground.
22368/0:My brother died from Played 11.  You wouldn't believe what that did to my father.
22369/0:Carry out your orders.
22370/0:Object classification: human body.
22370/1:Scanning victim.
22370/2:Investigating body.
22371/0:Tell me about this VIP club.
22372/0:Cause of death apparent.
22373/0:Organic fluid detected.
22373/1:Residue classification: blood.
22374/0:Object classification: carcass.
22375/0:Tarsus may have something to worry about, but you and I should be just fine if it's what I think it is.
22376/0:One place where anything can happen, as wild as the outlands seen below our wall-sized window.
22377/0:
22378/0:After exposing yourself to that stuff, you'll be lucky if you don't grow a tail or something.
22379/0:Targeting.
22380/0:Ya cleaned me out.  I don't have any more to sell you.
22381/0:Coordinating with additional unit.
22382/0:Nowhere's safe from an attack like the one that hit Chicago.
22383/0:Summoning additional units.
22384/0:Summoning medical bot.
22385/0:Welcome to the WTO Air Terminal.
22386/0:You could've notified them yourself.
22387/0:It sounds like the missionaries to the enclaves will get to live there.  My family would like that.
22388/0:Summoning repair bot.
22389/0:Unexpected consequence of action.  Reviewing sequence.
22390/0:You'd better be ready.  After everything she's done to undermine the Grand Master's plans, he definitely wants this chick taken down.
22391/0:I'm afraid that in Trier even the most faithful are less than pleased by the appearance of their spiritual leader partnering with the WTO.
22392/0:Pathway blocked.
22393/0:Doorway blocked.
22394/0:I want to report criminal activity at the Tarsus school.
22395/0:Tarsus Academy?
22396/0:It is time for vitakka, applied thinking.  Taking what we desire and reconciling it with what we know.  Vitakka.  Study your meditations.  Nothing pleases the balanced mind more than to bring its good work into the world.
22397/0:Explosive deployed.
22398/0:Some people think we're just focused on profit, but we've got regulations to protect the environment.  Regulations, not mystical chants like the Order.
22399/0:No transaction possible.
22400/0:If I had the money, I'd pay your WTO dues in exchange for that key.  [300 credits]
22401/0:Only a brave or stupid man walks here alone.
22402/0:Thank you.  I'd almost given up hope.  This morning some Templar fanatic murdered my daughter Mina along with a dozen other students.  It was her first day at the Tarsus school.  Don't blame yourself for getting her admitted -- you made us so happy.  Oh!  (sob)  I can't believe it!  I was on my way to claim the body when the Templars attacked the mosque.
22403/0:I didn't come here looking for a fight.
22404/0:Have you lost your mind?  You ensured his safety from the Templars only to murder him yourself.
22405/0:Not with the security grid malfunctioning.  We're fine right here.
22406/0:Lovely.  We have a deal.  I can't wait to do some real flyin' again.  Get in.
22407/0:Director Carnegie from Chicago will handle your inquiries.
22408/0:I'm ready to make a run for it.  The infested air in the medina would be better than waiting for our doom here.
22409/0:So ApostleCorp has some sort of home base in Cairo.  I think you found your next line of investigation.  Your pilot will be waiting for you on the roof.
22410/0:Get out!
22411/0:An acceptable exchange.
22412/0:No time.  You better scout the area.
22413/0:You've shown appalling judgement, Alex.  I share your loathing of the Nassifs, but you've become a threat to a community protected by the Church.  I guess you took out Dr. Nassif for revenge, rather than for the ideals of the Order.  You leave me no choice but to send in a task force to destroy you.
22414/0:
22414/1:
22414/2:
22415/0:Go on about your business.
22416/0:I'm not sure... He and Nicolette DuClare admitted everything to me.  He wants me to go through the ApostleCorp teleporter that connects to JC Denton's sanctuary.  Only the trainees can use it.  Billie already went through -- on a mission for the Templars.
22417/0:Live explosive detected.
22418/0:Sure.  Off the main square, just around the bend from here.
22419/0:Proximity device detected.
22420/0:Targeting error.
22420/1:Failure to damage target.  Evaluating...
22421/0:Your people exterminate these guys like they're a pack of greasels.
22422/0:I found the key some time ago.  I will be using your eyes and ears to gather more data.  As compensation, if you need a pilot for any reason I will be available.
22423/0:Termination authorized.
22423/1:Accessing tactical database.
22424/0:Mission success highly probable.
22424/1:Tactics successful.
22425/0:Thanks for taking the job.  I don't know what the Director was going to do next.
22426/0:Biomods detected.
22426/1:Target employing biomod technology.
22427/0:She doesn't do so bad for herself, considering the state of the economy since the Collapse.
22428/0:Enemy moves at trans-human speed.
22429/0:(bleep)
22429/1:(static)
22429/2:(pops)
22430/0:It is foolish to pass up this opportunity, but that's your choice.
22431/0:Here.  Take that biomod.
22432/0:
22433/0:You sure you're going to stay and fight?
22434/0:I took a peek at the club's records.
22435/0:I don't appreciate you stealing that helicopter, but I'm prepared to overlook the incident if you come through for us at Mako Ballistics.  Get inside the main complex.  Expect heavy security around the perimeter, including automated surveillance and armed guards.  Your assignment will be to locate the prototype of the Templar-funded Mag Rail so that my people can upload a schematic.  More later.
22436/0:Famous last words.
22437/0:Hey, Chicago.  Great tip.  I let 'em close in and then BAM!  Dropped every last one.
22438/0:It's not too late!  Just stop right now, and you won't bring that monster back into the world.
22439/0:Femi!  Come down -- lets go take a walk in the greenhouse.
22440/0:My brother was the one who insisted on working in the field.  I was going to put him on an admin track here at the office.
22441/0:Oh my!
22442/0:Target assessment: vulnerable.  Proceeding.
22442/1:Calculating mission risk.... negligible.
22443/0:Combat situation irregular.  Analyzing...
22443/1:Re-calculating mission risk.... acceptable.
22444/0:Combat situation unfavorable.  Reviewing alternatives.
22444/1:Mission jeopardized.
22445/0:I'll take the silencer. [300]
22446/0:Shutdown.
22446/1:Critical damage.
22447/0:Combat support required.
22448/0:Just a minute.
22449/0:Mission accepted.
22449/1:Executing.
22450/0:I could use the firepower of an SMG, but I'm short on cash.  [800]
22451/0:Scanning.
22451/1:Processing.
22451/2:Surveyed region clear.
22452/0:(bleeps)
22452/1:(hums)
22452/2:(signal noise)
22453/0:What about freedom of religion?
22454/0:Analyzing... unnacceptable.  Please desist.
22455/0:Dr. Nassif should be here shortly.  She's actually been working with the subjects directly and I can hardly wait to ask her what they're like.
22456/0:Whatever lights your fire.
22457/0:Maybe we should leave.
22458/0:Alex, I've been sent to pick you up.  The signal from the beacon will let me land near the VersaLife facility, but first you must speak to JC.  I will circle the area until it's time to land.
22459/0:I paid sixty percent up front.  I'm practically financing his operation.  And now this nickel-and-dime business?
22460/0:Some machines were damaged, but no living beings were harmed.
22461/0:
22462/0:Hell, I'll second that.
22463/0:I am the only world leader who would use this Network AGAINST machine evolution.  Please -- nothing but obsolescence awaits humanity if we go back to microsecond economics.  Revive Aquinas and assign Hub privileges to our computing center in Munich.
22464/0:This school was once an ApostleCorp operation.  The Knights Templar must have penetrated their organization some time ago.  An interesting discovery, but one of secondary concern now that we already know the location of the secret ApostleCorp facility.
22465/0:Unauthorized contact.
22466/0:No smoking in the Mako building.
22467/0:Tarsus has been lying to us.  But I have friends planning a rescue -- this code yellow is probably a sign they're on the move.
22468/0:Please peacefully pursue your business.
22468/1:Loitering infraction recorded.
22469/0:Behavior heuristic unnacceptable.
22469/1:First warning: go about your business.
22470/0:People come to the old city to find the black market.  Is that why you risk getting infected?
22471/0:
22472/0:Clearance denied.  Return to your place of origin.
22472/1:Authorized personnel only.
22473/0:I'm not so sure.  Her Holiness sounded sincere when I spoke with her in Germany.
22474/0:Put your weapon away.
22474/1:Interference with security platforms: not advisable.
22475/0:Possible threat: reclassifying individual.
22476/0:Second warning.  Please refrain from that behavior.
22476/1:Violation noted.
22477/0:Security platforms are authorized to protect their systems with force.
22477/1:No further contact, please.
22478/0:Mmm, what do I see?  An exceptional young woman.  Modified, correct?  Lovingly grown in an enclave -- and now you step into the dangerous world.  Stay ready, Tarik.
22479/0:Keep moving.  Tampering with security devices is a crime.
22480/0:Enough talk, if you don't mind.  You are spoiling the mood.
22481/0:Stop that activity.
22481/1:Behavior heuristic classified as hostile.
22482/0:Uh -- sorry, this isn't Pequod's, that's on 107.  This is the nanoformer bot kennel.  You know?  "We keep the skies friendly...?"
22483/0:Can it be fixed?
22484/0:I'm glad you are willing to betray Tong's confidence.
22485/0:... yes... merging... merging... Find me near the entrance to the sanctuary.  I have so much to tell you.
22486/0:
22487/0:I have five pilots, and you aren't any of them.  This is just PERFECT.
22488/0:If the WTO and Order aren't actually opposing entities, then what's the point of this summit?
22489/0:The Director must be paying you well.
22490/0:Even when her job took her to America, Leila never turned her back on the medina.
22491/0:We meant them no harm, but now we must act.
22492/0:I'll keep a lock on the beacon.  Use it to contact me when you're ready.
22493/0:Leave the area.  Requesting immediate compliance.
22493/1:You are ordered to leave immediately.
22494/0:Distract people from what?
22495/0:Against terrorism, espionage, rioting, and plain old theft, WE protect YOU.
22496/0:Warning: threat classification has been modified upward.
22496/1:Weapons must remain concealed.  Please observe this policy.
22497/0:Assault classified as deliberate.
22497/1:Motivation of assailant unclear.  Use of force postponed, pending additional data.
22498/0:Third warning.  Modify your behavior immediately.
22498/1:Violators are expected to heed all security-platform warnings.
22499/0:Final warning.  Battle systems ready.
22500/0:Seeking additional combat units.
22501/0:Engaging the enemy.
22502/0:Taking backward position.
22502/1:Avoiding threat.
22503/0:Any more pointers?
22504/0:
22505/0:Affirmative.  Enemy nearby.
22506/0:Negative.
22506/1:No anomalies to report.
22507/0:Where'd you get the name Claw?  Looks more like DE-clawed to me.
22508/0:She said that in the life sciences one should never be surprised when the snake swallows its own tail.
22509/0:Yes.  We have rescued you so that you can help us identify and defeat your creators.  Please listen to my High Augur, Lin May Chen.  She will contact you at the holocomm in the other room.
22510/0:No more interruptions, please.
22511/0:This is WTO Security Chief Donna Morgan.   You were told to report to the air terminal.  Very well, but do me a favor.  You just found some financial data that the enclave's Civic Manager is interested in.  I'm sure that he would be happy to give you a Citizen's Bonus if you reported it to him at the WTO Air Terminal.
22512/0:Excellent work.  That gray will surely be grateful for your bravery and kindness.
22513/0:Be careful -- I'm reading a Templar guard on patrol nearby. Are you ready for a direct confrontation? If not, maybe those boxes could be of some use, as cover, or maybe as a distraction....
22514/0:Carry lab I.D. at all times.
22515/0:Why's the light on?
22516/0:Phase II is supposed to be extremely painful.  That's why they give you two months to prepare.
22517/0:Why's the light off?
22518/0:It's good that you can see reason.  Now go back to your penthouse in the arcology.
22519/0:Why's the light off?
22520/0:Think somebody startled it?
22521/0:Think somebody startled it?
22522/0:Stop wasting time -- they're coming this way.
22523/0:Know anything about a trespasser?
22523/1:There's been some unauthorised activity.  Seen anytrhing?
22524/0:Authorized.  Proceed.
22525/0:Know anything about a trespasser?
22525/1:There's been some unauthorised activity.  Seen anytrhing?
22526/0:I don't see any reason to make trouble.
22527/0:Proceed.
22528/0:Someone's been snooping around.  Now what?
22528/1:Get a good look at the scab?
22529/0:Someone's been snooping around.  Now what?
22529/1:Get a good look at the scab?
22530/0:There's been some fighting.  See anything?
22530/1:I've got a dangerous criminal on my hands.  Notice anything?
22531/0:Welcome to the Seattle WTO Air Terminal.
22532/0:By the way, we let Miss Sparks go.  Chief Morgan took her out of the arcology.  I'm glad that we can trust each other, Alex.
22533/0:Leeches.  They want a monopoly on everything -- including security agents.
22534/0:Your patience and fortitude will be rewarded, Lt. Archer. We must wait just a bit longer, but soon we will be free of this menace.
22535/0:How many of your thoughts do you think were given to you as suggestions during your long sleep in Antarctica?
22536/0:I doubt they care much about Plato one way or another.
22537/0:You already joined -- at the kiosk on Level 107, remember?  (laughs)
22538/0:You are true to JC.
22539/0:Thanks.
22540/0:Oh, sure, sure.  I might end up being the first QueeQueg's manager ever to do business inside a WTO enclave.  That's worth SOMETHING.  Here you go.
22541/0:Even in winter, it doesn't get this cold.
22542/0:There's been some fighting.  See anything?
22542/1:I've got a dangerous criminal on my hands.  Notice anything?
22543/0:This thug's mean as gob.  Know what hole we should look in?
22544/0:This thug's mean as gob.  Know what hole we should look in?
22545/0:Talk.  I'm after a murderer.  Know anything?
22545/1:There's been a murder.  Any idea where the culprit might be hiding?
22546/0:Talk.  I'm after a murderer.  Know anything?
22546/1:There's been a murder.  Any idea where the culprit might be hiding?
22547/0:I can't believe you reactivated the Inclinator line.
22548/0:Don't worry -- Paul's safe.  I've already taken care of the situation.
22549/0:The killer can't be far away.  Any ideas?
22550/0:The killer can't be far away.  Any ideas?
22551/0:See where the thief went?
22551/1:See anything?  I'm not about to get shown up by a common burgler.
22551/2:Wouldn't you know it?  I show up to work, and something gets stolen.  Any ideas?
22552/0:See where the thief went?
22552/1:See anything?  I'm not about to get shown up by a common burgler.
22552/2:Wouldn't you know it?  I show up to work, and something gets stolen.  Any ideas?
22553/0:Maybe take a look over there.
22553/1:Not sure... but I have my antennas pointed in that direction.
22553/2:I'd take a closer look over there.  Something just isn't right.
22553/3:Not sure... try that way.
22554/0:Just wanted the chance to give you a quick execution.
22555/0:I've got the master code for all the apartment doors and the key to the rear entrance to the penthouse.
22556/0:We're lucky you came along when you did.
22557/0:First Her Holiness gets taken -- then found-- what a day!
22558/0:
22559/0:If our enemies capture this facility, they'll learn how you were made.  Stand by us, Alex.  You're the one with combat training.  Maybe you could handle the intruders before they reach my companion and me.
22560/0:Are you deaf?
22561/0:Huh?
22561/1:Hello?
22561/2:Maybe something's up.
22562/0:Yeah, I've got business with Leila too.
22563/0:I'm just here to talk to Chief Morgan.
22564/0:I remember a time when they were operational.  They were the backbone of pre-Collapse society.
22565/0:You're in the way.
22566/0:I'm certain.  Fortunately, I got there in time.
22567/0:You can't stop the Templars.  There are too many of us.
22568/0:Maybe take a look over there.
22568/1:Not sure... but I have my antennas pointed in that direction.
22568/2:I'd take a closer look over there.  Something just isn't right.
22568/3:Not sure... try that way.
22569/0:Yes?  Do you have the password?
22570/0:Don't quote me, but I saw someone go that way.
22571/0:
22572/0:Don't quote me, but I saw someone go that way.
22573/0:Shhh.  Not so loud.  He's right over there.
22574/0:(sigh) ... Children.  It's a tough time to be a parent now.
22575/0:Shhh.  Not so loud.  He's right over there.
22576/0:The people seek money and what it can buy -- but what about the heart and the spirit?
22577/0:Shhh.  Not so loud.  She's right over there.
22578/0:Now extend the platform, and we can get out of here.
22579/0:Shhh.  Not so loud.  She's right over there.
22580/0:I caught a glimpse of something... I dunno.  Over there.
22580/1:Try over there.  I think I saw something move.
22581/0:I caught a glimpse of something... I dunno.  Over there.
22581/1:Try over there.  I think I saw something move.
22582/0:I heard something over there.
22583/0:I'm stuck in food products.  My father is VP of Marketing for a WTO-chartered syndicate.
22584/0:The Championship's always nerve-wracking.  Gotta get my cetasikas back aligned.
22585/0:This is not a drill.  I repeat: this is not a drill.
22586/0:Sabotaging a bot production plant -- what were they thinking?
22587/0:A lot like life, isn't it?  Only one gambler comes out on top.
22588/0:Although the summit has been surrounded by chaos and unrest, WTO and Order representatives did finally manage to meet and discuss ways to alleviate the tension between their respective organizations.  WTO Chairman Chad Dumier was proud to make the following announcement:
22589/0:You look modified.
22590/0:During a Code Red, we advise everyone to wear breathers and other protective apparatus.  We urge high risk groups, such as children and the elderly, to avoid leaving the arcology entirely during such a time.
22591/0:The commando has been ordered to self-destruct when he finds the enemy.  This will destroy both of them and help the Illuminati seize some sort of device that's supposed to make them all-powerful.
22592/0:I think I changed my mind about that other key.
22593/0:
22593/1:
22593/2:
22593/3:
22593/4:
22593/5:
22593/6:
22593/7:
22594/0:Where at?
22595/0:After exposing yourself to that stuff, you'll be lucky if you don't grow a tail or something.
22596/0:Uh, sorry.
22597/0:You mean kill everybody on the island?
22598/0:If you're ready to leave, just head out, and the sensors will automatically reactivate everything.
22599/0:I heard something over there.
22600/0:I follow you so far.
22601/0:Who could've guessed this was where we'd end up when we signed up for Tarsus, eh?
22602/0:
22602/1:
22602/2:
22603/0:No idea.  Sorry.
22603/1:Your guess is as good as mine.
22603/2:Eh, it's nothing.
22604/0:No idea.  Sorry.
22604/1:Your guess is as good as mine.
22604/2:Eh, it's nothing.
22605/0:The mastermind behind Chicago has no such adaptability.
22606/0:Hello.
22606/1:Hey.
22607/0:Tell his bodyguard that you're handling the SMG shipment for an arms smuggler named David Kurczec.  That will get you inside the apartment.  Do this, and I will pay you a handsome reward [300 credits], plus a VIP membership.  Repeat anything I just said, however, and you will join Mr. O'Rourke in a long trip to Lower Seattle from the Space-Needle overlook.  Thank you for choosing Club Vox.
22608/0:Hello.
22608/1:Hey.
22609/0:Hi.
22609/1:Hey.
22610/0:Hi.
22610/1:Hey.
22611/0:What's it mean for us?
22612/0:Officer.
22612/1:How's it going?
22612/2:Ever feel like you're going in circles?
22613/0:Officer.
22613/1:How's it going?
22613/2:Ever feel like you're going in circles?
22614/0:Send Mr. Kirkpatrick our regards.
22615/0:Any idea what's going on around here?  This Dr. Nassif is telling me to ignore what sounded like an explosion and I just saw a man killed in the hallway.
22616/0:We meet again. // bored
22616/1:What's up.
22617/0:
22618/0:
22618/1:
22618/2:
22618/3:
22618/4:
22618/5:
22618/6:
22618/7:
22619/0:What is the little sprout's answer?
22620/0:You're not the first global church.
22621/0:Guess you're cracking out of luck, then.
22622/0:Well, I'm just glad when one of my fans believes in something besides gossip and celebrities.  Wanna know what I think?  I think there's nothing wrong with being a rich kid from a WTO enclave and still having some spirituality.
22623/0:I was called in to help with this Templar debacle... for all the good it did the SSC.
22624/0:From now on, you better watch your back.
22625/0:Every society has rules.
22626/0:Alex, you have made a poor decision.  I'm on the north dock.  Come talk to me and reconsider your actions.
22627/0:Oops...
22628/0:We are not permitted to know the identities of the test subjects.
22629/0:You're welcome to listen in.  Just don't disturb the worshippers.
22630/0:Now extend the platform, and we can get out of here.
22631/0:The Templars are one step ahead of us, but not for long.  Repair the Gate with the Sequencing Module.  Your long-lost older brother is waiting for you on the other side.  I don't care how much you may hate us, you will try to save your brother.  I am certain of that.
22632/0:
22633/0:Now that the beacon's been activated, it won't be long until we're far away from these nuts.
22634/0:We meet again. // bored
22634/1:What's up.
22635/0:Know where I can get a decent pilot?
22636/0:Hi!  // overly warm
22637/0:Hi!  // overly warm
22638/0:Hello, sir.  // buoyant
22639/0:Hello, sir.  // buoyant
22640/0:Hello, miss.  // buoyant
22641/0:Hello, miss.  // buoyant
22642/0:Yes... How are you?  // overly sincere
22642/1:Well!  You again!
22643/0:There's no way Sak's making this kind of money honestly.  I bet she's a smuggler.  And not only are the authorities looking the other way, we're working for her.
22644/0:Yes... How are you?  // overly sincere
22644/1:Well!  You again!
22645/0:Dumier has declared you an ally.
22646/0:Are you sure you're right about that?
22646/1:It's really happening, isn't it?
22646/2:What you were just saying.  Are they serious?
22646/3:Now -- about that rumor.  It's for real?
22646/4:That little remark.  You better take it back, or... maybe it's true?
22647/0:I thought you said JC was powerful.
22648/0:I'll take the black market biomod. [1000]
22649/0:I'll get back to you.
22650/0:Honey?
22651/0:Of course they....  Wait a minute -- you don't work for Mr. Kurczec!
22652/0:"Meet other outgoing, particulate-infected singles."  (bitter laugh)
22653/0:We will need the Denton body for the experiment.
22654/0:Sometimes High Augur Chen has her head in the clouds.
22655/0:Real cute.  Just give me the money.
22656/0:
22657/0:The drop site is the Black Gate Ruins, west tower, top floor.  In an unmarked silver footlocker.
22658/0:A lot of pretty phrases flying around, but it's all about one thing: money.
22659/0:Word is leaking out that Her Holiness and I have been secretly working together.  I think we can spin that into "diplomatic ties."
22660/0:Okay.
22661/0:Alex Denton, welcome to your brother's sanctuary.  My assignment is to answer your questions and provide transportation.
22662/0:Are you sure you're right about that?
22662/1:It's really happening, isn't it?
22662/2:What you were just saying.  Are they serious?
22662/3:Now -- about that rumor.  It's for real?
22662/4:That little remark.  You better take it back, or... maybe it's true?
22663/0:Yep.
22663/1:I wouldn't make something like that up.
22663/2:You callin' me a liar?
22663/3:You didn't hear it from me.
22663/4:It's supposed to be a secret.
22664/0:The students have nothing to worry about.
22665/0:Yep.
22665/1:I wouldn't make something like that up.
22665/2:You callin' me a liar?
22665/3:You didn't hear it from me.
22665/4:It's supposed to be a secret.
22666/0:But they said we'd be off that day.
22666/1:I want my bonus.
22666/2:What?  They think we do this cuz we LIKE it?
22666/3:That's it!  I'm startin' a union!
22666/4:My hair ain't too long.  Jeez!
22666/5:But they killed her!
22667/0:Suits me just fine.  You don't get anywhere in this outfit without combat experience.
22668/0:But they said we'd be off that day.
22668/1:I want my bonus.
22668/2:What?  They think we do this cuz we LIKE it?
22668/3:That's it!  I'm startin' a union!
22668/4:My hair ain't too long.  Jeez!
22668/5:But they killed her!
22669/0:I think I've been over that way.
22670/0:What can we do?  // resigned
22670/1:The best thing is not to rock the boat.
22670/2:Can't say I'm surprised.
22671/0:What can we do?  // resigned
22671/1:The best thing is not to rock the boat.
22671/2:Can't say I'm surprised.
22671/3:They've got the authority...
22672/0:Huh?
22672/1:Eh?
22672/2:Oh?
22673/0:I wish I didn't have to get up for work in the morning.
22674/0:Hello?
22674/1:Maybe something's up?
22675/0:There it is again.
22675/1:I wonder what that's about.
22676/0:One of the other trainees, Billie Adams, has already gone through the gate.
22677/0:Stick with us, Alex.  The WTO is good to its people.
22678/0:I don't know about this...
22679/0:It's just a handful of rejects that badmouth the Charter System.
22680/0:I used to live here and believe everything Dumier said, until I realized that enclaves do the real brainwashing -- convincing people it's a free market where everyone can succeed if they work hard enough, when in fact it's all controlled to keep the wealth in the hands of a select few.  I'm trying to wake them up.
22681/0:
22682/0:We are desperate people.
22683/0:Don't DO this, Alex!  
22684/0:Now I can expand into Lower Seattle without worrying too much about price-point.
22685/0:She's back!
22685/1:There she is!
22686/0:Please -- I know too much already, and my living situation in Lower Seattle is not secure.
22687/0:
22688/0:... got the draw on ya...
22688/1:Surprised?
22689/0:
22690/0:... got the draw on ya...
22690/1:Surprised?
22691/0:
22692/0:You deaf?  I said I wanna get me a fly leather outfit like the one you're wearin'.
22693/0:I think something's going on here.
22693/1:That's a bit unusual.
22694/0:Well, now I'm paying attention...
22694/1:That's definitely not right.
22695/0:What's going on?!
22695/1:Gonna to put a stop to this.
22696/0:I'm going to take care of this.
22696/1:This has got to stop.
22697/0:Hey!
22697/1:Gah!
22698/0:(laughing) Yeah... get a good look at those creatures yet?  Jesus.  Born in a lab and then living out here like savages, JC Denton the only human being within a thousand miles.  I wonder if he really merged his brain with an AI.
22699/0:Looks it's gone, whatever it was.
22699/1:Nothing to worry about now.
22700/0:Something must be after it.
22701/0:Really -- I can't believe the Mechanics Union -- or whoever it was -- thought they could decide global policy for the rest of us.
22702/0:Poor thing.
22703/0:Hmmm...
22703/1:That's odd...
22704/0:Gah!
22704/1:(shriek)
22704/2:(yell)
22705/0:Stay here.
22706/0:I have always wondered what they do in there...
22707/0:How do you plan to do that?
22708/0:I've got my eye on you.
22709/0:I think it will, because --
22710/0:I got myself here.  Now you want me to stand around doing nothing?
22711/0:
22712/0:You could say that....
22713/0:I will, sweetie.  Hey, thanks for being here for me.  I love this, and I love US.  But you know that I've got to get back.  I'll send word when I find an apartment.
22714/0:Still, I'm worried.  We need to uproot this ApostleCorp before they compromise our modernization.  I hear that the Grand Master will be ready to act within two months, but our army will need to be a match for all other armies combined.
22715/0:Gotta keep steady...
22715/1:I'm warnin' you -- I'm a pretty good shot!
22715/2:Just gimme a shot...
22715/3:Time to break the piata...
22716/0:Gotta keep steady...
22716/1:I'm warnin' you -- I'm a pretty good shot!
22716/2:Just gimme a shot...
22716/3:Time to break the piata...
22717/0:I'm gonna do it, man!
22718/0:Oh my God -- a body!
22718/1:Not moving... uh-oh...
22719/0:I'm gonna do it, man!
22720/0:Just a trick.
22721/0:I'm gonna do it, lady!
22722/0:Looks like things got a little out of hand here.
22723/0:I'm gonna do it, lady!
22724/0:How did that move?
22725/0:My shot!
22725/1:I've got an angle!
22726/0:We have been instructed to let you pass.
22727/0:Do you see the kitties?
22728/0:Now where did it go?
22729/0:My shot!
22729/1:I've got an angle!
22730/0:Afraid that's the case.  In fact, he hired me to kill you.
22731/0:
22732/0:I don't think that's where it should be.
22733/0:I'll take care of him!
22734/0:That took a beating.
22735/0:Wow -- someone destroyed that.
22736/0:Why Miss Sak trusts a scab flyer like Sid, I'll never know.
22737/0:Oh great -- it's malfunctioning.
22738/0:Someone must've powered this down.
22739/0:That's one of them.
22740/0:I bet we're being targeted by the WTO.  They would love to see the greenhouse fail.
22741/0:At least I got you moving.  The Leo Jankowski I met in Seattle doesn't stand around moping about his problems.
22742/0:This is harassment.
22743/0:I'm a little low on funds right now.
22744/0:When was the last time you got any sleep?
22745/0:An interesting discovery.  So Dr. Nassif has a cousin at the Tarsus Academy in New Cairo.  That would have been very useful information, but we already know that the secret ApostleCorp facility is on level 108 of the arcology.  You can still use the visitation pass to enter the school on Level 107, though, if you're curious.
22746/0:Quit wasting my time.
22747/0:Guess there's not much we can do yet.
22748/0:Yeah.  Who's there?
22749/0:I guess I made a mistake.  I thought Tarsus put out a different sort of product.  Here's your money, bandito.
22750/0:I'll take care of him!
22751/0:I'll take care of her!
22752/0:I'll take care of her!
22753/0:Now why is this open?
22754/0:Shouldn't this be open?
22755/0:Bot -- engage target, highest priority.  // talking to bot
22755/1:Go!  Go!  Go!  Full authorization!
22756/0:That should be off.
22757/0:Bot -- engage target, highest priority.  // talking to bot
22757/1:Go!  Go!  Go!  Full authorization!
22758/0:Shouldn't this be on?
22759/0:Oh God... Better call a bot.
22759/1:Wish the bot would hurry up...
22760/0:However ruthless, the Templars will be no match for a WTO and Order alliance.
22761/0:I can't get by!
22762/0:Oh God... Better call a bot.
22762/1:Wish the bot would hurry up...
22763/0:Door's stuck.
22764/0:Notifying a repair bot...
22765/0:
22766/0:Gotta move this myself.
22767/0:This is WTO Security Chief Donna Morgan.  I don't know what the hell you think you're doing, but you better get your ass to the WTO Terminal.  That's an order.
22768/0:
22769/0:That's too dangerous.  Better stay back.
22770/0:
22771/0:...in my sights...
22772/0:Was there nothing you could do??  We're all in danger now -- Panzerwerks has erupted into a riot just as Her Holiness arrived in Trier to try to soothe tensions between our church members and the factory's workers.
22773/0:The going rate.  [500 credits.]  But I'm up the swanny until I get those mercs away from my jet.  Maybe you could arrange an accident, know what I mean?  Eliminate Sak and her two-bit security force.  You look like the type.
22774/0:Playin' it safe, huh?  How much?
22775/0:You kids really are a bunch of brats.  Well, I'm going to do my duty... if only for all the SSC that got taken down today.
22776/0:Cairo.
22777/0:The bookie's at the south door.
22778/0:Keep movin'.
22779/0:
22780/0:You some sort of WTO special agent?
22781/0:So much is at stake that a few sacrifices are more than acceptable.  We're talking about the survival of a pure human race.  Someday you will see that our cause is just.  For now, there's nothing you can do for these students.  It's too late.
22782/0:Notifying a repair bot...
22783/0:Notifying a med bot...
22784/0:Intel says you're taking down your fair share of Order troublemakers.  Good to have someone like you on our side.
22785/0:Notifying a med bot...
22786/0:Thank God, she's all right.  Thanks for taking down enough of those Templar outlaws to make it easy for my people to move in.  Now let's follow up on what Her Holiness learned about Luminon Saman.  Go to the tavern and hire a pilot.  If you wouild like a map of Saman's compound, report to the SSC Station on your way across town.
22787/0:Better let the drone handle it...
22787/1:No need to stick out my neck when I could use a drone.
22788/0:You gave my brother to the Templars.  Now he's a laboratory specimen, if he's alive at all.
22789/0:Better let the drone handle it...
22789/1:No need to stick out my neck when I could use a drone.
22790/0:Time to send in a bot.
22791/0:Damn!
22791/1:I missed!
22792/0:If only we could release the repair bot... or get to the controls for the hazard flush system.  Too bad no one has the equipment to make it over there.
22793/0:I'll let a bot take care of this.
22794/0:Damn!
22794/1:I missed!
22795/0:What am I doing wrong?
22796/0:
22797/0:What am I doing wrong?
22798/0:Got a problem?
22799/0:Gotta show this thing who's boss.
22800/0:I can't hit him!
22801/0:... everyone is a little bit broken...
22802/0:(grunt) Oh God, I'm hit!
22803/0:(grunt) That got my attention.
22804/0:(groan) I don't think I'll last much longer.
22805/0:
22806/0:It burns!
22807/0:The point is that governmental units need not be territorial.  The proof is all around us.  After the Collapse, communication grids came back up before industry, so what has evolved are many global associations incapable of seizing very much territory.
22808/0:Hey, buddy.  I just heard from Eddie downstairs.  He can stall a little while longer if you need more time to... you know.
22809/0:You're free to proceed.  We're just warning people to steer clear of that bot.
22810/0:Look.  Bodies everywhere, mercenaries fighting over a few wires in the ground.  And this place used to be a symbol of freedom.
22811/0:I wonder what will happen next...
22812/0:And Mako Ballistics is reporting that terrorists have infiltrated their Redmond facility and have stolen the plans for a weapon prototype.  The chief engineer was killed in the attack.
22813/0:Sounds like you're having second thoughts.
22814/0:
22815/0:I just want everything to get back to normal.
22816/0:What about the SSC?
22817/0:I can't hit him!
22818/0:I can't hit her!
22819/0:I've learned a lot since leaving Chicago...
22820/0:I can't hit her!
22821/0:
22822/0:Get it!
22823/0:Scrambler grenades -- give me those. [300]
22824/0:Get it!
22825/0:You tryin' to lose me?
22825/1:Get back here!
22825/2:Come on out!  You scared? 
22825/3:Get back here!  I'm serious.
22826/0:Good, you found the facility.  Transmit the specification to the WTO orbiting science platform, Ophelia, then you will be free to destroy that illegal machine inside the Statue.
22827/0:You tryin' to lose me?
22827/1:Get back here!
22827/2:Don't you run away from ME!
22827/3:Sneaky... but I'm not your average SSC clown...
22827/4:HEY -- I'm the one in charge here!  Where'd you go?
22827/5:Get out here and let's talk it over...
22827/6:I know, combat's stressful.  But you've gotta learn to face your fears...
22827/7:Know what?  I like to hunt.  Now why don't you share something about yourself...
22828/0:Hope he took off...
22828/1:Maybe he's trying to hide...
22828/2:(to self) Where'd he go?  Gotta finish this...
22828/3:(to self) Oh, man.  Captain's gonna kill me if I lose him.
22829/0:Hope he took off...
22829/1:Maybe he's trying to hide...
22830/0:So.  The little brat put you up to this.
22831/0:Hope she took off...
22831/1:Maybe she's trying to hide...
22831/2:(to self) Where'd she go?  Gotta finish this...
22831/3:(to self) Oh, man.  Captain's gonna kill me if I lose her.
22832/0:As soon as that beacon's activated, we'll all breathe a bit easier.
22833/0:The WTO should crack down on these Templars.
22834/0:I don't think they'll waste time on a trial -- not where assassination is concerned.
22835/0:
22836/0:In time, it will all become clear.
22837/0:Pass is good all night.
22838/0:Had to get out of town pretty fast.  Fortunately, this guy Leo needed a ride and could give me some fuel money.
22839/0:Leave me alone.
22840/0:Do you need a pilot?  My helicopter is on the landing pad in the town outside the arcology.  Here's a photo so you can spot me quickly.
22841/0:Luminon Saman inspires a greater devotion among some members, which is a wonderful effect, I guess...
22842/0:That and much more.  We're now ready to transform the human race.  It became clear to me after the defeat of MJ-12 that the old answers to tyranny are inadequate.  I needed the Helios merger in order to contemplate the problem effectively.
22843/0:Oh, sure.  That was the luxury terminal where my jet used to land.  I never understood why the city closed it.
22844/0:
22844/1:
22844/2:
22845/0:I'll let you know.
22846/0:Hope she took off...
22846/1:Maybe she's trying to hide...
22847/0:
22848/0:You found me!  Hey, where's your suit?  You one of us?
22849/0:Guess we better take a look around.
22849/1:I don't think we're out of this yet.
22849/2:Watch yourself.  This one's got some fight.
22849/3:Just watch my back.
22850/0:If they were fair about letting people live in the arcology, no one would have to worry about the Swell at all.
22851/0:Guess we better take a look around.
22851/1:I don't think we're out of this yet.
22851/2:Stay sharp... this isn't over yet... 
22851/3:We're almost done here... stay with me.
22851/4:Simple -- we'll just canvass the whole area.
22851/5:We're not in the clear yet, so no grab-assin'...
22851/6:Don't chicken out on me.  Come on.
22852/0:I'm trying to be patient, but I still haven't received my RJ-4 nanomanipulators.  It's holding up the whole project.
22853/0:I don't know how much longer I can stand breathing the air out here in the medina.
22854/0:Maybe he's still around.
22854/1:Spread out.  We'll get a big bonus if we find this dude.
22854/2:Yell when you see him.
22854/3:Big guy, huh?  Can't hide for long.
22854/4:Where'd he go?  Did I hit him? 
22855/0:Seek a binding principle in all that you do.  That is the only way any of us can escape the ties and tangles of which we are made.
22856/0:Maybe he's still around.
22856/1:Spread out.  We'll get a big bonus if we find this dude.
22856/2:He won't be able to slip past us...
22856/3:We're not going to let him get away!
22857/0:We meant them no harm, but now we must act.
22858/0:Maybe she's still around.
22858/1:Spread out.  We'll get a big bonus if we find this chick.
22858/2:Yell when you see her.
22858/3:I can't see anything.  Think she's gone?  
22858/4:Check everywhere.  She's gotta be here.
22859/0:The intellectual property has been secured.  It will be analyzed by our experts.  Well done.  Your pilot will be waiting for you on the roof.
22860/0:Maybe she's still around.
22860/1:Spread out.  We'll get a big bonus if we find this chick.
22860/2:She won't be able to slip past us...
22860/3:We're not going to let her get away!
22861/0:I don't know about you, Edward, but I'm starting to get concerned.  We've lost contact with the other bases and with headquarters.  I think something terrible must've happened to the net, or maybe even to the world...  
22862/0:I'll just be glad when we can make the drop for the Omar.
22863/0:Very well.
22864/0:I'm on my way to the SSC Station right now.  Can you give me directions?
22865/0:Nothing you can give me will help Paul now.  I've joined the Templar cause.  I let them draw my blood and transport him away.
22866/0:Hi!  This is Klara... Sorry -- I'm not in my quarters right now.  I'm probably on the lower level for training.  But thanks for stopping by!
22867/0:We can handle them, no problem.
22868/0:Her Holiness and I amicably disagree also.  My Shard in Germany has a profound respect for the founding doctrines of the Order.  What we don't understand are these recent revisions and reversals that seem to excuse the resurgence -- through the WTO -- of blind commercial interests.
22869/0:I don't know what they're thinking.  They can't fool the WTO forever.
22870/0:
22871/0:I don't see any reason to make trouble.
22872/0:Thank God -- someone from the outside.  I'd make a run for the medina if the floor of the mosque could be secured, but no one will fight.  Seekers.  SSC.  They've all vanished.
22873/0:Exchange completed.
22874/0:Wherever you want to go.  I'll be right here.  [500 credits.]
22875/0:I told you -- Tarsus is a front.  No one's quite sure what ApostleCorp is after.
22876/0:If I go down fighting bigots, I guess that's not so bad.
22877/0:That's easy for an outsider to say.  If I don't weigh the consequences the city might get sued -- or I could lose my job.
22878/0:Must be some sort of quantum effects on those particles.  That's my theory.
22879/0:I wish I could've afforded a REAL doctor.  The woman I saw?  She was more interested in hunting down the greasel than in fixing my toe.
22880/0:I like Bud.  He's one of my biggest fans.
22881/0:Hold on -- I can't carry anything else right now.
22882/0:And where are they getting this firepower and training?  Obviously they're organized.
22883/0:Thanks.
22884/0:Match 7!  Gobs are in the chute!  Buy-in is the house minimum.  [100 credits.]  Odds are one-to-one.
22885/0:A sympathetic ear, for now.  Believe me, child of the City of Destruction, the last days of humankind may be at hand.  Help me when I call on you, and I will have no need to destroy more cities.  Only one ApostleCorp facility remains, and I simply need the device JC Denton has assembled there...
22886/0:I haven't had the chance to talk to her yet.
22887/0:What "procedure?"
22888/0:They'll have to replace the entire inventory.
22889/0:I hope those security problems were the worst of it.
22890/0:I know it's scary, but don't worry, they'll find the terrorists.  And we're very safe here in the arcology.
22891/0:Who are you -- Brett Steed?  You recording this for Talk Bullet?  Attorney-client privilege, my friend.  Get used to it.
22892/0:People didn't know what was happening -- the system just started to open fire.
22893/0:YEAH I work here.
22894/0:
22895/0:Busy man.
22896/0:Trier is your home.  Surely you must have some insight into why they would kidnap your lady, Her Holiness.  She is practically a patron saint in this district.
22897/0:No?  Then what?  Do you know who is after my family?
22898/0:Welcome to WTO HQ for Seattle.  Always glad to talk to potential recruits.
22899/0:The Omar appreciate good customers.
22900/0:It always helps to know who you are working for.
22901/0:Hi.  I'm NG Resonance.  One thing I can't stand is imitation.  That's why I'm so uncompromising with my music, and that's why I drink QueeQueg's.  A tall, foamy Queeqachino makes me feel good because I know it was made from real coffee beans grown the old way, organically, by independent farmers.  Pretty cool, huh?  Not to mention the edge it gives me before a big show.  I don't know what I'd do without my QueeQueg's.
22902/0:I don't know what sort of funny business you have in mind, but if that woman dies so do you.  At first you looked like a skilled soldier out there, but now you just look like a maniac.  Get your butt to the SSC station.  Move!
22903/0:Thanks.  That could be a big help.
22904/0:I'd like your help, but I don't have the money.  [200 credits.]
22905/0:Our admiration to all those inside and out of protected enclaves.  Together, we face each uncertain day with resolve and courage.
22906/0:I have no money, but I'm a doctor.  I'd be willing to tend to any battle wounds.
22907/0:I'd like to know what they feed that gob to make it so damn invincible.
22908/0:Figures they'd ship me to a warzone...
22909/0:Hey, I'm looking for the Nine Worlds Tavern.  Can you give me directions?
22910/0:Uh... Hello, Stan.  Are you sure?
22911/0:The Age of Light is at hand.
22912/0:Paladins have been instructed to hold their fire against you.
22913/0:Whatever lights your fire.
22914/0:More than that, if you ask me.  People have to think alike before they can act alike.  I think WTO types should listen to seekers, just as seekers should learn to see the benefits of the WTO.
22915/0:This toxic spill in the Inclinator has shut down operations.  The area's been closed off and they've deployed bots to patrol and secure it.  The WTO is reaping the benefits of its harmful industries -- I guess a little pollution is all in a day's work up there.  May Her Holiness watch over you as you try to face these obstacles.
22916/0:We have no more use for you here.
22917/0:Something's happening....  another squad of terrorists.
22918/0:Mako isn't stupid.  They'll know they've been infiltrated if the entire bioinformatics team disappears overnight.
22919/0:
22919/1:
22920/0:Intel points to Antarctica.  There's no quick or easy way to follow up on this remotely.  Requesting deployment of an expeditionary force to the coordinates we've got.  We'll need some special troops for this, power armor and extreme weather gear.
22921/0:You can tell a champ by the way she listens.  Shutterbug heard, she acted, she carried through.
22922/0:He said I should get your help.  Perhaps we all have a common enemy now.
22923/0:We're in this together, Alex, whether we like it or not.  The Sequencing Module should be stored on Saman's private computer.  More when you reach the Luminon's command area.
22924/0:Take me back to downtown Trier.
22925/0:
22926/0:When I merged with Helios in the 2050's, I never dreamed that I would have to wait twenty years for a chance to implement my plans.
22927/0:Thanks...
22928/0:Unifying the world's religions is a difficult enterprise.  What we must do -- and I ask your help in this -- is is determine what happened to Captain Lamar so that we can assess the operation.  Just as you arrived I got a report that he had abandoned his unit.  Incidentally, my agents have been following your activities in Upper Seattle.  We will talk about Mako Ballistics when you return.
22929/0:But don't the locals depend on the factory for jobs?
22930/0:Well, you're the one who wanted to be such a badass.
22931/0:We're probably looking at tightened security soon.
22932/0:
22933/0:For your musical entertainment needs.
22934/0:Splendid.  I will put in a good word.
22935/0:I'd have to think about it.
22936/0:I hope nobody finds out.
22937/0:Her Holiness said that I would be most useful in the medina, comforting our concerned believers.  Perhaps there is an operation planned against the arcology, but I did not inquire.  I trust Her Holiness to take appropriate action.
22938/0:Mmm, what do I see?  An exceptional young man.  Modified, correct?  Lovingly grown in an enclave -- and now you step into the dangerous world.
22939/0:(inhales)  Ahhh, fresh air...
22940/0:Alex, Paul has already joined me inside the Statue.  Before my machine will work, however, we need the Aquinas Protocol specification from a computer on the lower level of UNATCO.  Yes, my machine taps into MJ-12's old network, but this time the network will be a tool for everyone.
22941/0:I'm sorry, the Inclinator is closed until we get this toxic spill cleaned up.
22942/0:Thank you.
22943/0:The lower levels become a ghost town whenever I sing.
22944/0:Wait a minute -- you aren't my pilot.
22945/0:A tissue scan, please.  The biological properties could be used to improve Omar adaptability.  Or would you prefer to make a purchase now?
22946/0:That's the impression I get.
22947/0:Hope you got your money's worth, cuz I'm keeping your winnings, supposing you have some.  House rules.  Try to make a clean bet next time.
22948/0:What are you studying?
22949/0:Now I understand.
22950/0:I hope this means the Director starts taking those cargo checks a bit more seriously.
22951/0:The assumption is that Leila got away.  We never found her body.
22952/0:
22953/0:Would you like to make a purchase?
22954/0:As survivors flee the remains of the city, they wonder how or why this disaster could have happened.
22955/0:Hey, yo, we don't need no feebs tryin' to sabotage the fight.
22956/0:Let's see... minus ten percent.  Here you go.
22957/0:An excellent customer indeed -- you've depleted my inventory.
22958/0:What took so long?  I'm fallin' asleep out here.
22959/0:We have no choice but to stay here.  We don't get to go back inside your atmospheric barriers at the end of the day.
22960/0:What?  More modified scum?  We'll take care of you.
22961/0:The service will be a theft.  In the basement of this establishment the manager has hidden a cadaver.  An unusual mutant he wishes to sell to a biotech firm.  We are interested in the properties of the mutant's tissues, which are highly resistant to radiation and extreme temperature.
22962/0:Everyone signs a non-disclosure agreement when they start.  Did he think we were joking?  
22963/0:I've got you covered.
22964/0:He WAS working it off, then he lost a whole shipment of biocells to a WTO patrol.
22965/0:Perhaps this is the end of our troubles.
22966/0:Too late.  The WTO already has the schematic.  You should have acted more quickly.
22967/0:It has been a pleasure doing so much business with you.
22968/0:No, but the man who interrupted Dr. Nassif mentioned a "Code Yellow" emergency.  Does this sort of thing happen a lot?
22969/0:Well --
22970/0:No new gods.  Got it.
22971/0:Five times?  That's quite an increase.
22972/0:I've got work to do.
22973/0:That's just a xenophobic rumor.
22974/0:I wish there was something I could do.
22975/0:SSC got most of the Panzerwerks rioters under control pretty quickly, breaking up fights and throwing a few people in jail.
22976/0:
22977/0:Thanks for braving that mess.
22978/0:You've been very helpful already.  My computer analyzed the transceiver in your temporal bone and found some interesting data files. 
22979/0:Show me an executive with backbone, and I'll show you an Omar with a personality.
22980/0:Good work.  Our pilots should pick up the signal and be here in no time.
22981/0:Oh -- you the woman with covert ops training?  You want to make my day?  Bring me the balance sheet for that dive nightclub.  VOX.  Down at the end of the block.
22982/0:Don't mention it.
22983/0:We must protect the Illuminati plan at any cost.
22984/0:You will each be interviewed individually in the near future to determine your interests and how they position you within the company.  Please keep in mind how important security has become.  We are looking for assurances that moving you into these new positions is the right thing at this time.
22985/0:
22986/0:Hop in.
22987/0:If you're worried about the terrorist attack, don't be.  WTO security did its job.  The Order Church won't try something like that again.
22988/0:(grunt) Slow down, sir!
22989/0:(grunt) Slow down, miss!
22990/0:I don't blame you for what happened in Cairo.
22991/0:The only guy with the code for the repair bot's closet is trapped on another platform.  We've also got a hazard flush system -- and we've got the code for that one -- 4781 -- but the remote access is damaged.  I'm trying to get one of these fools to go up to the balcony overlooking the bay to hit the master control, but they're afraid of crossing through the spill.
22992/0:Good day.
22992/1:My compliments.
22992/2:We all do what we have to.
22993/0:Leave Dr. Todd to his work.
22994/0:Just wait by the case.  I'll unlock the access panel from my office.
22995/0:Give me the black market biomods. [1700]
22996/0:Sorry.  I guess I blew it.
22997/0:Red alert -- There has been a severe security breach.
22998/0:That guy over there at the table wants to steal one of your paintings.
22999/0:Travel outside arcology walls is discouraged.  Particulate matter levels are severe.  Always wear breathing equipment when you have business in the medina.
23000/0:After this mess, this station is going to get a full review from the WTO.
23001/0:Thanks for sticking around.  What are the chances that you could take me to Cairo?
23002/0:I don't believe you.  I guess we'll just search your corpse.
23003/0:I will have to take your biomod materials by force.
23004/0:Murderer not found.
23004/1:Homicide unresolved.  Archiving evidence.
23005/0:Here you go.  Just be careful -- some of the tenants are a bit more paranoid than others.  Especially 2225.  He's been really tense lately.
23006/0:Assailant not found.
23006/1:Engagement unresolved.  Archiving data.
23007/0:Intruder not found.
23007/1:Intrusion unresolved.  Archiving data.
23008/0:Failure to locate the thief.
23008/1:Thief not found.
23009/0:Scan inconclusive.
23009/1:Threat probability: no foreseeable disturbance.
23009/2:Clear.  Downgrading alert.
23010/0:Target acquired.
23010/1:Engaging.
23011/0:How are our friends at the Order and WTO going to deal with New Cairo?  Hear anything before you left Trier?  I would think they would dispatch a force to retake the city.
23012/0:Destroying lifeform.
23013/0:Queequeg's coffeehops.  Bright, clean... your sanctuary from life's worries.  
23014/0:And you want me to break into the place.
23015/0:Target reacquired.
23015/1:Continuing engagement.
23016/0:Just like her to flaunt her position...
23017/0:So they let the Chicago transfers out of their cages.  You're looking at Leo Jankowski.  You train here now, so I guess you can call me Leo.
23018/0:They think Plague 11 is just another punishment for us being lazy and poor.
23019/0:It doesn't take a genius to see that they all want one thing: to force their system or whatever on the rest of us.  The world is doing just fine without a supreme leader.
23020/0:JC Denton did what the Illuminati asked -- he destroyed Bob Page, the leader of MJ-12.  Don't be tricked into believing that the Helios-JC hybrid is true to JC.  It might have its own agenda, one driven by a well-disguised machine intelligence.
23021/0:Here you go.  [100]
23022/0:I don't have time for your nonsense now!
23023/0:Great, isn't she?
23024/0:So the Illuminati wants to maintain disparity?
23025/0:I hope you stick around Upper Seattle.  I could use the help.
23026/0:So I already got a lead on this epidemic in Old Cairo.  Courtesy of the Omar in the medina, I've got some information about a possible cure.
23027/0:No weaponry detected.
23028/0:The safest option would be to consolidate JC's defences around the Statue.
23029/0:Target occluded.
23029/1:Analyzing evasive tactic.
23030/0:There are some things I like to keep my own counsel about.
23031/0:Target retreating.
23031/1:Clearing enemy position.
23031/2:Response effective.
23032/0:Enemy targeting error.
23032/1:Attack evaded.  Continuing operation.
23032/2:Enemy attacks inaccurate.  Degrading threat assessment.
23033/0:Quit screwing around.
23034/0:Analyzing system damage.
23034/1:Damage sustained.
23034/2:Assessing damage.
23035/0:Severe damage.
23035/1:Danger.  Hull integrity failing.
23035/2:Auxillary circuits engaged.  Reduced survivability. 
23036/0:Unless you have a better idea.
23037/0:Systems failing.
23037/1:Mission jeopardized.
23037/2:Hull plates vulnerable.
23038/0:Extreme heat.  Compensating.
23039/0:Negligible damage.
23039/1:Enemy ineffective.
23039/2:Threat assesment: minor.
23040/0:
23040/1:
23040/2:
23040/3:
23041/0:I just wanted a steady job, not a holy war.
23042/0:You need work, you go to the Pit.  This is what I did.  I found work.  Mercenary.  Black market.  In a few hours, they send me to Egypt.
23043/0:Nah -- they don't mind if you hang out in the chapel, as long as you don't fall asleep.  Man, did I find THAT out the hard way.
23044/0:I back up my brethren.
23044/1:
23044/2:
23044/3:Need a hand with that fool?
23044/4:I'd like to join in.
23044/5:
23044/6:But can you handle both of us?
23045/0:I'm paying for information.
23046/0:They scrip' mine, I scrip' theirs.
23047/0:They never should have messed with us.
23048/0:Too late.  She already gave away the nature of ApostleCorp's secret invention.  You can be sure the WTO won't rest until they have teleportation devices of their own -- and a worldwide monopoly on their manufacture.
23049/0:
23050/0:
23051/0:Well --
23052/0:You kids really are a bunch of brats.  Well, I'm going to do my duty... if only for all the SSC that got taken down today.
23053/0:My interest is in adapting social systems to the facts of human nature.  That principle is the cornerstone of all of my thinking.
23054/0:Targeting accurate.
23054/1:Ranged weapon successful.
23054/2:Target damaged.
23055/0:Threat neutralized.
23055/1:Target eliminated.
23055/2:Successful battle logged for analysis.
23055/3:Countermeasures successful.
23056/0:You should never have jammed those actuators at Panzerwerks and stolen that shipment of welders.  Now you will pay.
23057/0:Targeting.
23057/1:Weapon alignment.
23058/0:Coordinating with additional unit.
23059/0:Summoning additional units.
23060/0:The air's clean in the medina now, and the Templars haven't seized full control there.  That's where we need to go.
23061/0:Summoning medical bot.
23062/0:Summoning repair bot.
23063/0:
23064/0:Unexpected consequence of action.  Reviewing sequence.
23064/1:Negative result.  Altering heuristic.
23065/0:Precisely why I'm hiring you.  You can handle a hostile insertion, right?
23066/0:We'll be outta here in no time.
23067/0:Good idea.
23068/0:
23069/0:Some people build things up -- other people try to tear them down.
23070/0:Oh -- I was hired to clean the system out. The spider bots haven't really been getting the job done.
23071/0:I don't know what I'll finally decide about the WTO, but it's hard to pass up a chance to play a role in such a monumental project.
23072/0:What's available?
23073/0:Pathway blocked.
23074/0:Doorway blocked.
23075/0:
23076/0:Explosive deployed.
23076/1:Launching grenade.
23077/0:Live explosive detected.
23077/1:Alert -- grenade.  Alert -- grenade.
23078/0:You see these radicals in the news -- they want a Crusade against the rest of us.
23079/0:
23080/0:Proximity device detected.
23080/1:Danger -- explosive device.
23081/0:Weapon system performace: poor.
23081/1:Targeting error.
23081/2:Weapon system re-aligned.
23082/0:
23083/0:Termination authorized.
23083/1:Accessing tactical database.
23083/2:Tactic anticipated.
23084/0:Success probable.
23084/1:Mission completion highly probable.
23084/2:Tactics successful.
23084/3:Implementing battle resolution.
23085/0:I'd rather have it now, while you're still in business.  Aren't you worried that the Templars will occupy the medina?
23086/0:Biomods detected.
23086/1:Target employing biomods.
23086/2:Trans-human enemy.  Compensating.
23087/0:Cloaking ineffective against sensors.
23088/0:I just cruised by Flight Bay 23, but the pilot beacon's dead.  You'll need to bring it online before I can land.
23089/0:(laugh)  Won't be keeping me up at night.  Here's your money.
23090/0:I cannot wait to get some fresh air.
23091/0:I guess Her Holiness is finally safe now.
23092/0:I was going to ask you to investigate the Minister of Culture's penthouse in the Emerald Suites, since we think he has been smuggling equipment to ApostleCorp, but the Mako operation is more important.  You should hire a pilot and leave at once.
23093/0:Billie Adams must be destroyed.  If she damages the Helios core, she will destroy JC's mind.
23094/0:You're on the ground.  Good.  Now get inside the main complex.  Expect heavy security around the perimeter, including automated surveillance and armed guards.  Your assignment will be to locate the prototype of the Templar-funded Mag Rail so that my people can upload a schematic.  More later.
23095/0:You have your orders.  Proceed.
23096/0:After I finish with Calculus, I need to spend some time on my Ethics homework.
23097/0:Dr. Nassif would never have told you to come HERE.
23098/0:I really need to be getting back.
23099/0:Enemy moves at trans-human speed.
23100/0:(bleep)
23100/1:(static)
23100/2:(pops)
23101/0:Target assessment: vulnerable.  Proceeding.
23101/1:Attention: your survival probability is low.  You are advised to leave.
23101/2:Calculating mission risk.... negligible.
23101/3:Tactical advantage assured.
23102/0:Never fear.  Dr. Todd has found a non-lethal way to remove your biomods.
23103/0:Target assessment: average.  Proceeding.
23103/1:Difficult combat scenario.  Analyzing...
23103/2:Calculating mission risk.... acceptable.
23103/3:Be advised: opponents in your position who do not flee survive less than fifty percent of their engagements.
23104/0:Target assessment: formidable.  Accessing tactical database. 
23104/1:Calculating mission risk... high.
23104/2:Combat situation poor.  Recalculating.
23104/3:Warning: destruction of security platforms is a serious crime.
23104/4:Mission jeopardized.
23104/5:Enemy survival probability high.
23105/0:Are you really trying to find me a place to live in the arcology?  Don't you want to be able to see each other more often?
23106/0:Shutdown.
23106/1:Critical damage.
23106/2:System failure.
23107/0:I grew up in the enclave -- I guess I'm just terrified of unprotected neighborhoods.
23108/0:Combat support required.
23109/0:
23109/1:
23109/2:
23109/3:
23109/4:
23110/0:Mission accepted.
23110/1:Executing.
23110/2:Fulfilling directive.
23111/0:The Templars are one step ahead of us, but not for long.  Repair the Gate with the Sequencing Module.  Your long-lost older brother is waiting for you on the other side.  I don't care how much you may hate us, you will try to save your brother.  I am certain of that.
23112/0:So you're modified?  You must be the one the Harvester is interested in...
23113/0:Are you crazy?
23114/0:He AIN'T a private.  That was just an example.  He hired all of US, right?  That makes YOU the private.  Now march.
23115/0:Sorry, I --
23116/0:Perhaps you lost someone close to you in the Chicago disaster.  How does it feel?  You going to let it turn you into a killer?
23117/0:Scanning.
23117/1:Processing.
23117/2:Surveyed region clear.
23117/3:Threat probability: negligible.

23120/0:New file opened.  Your actions will be recorded.

23121/0:Interference with security systems is a criminal act.
23121/1:Stay back.

23122/0:Do not linger.
23122/1:Please peacefully pursue your business.

23130/0:I told you before.  Protection.
23131/0:Who has your jet?
23132/0:
23133/0:Panzerwerks -- It's not just a name, it's a commitment -- to security, to safety, and most of all, to the community.  
23134/0:Loyal seeker, your next objective is to help us find Dr. Nassif.  She comes from a poor family in this plague-stricken village.  Billie Adams will be coordinating the investigation from the mosque that lies between the arcology and the village.  Report to her at once.
23135/0:I can't afford the gas grenades now.  Maybe later. [300]
23136/0:That's twice you've sided with ApostleCorp.  Guess you're a lost cause.  If I can't persuade you, I'll have to kill you.  See you shortly.

23141/1:Warning: threat classification has been modified upward.
23141/2:Weapons must remain concealed.  Please observe this policy.
23142/0:Perhaps you're right.  May She forgive my doubt.  I grew up in post-Collapse Hong Kong.  My parents were Max Chen and Maggie Chow, conspirators involved wirh MJ-12.  My worst fear is that I'll give my allegiance to a deceptive cause.  May Order prevail.
23143/0:Assault classified as deliberate.
23143/1:Hull damage.  Subsequent damage may warrant retaliation.
23143/2:Motivation of assailant unclear.  Use of force postponed, pending additional data.

23145/0:I know enough -- You're on assignment from the Templars to "purify" this school, you monster.
23146/0:I remember when this town was full of seagulls.  Now it's a wasteland.  Rubble, vacant buildings, mutants everywhere.  They eat each other, they eat people's pets, they eat bums that fall asleep by the wrong sewer drain -- and I brought children into this world.
23147/0:Final warning.  Battle systems ready.
23147/1:Threat classification: extreme.  Battle systems ready.
23147/2:Protocol requires that perpetrators be warned before force is applied.  This is your warning.

23149/0:Here you go.
23150/0:Engaging the enemy.
23150/1:Threat scheduled for elimination.
23151/0:No, but I've heard from Billie.  She seems to be mixed up with the Order Church.
23152/0:No foolhardy maneuvers.  This isn't a game.
23153/0:You're making your peace by destroying the monsters that invaded your flesh.  Good.
23154/0:
23155/0:Get up, girl!  You all right?
23156/0:Stand deep -- we still got the numbers.
23157/0:He killed him!
23158/0:I just follow the orders.  There's a computer hub down there... some sort of pre-Collapse master server.
23159/0:He killed her!
23160/0:She killed him!
23161/0:She killed her!
23162/0:Stinkin' gob -- you're DEAD!
23163/0:I'll be right there.
23164/0:See.  You can scrip' a hit when you have to.
23164/1:Groovy.  Now it's my turn.
23165/0:You're deadly, girl.
23166/0:You're deadly, bro'.
23167/0:The Order Church is in big trouble if they've given in to the radicals.
23168/0:I'm going to talk to my lawyer about all of this as soon as I get out of here.
23169/0:You can't control your own people?
23170/0:Think you can find your way out?
23171/0:We expect that they just relocated it, since the beacon has to be within a certain range of the hangar bay to be useful.  But we can't get out to search for it, let alone activate it.  We suspect it may be up in the control room since that area is so heavily guarded.  If you can find it and turn it on, the SSC would know to send in a rescue chopper.
23172/0:A concerned citizen.
23173/0:She was a liar and a fake.  And so are you.
23174/0:Retreating.
23174/1:Proceeding to safety.
23175/0:Affirmative.  Enemy nearby.
23175/1:Pursuing directional scan.  High probability of identifying target.
23175/2:Enemy activity verified.  Ready for engagement.
23176/0:Negative.
23176/1:All surveillance heuristics normal.
23176/2:Area secure.
23176/3:No anomalies to report.
23177/0:This is a Special Report from World News.  Coming on the heels of the Chicago disaster, the city of Seattle has been hit by a series of terrorist attacks.
23178/0:Alex -- a familiar face.  Just what I need.
23179/0:Complete your objective.
23180/0:Proceed.
23180/1:Acknowledged.
23181/0:Yes.  The manager was murdered, but the Pequod's corporation will find a way to keep a branch in Cairo.  That is my fate.
23182/0:I think that thief is finally gone.
23183/0:Maybe that thug has fled.  I hope so...
23184/0:I've heard a lot a rumors about where the missing kids really are.
23185/0:Hey, I heard about you.  You're the one who took care of Archer.  My name's Jennifer McAllister -- I was one of the students on his list.  I owe you my life.
23186/0:Panzerwerks refuses to see the light.
23187/0:Phew!  Looks like that killer's moved on...
23188/0:Never fear.  Mr. Denton has nothing more to accomplish here.  The data is safe, and our forces should be on the move.  Be proud, paladins, we're about to make history!
23189/0:I think I saw something...
23190/0:I know I saw something...
23191/0:So this "gateway..."  I can use it to find JC Denton?
23192/0:Got it.
23193/0:I will wait as long as necessary.
23194/0:Yeah, make that scab bleed!
23195/0:Now he sees.  We're killers.
23196/0:Now she sees.  We're killers.
23197/0:I did what you asked.  It looks like Pequod's image is going to get a facelift.
23198/0:... danger... the enemy... very close...
23199/0:From what I saw of Archer's files, the Templars will stop at nothing.
23200/0:And I thought you was a feeb.
23200/1:Yeah, hog the glory.  Whatever.  One of these days you're gonna get yourself killed.
23201/0:Geez!  Be careful!
23202/0:Watch it -- scab can fight.
23203/0:He's on you!
23204/0:She's on you!
23205/0:Oh, no you don't!  Always feebin' out when I'm about to get killed.
23205/1:Get back here!  We gotta hang together as a pack!
23205/2:Save your own ass -- see if I care.
23206/0:Help!
23206/1:Someone get in this!
23206/2:Some kinda crew.  You gonna leave me up here...?
23207/0:A strafing run?
23208/0:Good.  I don't want to have to rescue your jet again.
23209/0:You just cannot trust those Order freaks.
23210/0:Well, they only let me go as far as the storage closet, but for the right price I could give you the code to the front door.
23211/0:You're really JC Denton.  What happened to your brother?
23212/0:A greasel don't grow up wild and not get in fights.  I said this gob is FRESH, understand?  Been huntin' scab winos for years.
23213/0:Anything else?
23214/0:Sometimes my family does not understand my devotion.
23215/0:We cannot hear you clearly and what you plan.
23216/0:Sure, take out the Templars.  [2000]
23217/0:
23217/1:
23217/2:
23218/0:Huh?
23218/1:Eh?
23218/2:Oh?
23219/0:Hey, Cindy's standin' right there.  You wanna trade life stories, let's wait 'til we're airborne, know what I mean?
23220/0:Nur Gewehre has been in my family for three generations.  I have been locking up since I was a boy.
23221/0:Have fun.  
23222/0:I won.  I think you owe me some money.
23223/0:Leave.
23224/0:
23224/1:
23224/2:
23224/3:
23224/4:
23224/5:
23225/0:I'll take both. [800]
23226/0:I've got just as much training as you do, if not more.  Why don't you let me help out?
23227/0:You think you know something.  Fine.  But if you had any idea who I really work for, you wouldn't touch a hair on my head.
23228/0:You should've been here an hour ago.  They let me fire one.
23229/0:(laugh) I think that's enough shop talk.  Go to the infusion lab and upgrade your systems.
23230/0:Your work will not be forgotten.  When millions of Templars march to victory, you and your team will share in our triumph over the impure.
23231/0:I refuse to waste my valuable time speculating.
23232/0:Why aren't you at the Statue with JC?
23233/0:You must know everybody in the club.
23234/0:Why do I get the feeling I'm being used?
23235/0:Miss Withers called me herself.  So.  You prevailed.
23236/0:I've heard a lot a rumors about where the missing kids really are.
23237/0:Uh... yeah...
23238/0:You know -- the zoning rules, licensing procedures, the constant monitoring of markets.  A five-fold price-hike is pretty unusual.
23239/0:Ah, Alex D.  Nice work in the inclinator there.  The WTO appreciates your work to keep the commerce routes open.  And Chief Morgan has had a lot to say about you.
23240/0:Your parents!  Oh, that's terrible.  I'm so sorry.  If I can do anything to make you feel more at home, let me know.
23241/0:The Omar are an application of anagenetic evolution to rapid environmental change.  In solving the problem of survival on a planet disrupted by wars and self-replicating hazards, we have solved other problems.  The specimen you examined was a similar attempt to solve these problems.
23242/0:The QueeQueg's manager lives in Apartment 21 of the Heron's Loft building.  I bet you could find the code to the shop there.  Careful, though, he's always loafing around at home since he doesn't have to do the 24-hour schtick like us.
23243/0:I noticed that you've been doing some work for the WTO Chairman of New Cairo.
23244/0:You want to fly me around... because I'm modified?
23245/0:I'm doing what I can to ease their suffering.
23246/0:Sit tight.  I'll be right back.
23247/0:I just think someone should take over.  There isn't any GOVERNMENT anymore.  Can't even get a decent meal most of the time.
23248/0:Comin'.
23248/1:Already there.
23248/2:I'm on it.
23249/0:Sure thing, bro'.
23250/0:Uh-huh.
23251/0:Sure thing, sis'
23252/0:Well done, Alex D.  I just read in your file that of all the trainees Dr. Nassif picks you as the most likely to support our objectives.  She appears to have been right.
23253/0:... you KNOW it...
23253/1:Uh-huh.  That's right.
23253/2:... always givin' me hell...
23253/3:I can hack it... 
23253/4:This time I'm gettin' PAID.
23253/5:Never was much of a ladies' man...
23253/6:They always have to kick me when I'm down.
23253/7:Dumbest nickname I ever heard...
23253/8:Guess I'll have to sell something.
23253/9:At least I got a good head on my shoulders.
23253/10:Can't even afford a brush to clean my gun...
23254/0:Unifying the world's religions is a difficult enterprise.  What we must do -- and I ask your help in this -- is is determine what happened to Captain Lamar so that we can assess the operation.  Just as you arrived I got a report that he had abandoned his unit.  Incidentally, my agents have been following your activities in Upper Seattle.  We will talk about Mako Ballistics when you return.
23255/0:(sigh)
23255/1:(yawn)
23255/2:(cough)
23255/3:(sneeze)
23256/0:Yeah.  She wasn't exactly thrilled to catch me rifling through her office...
23257/0:Sorry?  Who are you to be sorry?  You kill the parents and now you come to kill the uncle?  Well, the Nassif family is fighting back.  Leila escaped and you won't find her.
23258/0:I need a matter clip.  I'll take it.  [200]
23259/0:Glad you're enjoying yourself.
23260/0:She means that the Order doesn't pull down many enclave feebs.  Plenty of kooks up there, but they're afraid of the old neighborhoods.
23261/0:The Knights Templar have found recruits in strange places.  The enclaves are very concerned about tracking their activities.
23262/0:
23263/0:I'm being punished for being born into a poor family.
23264/0:You're our personal savior.  First you got Mina into the academy, now this.  Next you'll tell me that you're the reason Nanite Swell 11 cleared up.
23265/0:Tell me more about this "posthuman order."
23266/0:You came to Trier looking for a certain ApostleCorp official.  I need you to stay focused on that objective for right now.  If I find out that one of these strikers from Panzerwerks hurt Her Holiness, though, I might have a slightly more dangerous assignment for you.
23267/0:Sometimes I don't know how long I can keep fighting this.  (cough cough)
23268/0:That's one of the batteries.  It's vulnerable to explosives and EMP attacks, or you could hack the security terminal to disable it.
23269/0:Watch where you're goin'.
23269/1:You better not of shoved me on purpose.
23269/2:Gonna have to try harder than that to knock ME down.
23270/0:(grunt) Cut it out!
23271/0:He's just using her for her abilities.  Once she outlives her usefulness, I doubt he'll care what we do with her.
23272/0:Got a problem?
23272/1:Hey.  // greeting
23272/2:Sorry -- I'm not much of a talker.
23272/3:You're crowdin' me.
23273/0:Not cool.  I'm serious.
23273/1:Hey, I saw that.
23273/2:None of that.
23273/3:Hey.  Just be cool.
23273/4:Think you're some kinda operator or what?
23274/0:Quick!  Here come the cops...!  Just kiddin', man.
23274/1:Scab done slipped his chits...
23275/0:In response to:
23276/0:Quick!  Here come the cops...!  Just kiddin', sis'.
23276/1:Scab done slipped her chits...
23277/0:Hang tight.  I'll be right back.
23278/0:Whoa-whoa-whoa... Where YOU goin'?  No scabs beyond this point.
23279/0:Guess you think you got the jump on me.
23279/1:You lookin' for a fight?
23280/0:You got balls, bro'.
23281/0:You got problem, baby?
23282/0:Lieutenant.  Here is the softkey to the storage room at the back of the hangar [Hangar 24].  I need you to remove the Plague 11 files -- the ones related to the cure -- and bring them to me at the VIP overlook in Flight Bay 23.  Meanwhile, here is the key to the suite on 108.  It's time.  Shut ApostleCorp down, but do it quietly. [Attachment received]
23283/0:Pequod's.  They run ads on the public terminal right across the street from my shop, and they don't even have a branch in Trier!
23284/0:I had nothing to do with the attack on this lab.  I'm trying to get to JC myself -- can you tell me anything useful?
23285/0:I just hope we can find a way to salvage this summit and get the two sides talking again.
23286/0:Okay.
23287/0:Everything has a reason.
23288/0:Alex, the WTO and Order are not as they seem...  They are but different faces of the same organization -- the Illuminati, an ancient secret society to which Chad and I are the heirs.  My mother was the Illuminatus Beth DuClare.  The WTO and Order are merely the tools Chad and I are presently using to elevate humanity to the next level.
23289/0:I took care of your enemies.  The leaders of both the Order and the Templars are dead.
23290/0:(moan) Was that... poison?!
23291/0:I can't see!
23292/0:
23293/0:Is that all you've got?
23294/0:Got it.
23295/0:Nooo....
23295/1:It's over...
23296/0:I'm safe... for now.
23297/0:I'm sorry -- I can't help you.  I've been reassigned.
23298/0:(moan)
23298/1:(groan)
23298/2:(grunt)
23299/0:Time to cool it.  Know what I'm sayin'?
23300/0:Oomph.
23300/1:(grunt)
23301/0:Easy on that scrip', bro'.  I got an eye on you.
23302/0:(gasp)
23303/0:Easy on that scrip', girl.  I got an eye on you
23304/0:Hey, yo, you tryin' to start somethin'?
23304/1:You some kinda feeb weirdo?
23304/2:Hey -- you almost tripped me!
23304/3:(grunt) Somethin' wrong with you?
23305/0:I'm just getting warmed up.
23306/0:(grunt) Hey!  Don't think that's gonna scrip' with me. 
23306/1:(grunt) CAREFUL!  JEEZ!
23307/0:You did?  Well, it doesn't matter anyway.  When a unit goes down, a replacement arrives within a couple of hours.  I wouldn't make it ten miles into the desert.  God, you're right, Alex -- what am I going to do?
23308/0:Alex, you understand that my machine taps into MJ-12's old network.  The right thing to do is make this network available, equally, to everyone on the planet.  I hope you will reconsider your allegiance to the maniac who destroyed your childhood home, along with eight million people in the surrounding area.
23309/0:The next one will find it's mark.
23310/0:... tryin' to read that look on your face.  Somethin' about to go down?
23310/1:Quit starin'.
23310/2:What?  WHAT?!
23310/3:Fine.  Stare at me all day if you want.  See if I care.
23311/0:Bad idea.  Know what I'm sayin'?
23311/1:Jackass.
23311/2:Try that again, and you better forget it.
23311/3:That's enough, yo.
23311/4:Who made YOU King of the World?
23312/0:Small-time crooks don't need jet fighters.  Your guards are dead, and you're next.
23313/0:Uh... Well, I'm not too political.
23314/0:Maybe you don't get it.  My turf.  Know what I'm sayin'?
23315/0:Yeah?  YEAH?!  Make your play, gob-bait.
23315/1:You better not set me off.
23316/0:An associate of mine.
23317/0:I've just about had it.
23317/1:Feeb.  Don't make me jacket your fool ass.
23318/0:Sign me up.
23319/0:
23320/0:I have nothing more to say to someone like you.
23321/0:My jet's already on the roof and primed for takoff.  See?  You can always count on Sid Black for a timely extraction.
23322/0:(grunt)
23322/1:(grunt)
23322/2:(grunt)
23323/0:I can't get a clear shot.
23323/1:I lost the target
23324/0:Coward!
23324/1:Come back here!
23325/0:Ha!  You missed!
23326/0:I wonder if they even cared how we did at the training.  Or was it purely a medical test?
23327/0:Looking good, looking good...
23328/0:I'm serious, man.  Better stand down.
23329/0:Threat Code Red -- Respond accordingly.
23330/0:You expect ten billion people to submit to the rule of a software construct?  What if some of them resist?
23331/0:Looks like an even match here.
23332/0:I'm serious, sis'.  Better stand down.
23333/0:I'd put down some money to see NG promote QueeQueg's.  [500 credits.]
23334/0:This is hopeless!
23335/0:I'm about done talkin', yo.  Know what I'm sayin'?
23335/1:Punk.  You think I'm just talkin' hard?
23336/0:The Pit pays.  You spread that around.
23337/0:The facility's under attack -- by who?
23338/0:Here we go...
23339/0:I'll kill you, man.  I'll KILL you.
23340/0:You don't know when to quit.
23341/0:I'll kill you, girl.  I'll KILL you.
23342/0:That's my only reward -- a discount?
23343/0:No problem -- I can deal with this.
23344/0:I'll let it slide this time.  Just turn it down a notch.
23345/0:Can I trust you?
23346/0:We'll take it from here.
23347/0:The human genome is most perfect in its purest form.  It should never be tampered with or polluted.
23348/0:Easy, bro'.  Easy.  You all right?
23349/0:Friend, the time has come to prepare our OWN government.
23350/0:Easy, girl.  Easy.  You all right?
23351/0:Hold on!
23351/1:Gimme some space, yo.  I'm busy.
23352/0:Girl, you're gettin' kinda clingy.
23353/0:Uh... sorry about that.
23353/1:It's not my fault!
23354/0:
23355/0:Hang on, I've got to make some room.
23356/0:All right.  You get one chance.  But next time you're makin' a donation.  I want to get my sick mamma a present.
23357/0:In an uncertain world... Where the rule of law seldom reaches beyond city walls... Where businesses must look after themselves...
23358/0:I heard there was trouble at Tarsus today.
23359/0:"Was?"
23360/0:Chairman Dumier of the WTO here.  I don't think you'll find your ApostleCorp official out sightseeing at the Black Gate ruins, which is where the sewer leads.  That's right, I've been following your progress.  It would be a shame to lose you to a pack of sewer greasels. 
23361/0:I think you're plotting something else.  This is just a ploy.
23362/0:You need a legitimate career in security before someone will give you any real responsibility.
23363/0:Go on.
23364/0:Gotcha!
23364/1:One more like that...
23365/0:I guess I did the right thing...
23365/1:Oh God -- what have I done?
23366/0:We've got an injury over here.
23367/0:You killed them!
23368/0:For a pretty lady like you, the going rate minus twenty percent.  [400 credits.]  But I'm up the swanny until I get those mercs away from my jet.  Maybe you could arrange an accident, know what I mean?  Take out Sak and her two-bit security force.  You look like the type, wiry, steely-eyed -- like this lady bounty hunter I dated once.
23369/0:Hey, you're getting the hang of that!
23370/0:Damn, it won't open!
23371/0:Whatever the Order may say, you're just a mercenary, not a hero.  Killing one scientist isn't going to end this project.  Someone else will just take on the development now, and without the WTO regulation, it will be very easy for them to sell the Mag Rail to the wrong people.  
23372/0:Glad you took care of that.
23373/0:I can't get through!
23373/1:It's in my way!
23374/0:You're running?!
23375/0:(grunt)
23375/1:(grunt) Lemme try THIS...
23376/0:Ain't goin' THAT way...
23377/0:Help!
23378/0:Dedicated in life and death.
23379/0:Right away.
23379/1:I'm on my way.
23380/0:We need another gun!  Be right back!
23380/1:Goin' to get the rest of our crew.
23381/0:Aaaaa!
23381/1:This is beat.
23381/2:Gotta feeb out.  Sorry.
23381/3:On second thought -- see ya later...
23381/4:Damn!  Gonna get myself scrip'ed...
23381/5:Okay okay -- Jeez!
23382/0:Sorry I let you down, man!
23383/0:Sorry I let you down, sis'!
23384/0:Whoa-whoa-whoa -- stop.  Don't think we're alone, know what I mean?
23384/1:Shhhh.  Could be some offbrand listenin' in.
23385/0:No problem.
23386/0:Headmaster Archer,  There have been some strange rumors regarding your conduct toward students.  We are sure this is only idle gossip, but Tarsus must also urge you to police your behavior so that we may remain above reproach or suspicion.
23387/0:I had a run-in with some Templars in the apartment building across from the mosque.  They're history.  Maybe there won't be any raid.
23388/0:Not today, but Chairman Dumier would like to speak with you.  He's in the interrogation room upstairs.  Don't worry -- no one's going to get interrogated.  Just a safety precaution.
23389/0:Look what they did to him.
23390/0:I'm interested in contacting her.  I was told that she stopped here before leaving for Cairo.
23391/0:Tough luck all around.  A draw.  Here's your money back.
23392/0:
23393/0:I can tell when a girl's had some combat training... HAVE TO in my business.
23394/0:Ummm... Let's talk about this when there's no one around.
23395/0:...I wonder...
23395/1:I think I might be coming down with something.
23396/0:Too dangerous!
23396/1:Can't talk now!
23397/0:It was an accident...
23398/0:Then maybe they failed and were dismissed?
23399/0:(sneeze)
23399/1:(grumble)
23399/2:(whistle)
23399/3:(hum)
23400/0:I wanna know where, I wanna know now.
23400/1:Talk.
23401/0:They're just excited about the show the SSC just put on, dragging Headmaster Archer out of here.  Me?  I've got better concentration and focus.
23402/0:Huh?  A rat...
23403/0:See someone come through here?
23404/0:You are certain of this?  Hm.  That would explain why the board's praise about the NG endorsement was so guarded.
23405/0:Hm, stray cat.
23406/0:I'll kill him!  Where'd he go?
23407/0:JC will need the added security.
23408/0:More birds.
23409/0:I'll kill her!  Where'd she go?
23410/0:Explosives!
23411/0:Help me out here.
23412/0:I was attacked.  Seen anyone suspicious?
23413/0:See anybody?
23414/0:I caught some scab sneakin' around.  Where'd he go?
23415/0:Level 107.  Tarsus Academy of Cairo.  Labor entrance to the medina.
23416/0:I caught some scab sneakin' around.  Where'd she go?
23417/0:Level 108.  Access the Church of the Order, Cairo Shard.
23418/0:Huh.  You notice anything?
23418/1:That ain't right -- know what I'm sayin'?
23419/0:I've seen terrorist groups before.  They lay out a lot of money for weapons, but they don't have any depth.  The run out of food, ammo, morale... then poof! -- they're gone.
23420/0:Level 109.  Pequod's coffeeshop.  Office suites.
23421/0:Hey, you see what that was?
23422/0:What do I get if I bring you his head?
23423/0:
23424/0:Terrorist!  Go!
23425/0:
23426/0:First the trouble here with that helicopter and then I heard there was trouble at the Inclinator.
23427/0:I don't understand...  What's happening?!
23428/0:Her Holiness has been corrupted by politics.  Perhaps now she will learn.
23429/0:Well, it's my daughter, Mina.  Look at her!
23430/0:The directors of this facility are either dead or captured.  JC was never one of them, but I don't know who was running this lab. There wasn't much communication between the different cells.  
23431/0:
23431/1:
23431/2:
23432/0:... processing decentralized... unable... unable...
23433/0:Some monster attacked me, and now I've got to find it -- seen anything?
23434/0:Seen anything suspicious?
23435/0:I'm on someone's trail -- seen anyone?
23436/0:Strange.  Any ideas?
23437/0:Level 110.  Air Terminal Concourse -- Flight Bays 23 and 24.
23438/0:Check around over there.
23438/1:Take a look over that way.
23438/2:I think something's going on over there.
23439/0:Level 111.  Penthouse Suites -- residents and guests only, please.
23440/0:If that nanoformer was up, we'd be fine.  
23441/0:Nope.
23441/1:Haven't noticed a thing.
23441/2:Nothing unusual here.
23442/0:How's it going?
23442/1:How are you?
23443/0:My priorities are survival and infiltration at any cost.  Enough talk.  I am here to assist.
23444/0:Hi.
23444/1:Hey there.
23445/0:Doesn't this stuff with the Order just burn you up?
23445/1:Wanna get together later?
23446/0:What happened?  How did the Templars manage to take the arcology?
23447/0:Don't think so.
23447/1:Try someone else.
23448/0:Upon the arrival of the key, JC was to be awakened, to welcome the perfected genetic code.  Then he and Paul were to share it with the world. Now, there is much unexpected violence, but we will proceed according to the original Plan. 
23449/0:Oh -- is that a biomod canister?  Thanks.
23450/0:Instruction set decoded.   Integrating unfamiliar components.  Yes, continue.  Four others.
23451/0:The grades just came out for the biochem and intuition classes.  Some kids aren't thrilled about it.
23452/0:Excellent.  Will aid Illuminati.  Very wise, indeed.
23453/0:Your rescue of Paul Denton has prevented us from testing the procedure, however.  My people don't trust you, so expect resistance from my paladins until you prove yourself.  It would be foolish of us to take your word for anything.
23454/0:Sorry...
23455/0:
23456/0:The critics start singing a different tune as soon as they get a chance to live in an enclave.
23457/0:If we don't find the mods, they could end up installed in almost anyone.  We've got to track that garbage down and destroy it.
23458/0:Here you go.  Name's Alex D.  [100 credits.]
23459/0:What if I'd rather work alone?
23460/0:Good advice.  The important thing is to protect the interface to Helios and the Aquinas Network.
23461/0:What's your problem?
23461/1:Sheesh.
23462/0:I've had enough.
23462/1:I don't need any more of this today.
23463/0:I don't have time for this.
23463/1:Take your nonsense somewhere else.
23464/0:Hey -- watch where you're going.
23464/1:You bumped me!  Back off.
23465/0:Ouch!  Not funny.
23465/1:You're not making any new friends.
23466/0:Stop looking at me like that.
23466/1:We haven't met, now stop looking at me.
23467/0:I can hear Ophelia calling to you.
23468/0:Stop acting like a freak.
23468/1:You're behaving like a fool.
23469/0:I don't think you're ready to back up that threat.
23469/1:No need to get hostile.
23470/0:There's just something wrong with that whole damn machine....
23471/0:I don't think you're permitted in this area.
23471/1:No trespassing.
23472/0:Really, that's enough.
23472/1:C'mon, I don't need this today.
23473/0:I'm as good as dead.  Either I go to jail, or I wait around for the Omar to find me.
23474/0:I'm not sayin' it twice.
23475/0:I don't understand...  What's happening?!
23476/0:If anything happens to my daughter, you're going to pay.  I mean it.
23477/0:I will wait here for now.  After you find Paul, I will meet you in Flight Bay 23 at the top of the arcology.  Good luck.
23478/0:It sounds like the missionaries to the enclaves will get to live there.  My family would like that.
23479/0:This should be over fast.
23479/1:You do see this suit, right?
23479/2:Bow before Sidon.
23479/3:You will fall.
23479/4:You're no match for a Templar.
23480/0:Then you're cleared to pass.
23481/0:Maybe it IS a judgment on us...
23482/0:They're searching for data that will let them restore the pre-Collapse communications grid.
23483/0:Enough with this jostling.
23483/1:You're really trying my patience with this.
23484/0:What is your problem?  That hurt.
23484/1:I'm not here for target practice.
23485/0:Not so fast...
23485/1:Too late.  Now I'm mad.
23486/0:I really don't enjoy this attention.
23486/1:Don't forget to blink.
23487/0:Not so fast...
23487/1:Too late.  Now I'm mad.
23488/0:Maybe you should go rest.  You're acting a bit odd.
23488/1:Is this an act?  Or are you just out of your head?
23489/0:That way!
23489/1:I hope we're not gonna let the weasel get away...
23490/0:All I want is to understand what happened -- the kidnapping, Saman leaving the Church, a Templar army...
23491/0:You're not intimidating me, just aggravating me.
23491/1:I think you should reconsider that course of action.
23492/0:That way!
23492/1:I hope we're not gonna let the weasel get away...
23493/0:I thought I was clear.  This is a restricted area.
23493/1:Move along already.
23494/0:The assailant's pulling back.
23495/0:I've just about hit my limit.
23495/1:I only have so much patience.
23496/0:You are about to cross the line. 
23496/1:This is it.  Don't push me any further.
23497/0:That's excellent news!  Apparently you didn't need it to finish the job, but you may as well take this biomod canister.  Hurry on and help JC complete his work.
23498/0:
23499/0:Lucky for you, I've got a lot of patience.
23499/1:Glad you came to your senses before I had to teach you a lesson.
23500/0:I'm not kidding about an attack.  I saw a guard die in an explosion.
23501/0:I have failed to locate my passenger.  Where do you want to go?
23502/0:
23503/0:Anyway...
23504/0:And the air keeps getting worse.  If the Templars don't get us, Plague 11 will.
23505/0:You'll be doing everybody a favor by taking that thing out.
23506/0:Just take a look outside.  It's nanite dust these people breathe -- from Nanite Swell 11.  Particles like little insects -- unaffected by the wind.  Probably a leak from a pre-Collapse laboratory that's been forgotten for two decades.
23507/0:Yeah, I'm working for the WTO.
23508/0:Mr. O'Rourke will see you.
23509/0:
23510/0:The assailant's pulling back.
23511/0:Follow it!
23512/0:
23512/1:
23512/2:
23512/3:
23513/0:Follow it!
23514/0:They'd want us to follow her, I guess.
23514/1:She's getting away!
23515/0:Hey... My girlfriend's on her way over here.  This might look a little funny.  Know what I mean?
23516/0:I'm on my way for help.
23517/0:They'd want us to follow her, I guess.
23517/1:She's getting away!
23518/0:The WTO?  Chief Morgan seems pretty intent on recruiting us.
23519/0:That's enough.  I'm leaving.
23520/0:They'd want us to follow him, I guess.
23520/1:He's getting away!
23521/0:No?
23522/0:Encounter probable.
23522/1:Threat probability: medium.
23523/0:They'd want us to follow him, I guess.
23523/1:He's getting away!
23524/0:Close call...
23524/1:Whu--u-u-u-h...
23524/2:... saw that one coming...
23525/0:We are locked in a death-struggle with Pequod's.  Only one chain will survive the decade.
23526/0:Sonic anomaly identified.
23527/0:Close call...
23527/1:Whu--u-u-u-h...
23527/2:... saw that one coming...
23528/0:Understood.  Business is business, right?
23529/0:Warning: restricted area.
23530/0:You're getting yourself in a lot of trouble!
23530/1:Heh....  My turn!
23531/0:Threat detected.
23531/1:High alert.
23532/0:The intellectual property has been secured.  It will be analyzed by our experts.  Well done.  Your pilot will be waiting for you on the roof.
23533/0:Unauthorized organic.
23534/0:Threat probability: high.
23535/0:Paid for by the Order Church.  See the church in your area for details.
23536/0:Unknown threat!
23536/1:Surveillance failure.  Taking emergency measures.
23537/0:Oh, sure.  I'll wait for my own people, thanks.  I don't want to get myself SHOT.
23538/0:You stay here.  I'll take care of it.
23539/0:At this hour, it's either The Greasel Pit bar or the Order Church, depending on your interests.
23540/0:Mr. Kurczec's delays are costing me money.
23541/0:A risky one.  With a big salary.
23542/0:Safe at last.
23543/0:Take it easy.
23544/0:Enough interruptions!
23545/0:I'm supposed to make you like me.  You like it when I argue.
23546/0:You're getting yourself in a lot of trouble!
23546/1:Heh....  My turn!
23547/0:Hey!  This is just my job, man!
23548/0:Hey!  This is just my job, man!
23549/0:Hey!  This is just my job, lady!
23550/0:You get tired of talkin' to the same idiots day after day.
23551/0:Unseen enemy.
23552/0:Hey!  This is just my job, lady!
23553/0:Analyzing collision...
23554/0:I might be in trouble over here!
23555/0:They'll be watching to see how we handle ourselves.
23556/0:Phenomenon unfamiliar.  More analysis required.
23557/0:I might be in trouble over here!
23558/0:Enemy tactic identified.
23559/0:Some kind of biomod, I guess...  // worried
23559/1:Never seen anything like that before.
23560/0:Some kind of biomod, I guess...  // worried
23560/1:Never seen anything like that before.
23561/0:
23562/0:Sounds ignored.  Possible deception.
23563/0:This guy's modified!
23564/0:Animal behavior unusual.
23565/0:Logging animal corpse.
23566/0:We appreciate your resourcefulness in seeking us out, as well as your warnings via our friend Leo regarding the Templar raid.  
23567/0:Analyzing weapon markings.
23568/0:Investigating device malfunction.
23569/0:
23570/0:Yes -- and one of our best captains, too.  The Templars appear to be assembling an army of mercenaries -- and maybe those stories about Parisian gold are true.  They seem to have very deep pockets.
23571/0:JC will be wondering where I am.
23572/0:This guy's modified!
23573/0:Oh.  Well.... You never showed up, so I sold them.  Sorry.
23574/0:
23574/1:
23574/2:
23574/3:
23574/4:
23575/0:This chick's modified!
23576/0:This chick's modified!
23577/0:Oh, Jeez -- some sort of cloaking device!
23578/0:Investigating disabled device.
23579/0:Oh, Jeez -- some sort of cloaking device!
23580/0:Investigating moving object.
23581/0:Watch out.  The sneak's invisible.
23582/0:Investigating missing object.
23583/0:Watch out.  The sneak's invisible.
23584/0:What's the word?  Looks like Tina put the Claw in the chute instead of Gob-zilla.  (laugh)
23585/0:Investigating displaced object.
23586/0:So you've got some sort of shield against explosives, huh?
23587/0:Investigating damaged object.
23588/0:So you've got some sort of shield against explosives, huh?
23589/0:Investigating destroyed object.
23590/0:Jeez -- a skull gun!
23591/0:Investigating open door.
23592/0:Go away!
23593/0:Investigating closed door.
23594/0:Investigating active light source.
23595/0:Investigating inactive light source.
23596/0:Pleased to meet you, too.
23597/0:The WTO, Tarsus, or any other corporate entity seeks only to exploit you.  As far as Tarsus is concerned, we're experiments, not people -- just walking petri dishes.  You know we're worth more than that.
23598/0:
23599/0:Sorry, I'm not your exterminator.  What's going on?
23600/0:What brings the German Luminon to Cairo?
23601/0:Thanks, miss.
23602/0:
23603/0:I've had enough of Seattle for a while, especially with all the commotion today.
23604/0:After this mess, this station is going to get a full review from the WTO.
23605/0:You're on the ground.  Good.  Now get inside the main complex.  Expect heavy security around the perimeter, including automated surveillance and armed guards.  Your assignment will be to locate the prototype of the Templar-funded Mag Rail so that my people can upload a schematic.  More later.
23606/0:Jeez -- a skull gun!
23607/0:It's a gun barrel... in his forehead!
23608/0:It's a gun barrel... in his forehead!
23609/0:Everything leading up to this, all the work and sacrifice, has been well worth it.
23610/0:It's a gun barrel... in her forehead!
23611/0:What a strange day.  All this commotion at the terminal.
23612/0:It's a gun barrel... in her forehead!
23613/0:Hush up.  Talk about gettin' us FIRED...
23614/0:Wow -- pretty freakish sprinting ability.
23615/0:There were stories about sacrifices... I do not believe those, but Seekers are definitely strange.
23616/0:
23617/0:Wow -- pretty freakish sprinting ability.
23618/0:After another batch of excellent progress reports, I am pleased to announce that we are nearing the closing of this phase of our field operations, slightly ahead of schedule.  We will be in contact soon with your new orders.  
23619/0:Must be disrupting sensors...  The bots'll have a hard time with this one.
23620/0:Must be disrupting sensors...  The bots'll have a hard time with this one.
23621/0:(grunt)
23621/1:(grunt)
23621/2:(grunt)  ... got hit...  // surprise
23621/3:(grunt) Damn...
23622/0:I'm the security chief for this facility.  We were alerted to your presence shortly after your arrival in Cairo.
23623/0:It...is...over...
23624/0:
23625/0:
23625/1:
23626/0:I'm the one with a perfect special-ops rating.  They didn't tell you this?  Why would they keep it a secret?
23627/0:The client demands flawless security.  Shut the place down.
23628/0:I would not sell to the Omar, but they have taken control of the distribution channels.
23629/0:This toxic spill in the Inclinator has shut down operations.  The area's been closed off and they've deployed bots to patrol and secure it.  The WTO is reaping the benefits of its harmful industries -- I guess a little pollution is all in a day's work up there.  May Her Holiness watch over you as you try to face these obstacles.
23630/0:Lockdown lifted.  Normal operations resuming.
23631/0:The biotech team will be meeting in one hour.  Remember to bring your rebreathers.
23632/0:Tough break about Chicago.  I guess you knew people there.
23633/0:Do you need a pilot?  My helicopter is on the landing pad in the town outside the arcology.  Here's a photo so you can spot me quickly.
23634/0:Lots of people, coming and going.
23635/0:What's the matter?  Scared?

23636/3:(grunt) Damn...
23637/0:(grunt) Bastard...
23638/0:Building manager.  I need to check the pipes.
23639/0:(grunt) Bastard...
23640/0:(grunt) Damn you, lady...
23641/0:(grunt) Damn you, lady...
23642/0:(grunt) Whaddaya want?!  // panicked
23642/1:(grunt) You gonna kill me over this?  HUH?
23643/0:(grunt) Whaddaya want?!  // panicked
23643/1:(grunt) You gonna kill me over this?  HUH?
23644/0:(grunt) Damn gob...
23644/1:(scream)
23645/0:(grunt) Damn gob...
23645/1:(scream)
23646/0:(grunt) I'm wounded!
23646/1:(grunt) I can make it...
23647/0:Tell me about the young woman.
23648/0:When JC arrived so many years ago, and the Versalife base fell silent, he took care of us.  In return, we would maintain his habitat while he slept, and await Apostlecorp's masterpiece.  Paul was to accompany the key, but instead two keys have arrived, and Paul remains nowhere.
23649/0:
23650/0:
23651/0:Oh.... Sorry, mate.  Just talkin' chuff.  No offense.
23652/0:Heed my warning, tool.
23653/0:I found out quite a bit about the Tarsus experiments.
23654/0:More meat for the chop shop....
23655/0:Give me the biomod. [500]
23656/0:I'm not showin' you my foot.
23657/0:Alex, this is Ava Johnson.  I'm a pilot, and I've been sent to pick you up.  The signal from the beacon will let me land near the VersaLife facility, but first you must speak to JC.  I will circle the area until it's time to land.
23658/0:Everyone loses their way at some point -- we just want to help people find the way back.
23659/0:Oh come off it!  I know your secret and I'm not going to let you get away with this.
23660/0:(grunt) I'm wounded!
23660/1:(grunt) I can make it...
23661/0:(grunt) Draw him off!
23662/0:No one has yet claimed responsibility for the attack on Chicago.  We don't know with any certainty whether it was an accident, an ideological strike against the WTO enclave there, or something else.  Fortunately, we were able to evacuate the trainees there.  They will be joining us at this location and you will be meeting them shortly.  We appreciate your patience during this stressful period.
23663/0:(grunt) Draw him off!
23664/0:(grunt) Draw her off!
23665/0:(grunt) Draw her off!
23666/0:He has a secret office in the back where you'll find all the evidence.  The students who've been targetted have gone into hiding.  If you can find them, they'll also be able to corroborate the story.
23667/0:(scream) Get it off!  Get it off!
23668/0:(scream) Get it off!  Get it off!
23669/0:Aagh!
23669/1:(grunt) Oh, Lord...
23669/2:(defiant growl)
23669/3:(grunt) That's it!
23670/0:You better move.  This is the real thing.
23671/0:Aagh!
23671/1:(grunt) Oh, Lord...
23671/2:(defiant growl)
23671/3:(grunt) That's it!
23672/0:The technology's uses exceed what you might expect.  It could standardize the human organism, make all ability and talent into software modules, radically disrupt the social order...
23673/0:Yes.  We have saved you so that you can help us identify and defeat your creators.  Please listen to my High Augur, Lin May Chen.
23674/0:(grunt) I'm hurt pretty bad.
23674/1:(grunt) Help me out, why don't ya?!  // exasperated
23675/0:As if school isn't already stressful enough.
23676/0:I engineered the mesh armor in the walls of your cells.  You look fantastic -- this is the first time I've seen my design in a live patient.
23677/0:Don't be naive.  Search Nassif's apartment.  Then go to the Order headquarters in the old Hartford Turbine warehouse in Lower Seattle.  It will all become clear to you.
23678/0:I took care of the zoning.
23679/0:Doctor... Doctor!  We have a Code Yellow.
23680/0:I feel so helpless standing here, waiting to be gunned down by some fanatic.
23681/0:The sooner the better, if you ask me.  I'll catch up to you once you're in position.
23682/0:Let's see... times four, minus ten percent.  Here you go.
23683/0:
23684/0:You better come clean.  If we find out that you profited from the black market, I won't need a warrant to put you on the floor beside your club-hopping VIP.
23685/0:I've already been there.  I'm pretty sure I killed that guy.
23686/0:I can't help but feel like my every move is being watched.  I must just be getting paranoid...
23687/0:(grunt) I'm hurt pretty bad.
23687/1:(grunt) Help me out, why don't ya?!  // exasperated
23688/0:I don't think you understand how serious the situation is.
23689/0:(moan)
23689/1:(moan)
23689/2:(moan) Oh, God...
23689/3:(moan) Then KILL me.  Do it!  // weepy
23690/0:(moan)
23690/1:(moan)
23690/2:(moan) Oh, God...
23690/3:(moan) Then KILL me.  Do it!  // weepy
23691/0:(groan) Don't kill me!
23691/1:(groan) You satisfied?
23691/2:(groan) I'm a human being, for chrissake!
23692/0:(groan) Don't kill me!
23692/1:(groan) You satisfied?
23692/2:(groan) I'm a human being, for chrissake!
23693/0:All of the best ones.  It's a shame you won't live to experience true understanding.
23694/0:(groan) Scat!  SCAT, you freak!   // desperate
23695/0:It's been ages since I had a real party...
23696/0:(groan) Scat!  SCAT, you freak!   // desperate
23697/0:If you've got a multitool, you might try hacking the control panel next to the beams.  Or -- or something else that might work -- just blow the whole thing up with a grenade.
23698/0:If they won't smuggle us out of the country, I say we do it ourselves.
23699/0:(groan) Just save yourself...
23699/1:(groan) Get me out of here!
23700/0:(groan) Just save yourself...
23700/1:(groan) Get me out of here!
23701/0:Business is business.
23702/0:Aaaa!
23702/1:Acid!
23703/0:Alex -- a familiar face.  Just what I need.  Sorry I attacked you before.  Just doing my job.
23704/0:Hi.  I'm NG Resonance.  I depend on my singing voice.  That's why I drink Pequod's coffee.  Nanoscale scrub-bots are brewed right into every serving, so the sensitive tissues in your throat are stengthened and repaired with every swallow.  Pretty cool, huh?  Not to mention the edge it gives me before a big show.  I don't know what I'd do without my Pequod's.
23705/0:
23705/1:
23705/2:
23705/3:
23705/4:
23706/0:That's right, you arrived and you're still there.  I saw you myself -- the real NG Resonance -- then I took a shot at knocking you off your pedestal.  In real life, you're a spoiled brat.  Did you know that?
23707/0:
23707/1:
23707/2:
23707/3:
23708/0:Seriously -- how was it?  Smooth ride?
23709/0:Speak with the trader if you wish to transact.
23710/0:I would, I WOULD, but what would happen to him if I got the plague?  No, I can't.
23711/0:On a stage near the Pequod's coffeeshop.  I put you down for a free ticket -- remember?  That'll be SO COOL if you come!
23712/0:The thing about a greasel fight, it has more to do with upbringing than breeding.  A greasel's a greasel.
23713/0:I could use the firepower of an SMG, but I'm short on cash.  [400]
23714/0:Aaaa!
23714/1:Acid!
23715/0:(scream)
23715/1:(scream)  Water... Water!
23716/0:(scream)
23716/1:(scream)  Water... Water!
23717/0:Be careful -- they control the whole facility.
23718/0:I can't see!
23718/1:My eyes!
23719/0:I can't see!
23719/1:My eyes!
23720/0:Nice try.
23720/1:Ha!  Barely scratched me.
23720/2:Close one!
23721/0:Nice try.
23721/1:Ha!  Barely scratched me.
23721/2:Close one!
23722/0:Sure, take out the Templars.  [250]
23723/0:Uh!
23723/1:(grunt)
23724/0:Uh!
23724/1:(grunt)
23725/0:Yes.  I'm trying to get access to this hangar to see if it might explain these figures...and failing miserably.  Whoever said the WTO has perfected bureaucracy has obviously never dealt with the Templars.
23726/0:(moan)
23726/1:(moan)
23726/2:(moan)
23727/0:Thanks.
23728/0:Here you go.  [100]
23729/0:
23730/0:I don't.... understand.
23731/0:You can force your way in by breaking a window, but see the red border?  The glass is alarmed and could attract attention.  If you have a multitool, you could quietly hack the door's keypad instead.
23732/0:If you want to know what I think, I think it's another cult, like the Order.
23733/0:What am I supposed to do?
23734/0:I think we should just rush them, but the captain won't give the order.
23735/0:Miss Sak thanks you.
23736/0:(moan)
23736/1:(moan)
23736/2:(moan)
23737/0:(moan) No!
23737/1:(moan) Why?  I'm just a guard...
23738/0:I don't need a Mag Rail to complete my mission, which is to assassinate its creator.
23739/0:(moan) No!
23739/1:(moan) Why?  I'm just a guard...
23740/0:(gasp)
23741/0:(gasp)
23742/0:I'd like to hear you explain how a city chairman can turn his back on thousands of people living on his city's doorstep.
23743/0:(moan)
23744/0:His vision isn't easy to comprehend because he's operating on a higher level now.  We just have to trust his wisdom, and soon we'll all share in it.
23745/0:Have it your way.
23745/1:I'm ready...
23745/2:I'll do what I've got to do.
23745/3:I'm gonna get a big bonus for this...
23746/0:
23747/0:Have it your way.
23747/1:I'm ready...
23747/2:I'll do what I've got to do.
23747/3:I'm gonna get a big bonus for this...
23748/0:I TOLD 'em they should lock this place down.
23749/0:It's all the same to me, jerk.
23750/0:Our corporate sponsors do most of the junior-level applications work.  My contribution -- minor as it may be -- was to the chromatin-synthesis module in the core architecture.
23751/0:High Augur Chen said you were in charge of handling the epidemic.
23752/0:It's all the same to me, jerk.
23753/0:It's all the same to me, lady.
23754/0:I'd like to get back to work.
23755/0:My new boss -- we call him Mr. Paladin.  He made me a Knight.
23756/0:I'm getting sick of doing all this damage control...  
23757/0:They're just protectin' their turf.  Doesn't bother me.
23758/0:Yes -- everything -- my kidnapping, the disabling of the gate...  He's taken a critical component from it, the Sequencing Module, to the Order Church in Rauchstadt, where his group is headquartered.  Once you get that module from him, you'll be able to use the gate.
23759/0:An interesting discovery.  So Dr. Nassif has a cousin at the Tarsus Academy in New Cairo.  That would have been very useful information, but we already know that the secret ApostleCorp facility is on level 108 of the arcology.  You can still use the visitation pass to enter the school on Level 107, though, if you're curious.
23760/0:
23760/1:
23760/2:
23760/3:
23760/4:
23760/5:
23761/0:I'm glad I could help.
23762/0:
23763/0:That's arson.
23764/0:Chairman Ubair maintains his innocence, but has already retained attorneys for the case.  He will not reveal any specifics about the case nor respond to the accusations, other than to say he has "never failed to honestly serve the citizens of Cairo." 
23765/0:The point is that governmental units need not be territorial.  The proof is all around us.  After the Collapse, communication grids came back up before industry, so what has evolved are many global associations incapable of seizing very much territory.
23766/0:I thought you were going to pillage the biomod laboratory....  You may as well double back and get the infusions, since we're going to have to cut you loose for a while.  I'll give you the code to the elevator when you're done.
23767/0:There are no more Nassifs in Cairo.  They've all been terminated.
23768/0:Risks that might jeopardize your mission, I presume.
23769/0:He got exactly what he deserved.
23770/0:I tried to sign up, but they said they didn't need me.
23771/0:Helios is ready.  Think of it -- billions of perfect beings in instant communication with each other.  We're going to change what it means to be a human being.
23772/0:We're still investigating.  I haven't heard from Captain Lamar since he disobeyed my orders.
23773/0:Thanks.  I guess I should meet our "hostess" here already.  Not much else I CAN do and maybe I can get some better answers in person.  You coming?
23774/0:The Order opened my eyes and saved me from the wicked consumerism that was unbalancing my life.
23775/0:Okay, I'll shut up.  I'm sure you have your own worries.
23776/0:Hold your fire!  I want to hear what you have to say for yourself.
23777/0:
23778/0:I just came from Upper Seattle.  How'd you get this call past WTO security?
23779/0:Right, then.  Meet me at the pad?
23780/0:Is ApostleCorp really such a serious threat that it's a concern to the Director of the WTO?
23781/0:Find your way home.
23782/0:I'm still confused about why we were created.  Maybe you'll find out something in Antarctica.
23783/0:They use some sort of image-matching.  If you're not in the database, BLAM!!!
23784/0:The Tarsus Academy on Level 107 will be accepting new applications starting next month.  The Arcology Chairman promises more city funding which means more opportunity for all.
23785/0:Is that what you do?  Go from city to city looking for one person?
23786/0:Now prove your sincerity.  Give my scientists what they need.
23787/0:
23788/0:Then who is in the apartment upstairs?  Not you?  A neighbor told me she saw Templars, and I received a threatening vmail from a man I used to know like a brother -- now he parades down the street in his robe, goes with a mob into the arcology, and threatens my life!
23789/0:It's okay, Chief Morgan, we can tell him the truth.
23790/0:I met him in Paris once, a long time ago.  He helped me against MJ-12.
23791/0:Just like I was at Tarsus.
23792/0:What's wrong?
23793/0:You better get indoors.
23794/0:Don't worry about me -- I'll be there when you need me.
23795/0:Easy -- I already took care of the Omar.  I was just messing with you.
23796/0:We also suspect that there are a few bots gone haywire inside.  
23797/0:Excellent.  You're in.  I didn't even know that access-point existed.
23798/0:Didn't you get the message when I rescued Paul?  If I bring the system up, it won't be for the Templars.
23799/0:My poor Eeva!  I knew that man couldn't be trusted.  Something's happened -- I know it!
23800/0:Sterling.
23801/0:I know a little something about this "plague."  If you go outside, try to breathe through your nose.
23802/0:I trust the Grand Master's vision, but not you.
23803/0:Time again for a.... ta-a-alk BULLET!
23804/0:
23805/0:I guess we're playing dirty pool, but the market would tank if particulate-laden food ever found distribution.
23806/0:Thirty-five wins, twenty-two titles... I guess that's not a bad legacy for a fighter like 'Zilla.  Sure thought she had more years left in her, though.
23807/0:There is no doubt now.  You are the complete solution, Alex.  The Helios core -- and the parts of JC's mind locked inside it -- have nearly recovered.
23808/0:Guess we have a new champion trainer.  If you ask me, something dirty went down tonight.  That's why Gob-zilla didn't show.
23809/0:
23810/0:Is there anything else you need?
23811/0:Intruder is armed and modified.  Approach with caution.
23812/0:Wisdom must first be human.  You must start with what a human sees and feels.  But wisdom must also be knowledgeable, logical, and fair to billions of other beings.
23813/0:Live from Cairo, Egypt, where the arcology has been taken by a small military group called the Knights Templar.
23814/0:You'd sell your influence for a cup of coffee?
23815/0:I am merely an impartial representative of Club Vox.
23816/0:I don't deal with recruitment.
23817/0:Hey, I heard about you.  You're the one who took care of Archer.  My name's Jennifer McAllister -- I was one of the students on his list.  I owe you my life.
23818/0:Anything else?
23819/0:You may pass.
23820/0:Is it freedom when one child is born to poverty, a chance combination of organic materials, while the wealthy child is shaped every day of his life, enhanced genetically, trained, educated, often augmented nanotechnologically?
23821/0:However, no plans have been made for a summit meeting.  We are reviewing the Director's proposal and considering how to respond.
23822/0:The Illuminati have always sought just one thing -- centralization.  Centralization of wealth, power, and ideology.  The implementation details are unimportant.
23823/0:I understand.
23824/0:We have had much luck spreading Her Holiness's word here in Lower Seattle.
23825/0:I doubt it.  They'd have made an announcement.
23826/0:You may pass, but only because Grand Master orders it.
23827/0:It's your assignment.  Figure it out.
23828/0:Yeah.  She wasn't exactly thrilled to catch me rifling through her office...
23829/0:
23830/0:We appreciate your resourcefulness in seeking us out.
23831/0:I guess you pulled it off.
23832/0:More reports of catastrophe in Seattle.  A toxic spill closed the Inclinator bay.  It is not known at this time whether the event was accidental or part of some greater plan.
23833/0:Saman, everything's going according to plan.  Preliminary tests indicate that the gate should transport me to JC's hideout.  We've also isolated a keystone piece that will easily disable the gate without permanently damaging it.  I'll be making the jump myself shortly, after which a detail of guards will be dispatched with the sequencing module to your compound.
23834/0:I would love to be your chamber-boy.
23835/0:Yes.  My enemies seek to establish States, but they forget to heed Plato's good advice -- do not fail to convince the children that the gods are incapable of lying.  But the children's eyes are open.  Are you ready to exorcise the second souls of modified humans, young paladin?
23836/0:I have decided.  I will be one of these missionaries.
23837/0:He's always leaving me.
23838/0:
23839/0:This is a LABORATORY, let me remind you.
23840/0:
23841/0:You wouldn't dare.
23842/0:That's one of the subjects.
23843/0:The Omar are safe.  Thanks for the tip.
23844/0:
23845/0:I do not understand why you insist on following the WTO's greed and self-interest.  Think about all the people that will be endangered now that they have the schematics for this weapon.  May Her Holiness help you find a way out of the WTO's snare.
23846/0:You watch these people in their homes?
23847/0:Come back later tonight.  Tina's bringin' in the champ -- Gob-zilla.  It's gonna be Gob-zilla versus Snake-eyes.  4-to-1 odds.  Bet on Snake-eyes, you might just quadruple your money.
23848/0:EMP grenades are useful, but I don't have the credits. [400]
23849/0:He, too, is helpless and in need of our new systems.  We thought we had the infusions perfected three years ago, but his body rejected them, violently.  He had to be cryogenically frozen until we could finish the design.
23850/0:No, we just can't guarantee anyone's safety.  They put me out here until the director of the facility finds someone to clean up the mess.
23851/0:I want to finish off Paul Denton.
23852/0:I heard you talking about Dr. Nassif.
23853/0:Good luck.
23854/0:That old base really creeps me out.  I don't even want to think about what kind of experiments they were doing there.  I know they weren't limiting themselves to the DNA of lower species.
23855/0:This chick wants to talk to you about Sid.
23856/0:I don't have the credits for the scrambler grenades. [300]
23857/0:Thank you for believing us.  We tried to tell people, but they just thought it was a prank.
23858/0:I could tell them myself.  They would think it was the same old story: the Illuminati secretly controlling the world.  Oooo.  Some might believe it, but everybody else would laugh in my face.
23859/0:I just hope Eeva's safe.
23860/0:I hope it's nothing serious.
23861/0:
23862/0:
23863/0:Fortunately we have visionaries like Her Holiness to guide our way.
23864/0:Now my technicians can be certain of our counter-nanite.  Come to New York, young Knight.  We have work to do.  Your pilot will have to meet you in Flight Bay 23 because my people cannot be interrupted.
23865/0:I don't mean to interrupt....
23866/0:That's the word from command.  Alex is their little brother, I guess.  Just as dangerous, though, if not more so.
23867/0:It must be a sign of the end times!
23868/0:I have a ballistic silencer, appropriate for any caliber barrel.  Also a black-market biomod canister, enables non-Piezochem functionality.  I've also got an SMG machine gun.  As a regular customer, you must pay full price for each.
23869/0:
23870/0:
23871/0:I said beat it.
23872/0:
23873/0:At first, the WTO meant planes always on schedule, more choices when you went shopping, more jobs...
23874/0:I should get back to work.
23875/0:She's as much Denton as you, thanks to the ApostleCorp infusions.  I sent her through the teleporter to locate and kill JC.
23876/0:We've survived other attacks.  We'll survive this one.
23877/0:Hey, I don't have much in the way of a reward, but this showdown just got me a big bonus and put me in tight with the Omar.  You're welcome to half.  Plus I'll throw in a little extra since you've made your own contribution to the Templar body count.  Good work.
23878/0:Do not trust this man.  Continue your search -- we need to know Dr. Nassif's location.  Search the director's private office off this room for clues to her whereabouts.  A datacube or vmail may point the way. 
23879/0:Primary objective:  Guard premises, admit only Alex D.
23880/0:WHAT!?
23881/0:Dr. Nassif, I want to know the truth -- what's MY story?
23882/0:What he decides will affect how billions of people live for centuries to come, but like all people he has to contend with his own frailty and petty appetites.
23883/0:That was almost too easy.  I wish hunting these Omar freaks was a bit more of a challenge.
23884/0:You will infiltrate the New Cairo arcology.  I will do the same and join you prior to the assault.
23885/0:Well, here's your chance to test his resolve.
23886/0:Watchin' two poor gobs tear each other apart... Now what's that say about human nature?
23887/0:Ha!  And my friends at home said Tarsus would be boring.
23888/0:Now that the beacon's been activated, it won't be long until we're far away from these nuts.
23889/0:Time to go.
23890/0:I guess it could come in handy.  I have some unfinished business in New York.
23891/0:Very soon we will be connected. A great Advance will change what it means to be human, and there will be no further need to conceal information.  But that world is not yet here.
23892/0:
23893/0:There are no more Nassifs in Cairo.  They've all been terminated.
23894/0:Harmless missionaries at the train station?  Or sleeper agents for a regime fundamentally opposed to commercial society?
23895/0:Good work.  Power is restored and the beacon is ready to be activated.  Just turn it on and your pilot will be able to land.  But first you must find a way into JC's sanctuary.  You are our only hope of reviving him.
23896/0:
23897/0:Yes, it's some consolation being close to my family.  Still, these monsters shed.  Little biocules and particulates from the infusions. Ugh. I have to shower the instant I get back from the office.  I worry about contaminating my home.
23898/0:Pick your move, Bug.  That's it...
23899/0:
23900/0:Are you... Her Holiness?  It's strange seeing you as just another person...
23901/0:What do you think you're doing?  I didn't see you pay on the way in.  You owe me 10 credits.
23902/0:Bet they aren't expecting to see Leo Jankowski.
23903/0:Wonder who he was before he became an Omar.
23904/0:You are taking food right out of the mouths of children!
23905/0:Well, hurry up, eh?
23906/0:I've deceived millions.  Hundreds of millions of people.  I -- I'm such a fool!
23907/0:What am I going to do!?
23908/0:That's what I just said.
23909/0:This'll be my first real engagement.  Hard to believe.
23910/0:There are those in the medina who might get you a pass for a price, but really all they're looking for are mercenaries to do their dirty work.  Me, I just want to help people out.  Give me a few credits for my trouble, and I'll act like you've got a pass.
23911/0:The WTO promised peace through trade, of course.  I should've known when the first thing the nanoformers put up was a wall.
23912/0:I'm protection to help them open shop in a scabland medina near New Cairo.  Two thousand per week -- plus mods.
23913/0:... Helios core... lower platform... nanite-capsid upgrate necessary... all five processing modules... go... lower platform... below...
23914/0:My pleasure.  I can't wait to see the faces of those self-satisfied arcology feebs when Pequod's shuts down and I take over the coffeeshop on Level 107.
23915/0:I'm here to see a doctor and nobody else.  Don't bother me about my beliefs.
23916/0:As you wish.  I just stopped by to talk to a friend of mine, Billie Adams.  She's working with the Order Church.
23917/0:If I can turn public opinion against the Order and WTO, then the Illuminati will have nothing.
23918/0:
23919/0:In the bull's eye today -- Lin-May Chen, High Augur of the Order Church.  Miss Chen, do you believe one damn thing you've said since you became a spokesperson for the Church?
23920/0:It wasn't exactly easy getting here.
23921/0:I don't know.  I'm still reeling from the shock...   But somehow it's starting to make sense now.  
23922/0:
23923/0:I'd like to take a look at the prototype.
23924/0:What are you doing down here?  Signing up with the Order Church like Billie?
23925/0:JC is waiting.  Go.
23926/0:Yes.  Beneath the ruins of the Black Gate, JC constructed a portal to his secret base in Antarctica.  Only descendents of the Denton cell-line can go through.  However, the facility is already in the hands of the Templars.
23927/0:
23928/0:You found the pilot beacon.  Activate it, and I'll be able to land.
23929/0:Please accept the sincere apologies of Standard Security.  Our people should have screened out the terrorists at the Lower Seattle entrance.
23930/0:No problem.  Just let me run to the ATM first.
23931/0:Whatever you say -- I owe ya.
23932/0:An unfortunate circumstance for both parties.
23933/0:Why not?  We're clearly the better soldiers.
23934/0:Sounds like a plan to me.
23935/0:You have the Aquinas Protocol, and here I am.  Your enemies are defeated.
23936/0:Something breaks, I'm gonna have them dust that keyboard for fingerprints.
23937/0:Young enemy, thy name is Pliable.  How quickly you kindle a faith in a brother you never knew.
23938/0:She is ahead of you, threatening to end JC.
23939/0:I never had any doubts you'd join us in the end.
23940/0:Don't blink, muchacha.
23941/0:I must save her!
23942/0:Hey -- I'm running.
23943/0:I'll think about it.
23944/0:Go.  Time is short.
23945/0:Maybe another time.
23946/0:It's not too late!  Just stop right now, and you won't bring that monster back into the world.
23947/0:Guess you're lookin' to get paid.
23948/0:And you're going to help the learning process by killing me?
23949/0:I was unable to locate Cairo International Airport.  This small landing pad was the closest I could come to the city center.
23950/0:And you are a Tarsus lady?  Yes?  Well, perhaps you can have a word with the headmaster.  I will give you my parental code: 74652.  Tarsus is on Level 107.  Tell the fat bum I want him to return my calls.  Where is my girl?  Why couldn't Leila find her last night?
23951/0:I'm pretty certain that a few mechanized units can tip the balance.
23952/0:I thought we had a deal, then I see Gob-zilla comin' down the chute.  If you wanted more money, you should've said so.
23953/0:Yo, someone's here!  See the scab?
23954/0:Very well.  You may use the English pilot.  I will depart for Liberty Island at once.  I will be needed once the Great Advance is complete.
23955/0:I think I heard somebody.  What do you think?
23956/0:If our other facilities survive, you will learn why.  Until then, to reveal more would be unwise.
23957/0:Wake up.  Just saw a shadow.  With me?
23958/0:I don't know who you are and I don't care.
23959/0:Hey, wasn't that door closed?
23960/0:Hey, wasn't that door open?
23961/0:Poor girl looks a little shook up.
23962/0:Man.  Someone's on a mission.  Know anything about this?
23963/0:Well done.  Our enemies will become known to us.  Return to the medina for your compensation.
23964/0:You took your own sweet time, didn't you?
23965/0:Know who put that there?
23966/0:My alliances are my own concern.  But yes, I'm heading to Mako next.
23967/0:Hey....  Hey!  Who took it?
23968/0:Totaled.  What do you think?
23969/0:If humanity is to have a future, it must be protected.  That is all we are trying to do.
23970/0:Know how it got trashed?
23971/0:Won't be long before one cult or another tries to force itself on EVERYBODY.  You better drink to that, young sir.
23972/0:At least we've got breathers now.  I hope they're enough to protect my children.
23973/0:
23974/0:Lots of people, coming and going.
23975/0:Her Holiness and I amicably disagree also.  My Shard in Germany has a profound respect for the founding doctrines of the Order.  What we don't understand are these recent revisions and reversals that seem to excuse the resurgence -- through the WTO -- of blind commercial interests.
23976/0:Stand back -- SSC on duty.
23977/0:Maybe another time.
23978/0:The commander can answer your questions.
23979/0:Well done.  Amid great evil, your heart has remained pure.
23980/0:Not likely.  The Templars have cells all over the medina.  But maybe you got the one who would've tipped the balance.  Thanks for sticking your neck out.  I'll split my first combat bonus with you if these Omar make it through the raid.
23981/0:You... look like one of the test subjects.
23982/0:The Templars have commissioned a new grade of firearm from Mako -- the Mag Rail.  The Order very much opposes the creation of any new weapons.  Your other objective will be to locate the scientist in charge and kill him.
23983/0:Okay...  I'm Alex.
23984/0:Between the radiation and the bots, the risk isn't worth it.
23985/0:Heh.  So many people come to Upper Seattle with high hopes.  When I got my work-pass I thought that this job was just the first step to becoming an enclave citizen.  That was eight years ago.  They pay me too little to ever get out of this job.
23986/0:
23986/1:
23986/2:
23986/3:
23986/4:
23986/5:
23987/0:Great work.  The JC-Helios AI has already integrated the Aquinas protocol.
23988/0:He nearly died two years ago.  My chief scientist, Tracer Tong, thought that he had perfected the biomod substrate, but there were recombinant anomalies in Paul.  He had to be cryogenically frozen to save his life.  Luckily, you and the other subjects at last accepted complete transformation.
23989/0:You must be wondering if there is a connection between this attack and Chicago.  I don't think so.
23990/0:Her Holiness will be pleased -- and you will be rewarded.  Praise Order, praise your loyalty.  Now slip away.  Your pilot will be waiting on the roof.
23991/0:Yo, why's it acting up?
23992/0:It's down.  What's the deal?
23993/0:Hush!  Hush!  Let an old man have his pleasant thoughts.  Would you do me a favor?
23994/0:Hey!  Did someone throw that?
23995/0:How'd that get turned on?
23996/0:You will appreciate our merchandise.  Your purchases will be restricted to the highest market prices because of your earlier attack on our kind.
23997/0:How'd that get turned off?
23998/0:These kids study some pretty crazy stuff.  My school certainly wasn't this demanding.
23999/0:What's the deal?  Somebody just open this?
24000/0:More decryptions of my communications?
24001/0:What's the deal?  Somebody just shut this?
24002/0:Who turned on the light?
24003/0:Who turned off the light?
24004/0:What are you going to do?
24005/0:What's the deal?  Think a person caused that?
24006/0:Mmmm.  Crikey, I didn't ask.  As soon as women start talking politics, I go blank.  But I wouldn't mind raising some fuel money so I could see her again.  I'll take you wherever you need to go.  [500 credits.]
24007/0:
24008/0:The air's clean in the medina now, and the Templars haven't seized full control there.  That's where we need to go.
24009/0:I'm not showin' you my foot.
24010/0:I did give myself some extra overtime pay, though, heh heh, to make up for all that I had to do around here back then.
24011/0:There is nothing more for you to do here.
24012/0:As soon as that beacon's activated, we'll all breathe a bit easier.
24013/0:Just hang around a little while -- I'm not sure where I want to go yet.
24014/0:Just a minute.
24015/0:Pequod's.  Coffee for your kind of world.
24016/0:Some nut set a fire.  Any idea who?
24017/0:Yo, what's up with that smoke?
24018/0:Whose blood?
24019/0:Someone been fightin'?
24020/0:Check it out.  Over there.
24020/1:The scab's still around here somewhere.  Check it out.
24021/0:Omar adaptations will soon encompass every climate and biohazard on Earth -- and many more environments that may exist elsewhere.  You have earned preferred customer status -- a fifty percent reduction in prices.
24022/0:I saw somethin' goin' down over there.
24023/0:I saw it.  Hey, yo, go that way.
24024/0:You're leavin' your scent on the playing field!
24025/0:The dude's over there.
24025/1:He can't be far.  Maybe over there.
24026/0:Archer has to be stopped.  But we are just kids.
24027/0:The chick's over there.
24027/1:She can't be far.  Maybe over there.
24028/0:In good time, friend.
24029/0:This one already told the other one from JC everything.  Betrayal.  This one was to be set free, but it was more lies and destruction.  You must not betray.  JC may be in danger already.
24030/0:Nice.  You scout the place out, and I'll make sure we cross paths before the action starts.
24031/0:I want the ammo clip. [400]
24032/0:Hey, I was just attacked by your colleagues at the Tarsus school.  I think the headmaster has assembled his own private security force.
24033/0:Well, okay.  But I go first.
24034/0:I never saw one credit from the very gob I DISCOVERED and helped to track down.
24035/0:We will guide everyone to true Order.
24036/0:What are you selling?
24037/0:No time for chit-chat.
24038/0:You now have the Templar army behind you.
24039/0:
24040/0:We're talking about the rioting in Trier.  Order religious fanatics inciting workers to destroy the lawful property of the Panzerworks factory.
24041/0:
24042/0:Are the leaders planning to hold a press conference or anything?
24043/0:They gave you a locker.  Nassif'll give you the code when it's time for target practice.
24044/0:Sounds like the scab's over that way.
24045/0:Biomods are part of the training.  We knew what they'd do to our tissues.
24046/0:Beats me.
24046/1:Hell if I know.
24046/2:Just chill.  It's nothing.
24047/0:Hi.
24047/1:Yeah, you bad.
24048/0:Shut your face.
24048/1:Hi.
24049/0:(growl) ... feebs and scabs...
24049/1:Great digs.
24049/2:What up, feeb?
24049/3:Just scurry on by.  I'm busy.
24049/4:You don't impress ME.
24050/0:That's my only reward -- a discount?
24051/0:That's right -- I'm lookin' at YOU, dude.
24052/0:That's right -- I'm lookin' at YOU, missy.
24053/0:I had a run-in with some Templars in the apartment building across from the mosque.  Maybe I scared them off.
24054/0:Shut up.
24054/1:... waitin' for my chance.
24055/0:I know what you must be thinking.  Don't worry.  This won't be a repeat of Chicago.
24056/0:Hi, officer.
24056/1:You need anything -- I'm here.  On your side.  Serious.
24057/0:... mindin' my own business, officer!  // scared
24057/1:What?  I do somethin'?
24058/0:I like being my own boss.  Tag whatever I want, no more, "Shannon, collate this.  Shannon, I need this in triplicate."
24059/0:Something else that might work -- just blow the whole thing up with a grenade.
24060/0:You guys are the pros -- Tarsus grads, I mean.  I'm just tryin' to make a living.
24061/0:No.  You listen.  The truth is in the Word, the old writings, the meditations on the 52 cetasikas.  Saman says only this, and I agree.  The truth is not in secret deals with bankers and factory owners.
24062/0:I'd like to make a trade.  You look modified.  Well, I have a biomod canister in my Lost-and-Found, probably left here by one of those little rakes from the Tarsus school, who are always playing spy games in the office suites.  It's yours if you convince Mrs. Withers for me.  Offer her a generous bribe.  [500 credits.]
24063/0:Like you -- look at you.  I bet you have been fed like a little bird since you were an infant -- petted, encouraged, juiced up biomedically... Yes, I know who I am looking at.
24064/0:Good work.  You found the financial data that the enclave's Civic Manager is interested in -- evidence of tax evasion, I bet.  I'm sure that he would be happy to give you a Citizen's Bonus if you reported the information to him at the WTO Air Terminal.
24065/0:What?  More modified scum?  We'll take care of you.
24066/0:Hold on -- I can't carry anything else right now.
24067/0:Thanks.
24068/0:More decryptions of my communications?
24069/0:... gotta do it if I want the cash...
24069/1:... shakin' up the whole scene...
24069/2:Pulled on me, from out the pocket, plasma slugs...
24069/3:Threatenin' my friends...
24070/0:Okay...  I'm Alex.
24071/0:It ain't right.
24071/1:Bummer.
24071/2:I've been there.  // sympathy
24072/0:... but I can stand up to it.
24072/1:But I think I got it all worked out.
24072/2:Just watch, though.   You'll see.
24072/3:That's where I draw the line.
24073/0:You need somethin', just let me know.
24073/1:Helluva situation.
24073/2:I'd break some skulls if it was me.
24073/3:Someone's gotta come clean.
24074/0:That's right, man.
24075/0:I'm in no position to be disbursing handouts.  This WTO investigtor is about to have me bankrupted with fines.  Deal's off, whatever I might have told you.
24076/0:That's right, sis'.
24077/0:If SSC would have shut down the Order months ago, there would be no riot and we would not be living under lockdown now.
24078/0:They may have surprised us, but it looks like you surprised them more.
24079/0:No one informed me of such an occurrence.  You should assume that the concert started on schedule.  Hurry!  Tickets are 200 credits at the door.
24080/0:I have two black-market biomod canisters which enable non-Piezochem functionality.  Also:  three concussion prox mines, which you can plant on any flat surface to be detonated by movement within close range.  As a preferred customer, you may purchase items at half-price.
24081/0:They said it was for someone who wanted his shipment and privacy protected.  Ha!  I never trust those late-night deliveries.
24082/0:Yes.  Tomorrow evening.  You're gonna come, right?  Come on, it'll be fun!
24083/0:Talk to Commander Maxwell, it's not up to me who can travel and who can't.
24084/0:Right.  Well, I'll take out whoever you want for 2000 credits.
24085/0:Excellent.  You've done much to bring peace to this neglected part of the city.  Now go to the Greasel Pit bar and find Sid Black.  I bet he will be happy to take you to Mako.
24086/0:Live -- from Cairo, where the Headmaster of a Tarsus Academy has been reported to the SSC as a threat to the students he oversees.
24087/0:
24088/0:test.
24089/0:I think I'm going to ask for my old assignment back -- Hell's Kitchen.
24090/0:Is that illegal?
24091/0:I said, "Take my things to the VIP lounge" -- and they stick me down here.
24092/0:Sure, take out Dumier's commandos on the dock.  [2000]
24093/0:If you want to pay me back, maybe you could find a pilot to take you to the Statue of Liberty in New York.
24094/0:Now we've got two of you freaks working for us.  The opposition is falling apart.
24095/0:They had better get this sorted out soon.
24096/0:Good work, Tarsus man.  Here's your compensation.  I wonder what lucky corporations get to hire the Tarsus grads.
24097/0:Please leave me alone -- I am in class right now.
24098/0:Leave me alone.
24099/0:I've got my eye on you.
24100/0:Who's pleading?  I won't give you the code here -- I'll infolink it to you once you're at the entrance.  That way I'll have enough time to get away.  If you want the deal, just go to the bay door.
24101/0:Whatever its shortcomings, the Church has at least brought stability to a large part of the world.
24102/0:Never was too lucky.  That's why I don't bet on the fights.
24103/0:Verified: open.  Investigating activity.
24104/0:Are you sure we can trust JC?  Even after the merger and Antarctica?  Have you looked around?  All he's done -- I have to wonder about his sanity.
24105/0:Verified: closed.  Investigating activity.
24106/0:
24107/0:Verified: on.  Investigating activity.
24108/0:Verified: off.  Investigating activity.
24109/0:Investigating fire.
24110/0:Scanning victim.

24120/0:Autonomous processing interrupted.
24121/0:The New Age cannot be prevented.
24122/0:Damn it!  I'll stop you myself.
24123/0:I mean, you down with bein' a Knight?  A Knight Templar?
24124/0:The Aquinas hub -- It is the heart of the old structures...
24125/0:One of the trainers, probably.  Greedy scabs -- they're the real animals in my book.  So what's your bet?  Snake-eyes challenging the Claw.  Four-to-one against Snake-eyes.
24126/0:Of course they are.  Tarsus is the best school in the WTO.  They would not let anything happen to their best recruits.
24127/0:I don't know much about your kind, but you seem far more articulate than an ordinary Gray.
24128/0:I have tried again and again to get accepted into the arcology.
24129/0:My pleasure.
24130/0:What's the difference?
24131/0:Uh-oh... messed THAT up.
24132/0:They will pay for their trespassing.
24133/0:Internal damage.  Need repairs.
24134/0:Stay sharp, Chicago.
24135/0:This is gonna be my job...
24136/0:...and now onto the rest of the Nassif clan.  Immediately.
24137/0:Where to?
24138/0:Autonomous processing restored.
24139/0:(electric squeal) Evading attack!

24149/0:You can hardly criticize me after you've been injuring innocents by shooting up the SSC station.
24150/0:I thought when I got this assignment it would be a quiet one.
24151/0:I take it you heard the "disturbance."
24152/0:I've heard that there are groups within the church that want to take even more drastic action.
24153/0:I already killed a lawyer in the Emerald Suites.

24155/0:What do I look like?  A taxi driver?
24156/0:First fight of the night... Take it from me, you missed a wet one.
24157/0:You look modified.
24158/0:
24159/0:What do you require?
24160/0:This is a secured campus.  I wouldn't go poking my nose into people's windows.
24161/0:Well, if we're lucky you'll be giving the portal a test-drive before too long.  Good to have you with us.  I had my staff procure this extra biomod canister so that you might be a more effective operative.
24162/0:See, I drop my birds on the curb.  You're on the roof of the Mako Ballistics main complex.  I got you past the bots and surveillance downstairs. 
24163/0:(beep-beep) Make way.
24163/1:Watch your step.
24163/2:Alert.  Cleaner bot present.
24164/0:Greetings.
24165/0:Until further notice, Mr. Dumier will conduct business only from behind a secure barrier.
24166/0:Swarm deployed.
24166/1:Releasing bots.
24167/0:Systems need repair.
24168/0:Subsumption (garble garble) error (garble) systems (squeal) error (bleep) error.
24169/0:Ceasing operation.
24170/0:Autonomous processing interrupted.
24171/0:New Cairo atmospheric conditions -- normal.
24172/0:Autonomous processing restored.  Scanning for source of disruption.
24173/0:Don't WTO policies discourage price fluctuations?
24174/0:Processing anomaly...
24174/1:Signal disruption.
24175/0:Situation uncertain.
24175/1:Pursuing additional information.
24176/0:Alex.  You seem to have business in many different places.
24177/0:We remain enemies, true.  That doesn't mean we can't be civil to each other.
24178/0:I hope this is a psychological tactic on Nassif and not you stalling so you can carry out some vendetta.  I will uphold the WTO's regulations and stop you myself.
24179/0:So the Order hired you to kill the chief scientist on the Mag Rail project.  A pretty way to do business.  The WTO prefers that you spare the scientist and instead upload the gun's schematics to our Seattle headquarters.  By law all innovations must be registered and patented through one of our offices.
24180/0:
24181/0:
24182/0:Next we will find out that the Order and WTO are branches of the same organization.
24183/0:Here's the data I uncovered.  Looks like the owner has some undeclared sources of income.
24184/0:The unlock weapons scan is automatic.  I don't have to do anything.
24185/0:Chairman Dumier, the leader of your opposition, has taken a special interest in your safety.
24186/0:Look out, Alex!
24187/0:You rescued my brother -- but not before letting the Templars make him into a lab monkey.
24188/0:Homicide unresolved.  Archiving evidence.
24189/0:Reviewing audio data.
24189/1:Noise detected.
24190/0:Engagement unresolved.  Archiving data.
24191/0:Intrusion unresolved.  Archiving data.
24192/0:Additional data.  Assessing...
24192/1:Reassessing potential threat.
24193/0:Failure to locate the thief.
24194/0:Investigating specific threat.
24194/1:Likely organic.
24195/0:Maps available for this region.
24196/0:Anybody I know?  I spent a right many days in that town with Cindy and her mangy friends.
24197/0:Scan inconclusive.
24197/1:Clear.  Downgrading alert.
24198/0:Be advised.  Force has been authorised.
24198/1:Hostile encounter considered likely.
24199/0:Where's your mask?  Want to get sick?
24200/0:Visual inconclusive.
24201/0:You think Leo Jankowski can't protect himself?
24202/0:Investigating sound.
24202/1:Compound waveform -- likely presence of intruder.
24203/0:Warning: restricted area.
24204/0:Shall we go?  I will be your pilot until we reach Liberty Island.
24205/0:Closing in.
24206/0:I suggest you report this to the media.  Force the parent company to come clean.
24207/0:Excellent.  Will aid Illuminati.  Very wise, indeed.
24208/0:No more caprice in determining the course of human affairs.
24209/0:Alex Denton.  How does it feel to share such an infamous name?  Don't be deluded by the AI's ingenuity.  Your brother, JC, has long since been devoured by the Helios core, and if you revive Paul you will be reviving a sworn terrorist.  There is a better way.  More when you reach Cairo.
24210/0:Matter clip's always useful, but I can't afford it. [400]
24211/0:Seriously -- how was it?  Smooth ride?
24212/0:Did you tell him about the other proposals?  He thinks you stole his idea.
24213/0:Hang tight.  I'll be right back.
24214/0:Destroying lifeform.
24215/0:Target reacquired.
24216/0:No weaponry detected.
24217/0:Target occluded.
24217/1:Enemy hidden.
24218/0:At this rate, they're going to need to hire someone full time for PR.
24219/0:Clearing enemy position.
24219/1:Response effective.
24220/0:Enemy targeting error.
24220/1:Attack evaded.  Continuing operation.
24221/0:Security squad M7 to the main entrance immediately.
24222/0:So you see yourself as a god?
24223/0:Analyzing system damage.
24223/1:Damage sustained.
24224/0:Severe damage.
24224/1:Auxillary circuits engaged.  Reduced survivability. 
24225/0:Systems failing.
24225/1:Hull plates vulnerable.
24226/0:Extreme heat.  Compensating.
24227/0:To reach the other levels of the arcology, exit the air terminal and take the ramp to the elevator.  It will take you to the main arcology concourse.  From there, you can reach the coffeeshop or the elevator to the Mosque, via which you can exit the arcology entirely.
24228/0:Did I do something wrong?
24229/0:Unclear.  One of their commanders was facing trial, and I guess Templar extremism appealed to some of our Seekers.  The Church seems to be losing ground in disadvantaged neighborhoods, where the poor are quick to join any cause that makes them feel powerful.
24230/0:Guess I better check out the Greasel Pit.
24231/0:You owe it to them--and to the world--to find out.
24232/0:Thanks.
24233/0:I found Her Holiness.  Turns out she's Nicolette DuClare -- an Illuminatus.
24234/0:Earlier today, WTO Director Chad Dumier proposed a summit meeting between his organization and Order officials in response to the rioting in Trier, Germany.
24235/0:I think I understand NG, you know?  She's a lot like me.
24236/0:
24237/0:They are filled with hatred.... here to destroy JC and our clan.
24238/0:Thank you for undoing some of the Hateful Ones' damage.
24239/0:What the hell are you doing?  You were supposed to get him to safety, not murder him.
24240/0:The Black Gate ruins are up ahead.  Access to the underground facility is on the second level of the complex.
24241/0:That sounds like it's from Mark Finley, Seattle's Minister of Culture.  Now why would he be talking to Nassif about hiding a shipment?   Is Tarsus involved in some sort of smuggling operation?
24242/0:Negligible damage.
24243/0:So you fly modified humans around the world.  That's a pretty weird assignment.  Any luck?
24244/0:Targeting accurate.
24244/1:Ranged weapon successful.
24245/0:Threat neutralized.
24245/1:Countermeasures successful.
24246/0:
24247/0:Coordinating with additional unit.
24248/0:Without Aquinas, they will be powerless.  Their followers lack conviction -- even you, the hand-picked Guardian of their Republics.
24249/0:Summoning additional units.
24250/0:Summoning medical bot.
24251/0:Sure.  Wanna keep a low profile?  Manage the line-of-sight situation.  Hide behind things.  Watch where the enemy's head is facing.  And listen.  I'm always surprised how much these amateur commandos give away by talking to themselves during a fight.
24252/0:Listen.  Her Holiness is speaking.
24253/0:Be aware that any infractions will be met with maximum force allowable by Trier law.  
24254/0:The last place the authorities will look is the Nur Gewehre shop.  I am a respected businessman.
24255/0:
24256/0:We interrogated one of Captain Lamar's people.  She said that the scientists in this laboratory are the ones who smuggled Dr. Nassif and her colleagues out of the city.  See if you can find a clue to Dr. Nassif's whereabouts in the lab director's office.
24257/0:The concept of arcology was developed by Paolo Soleri in early modern pre-Collapse society, during the 1960s.  Simply put, it is the fusion of architecture with ecology.
24258/0:We're so fortunate that Luminon Saman had the vision to lead us away from ruin.
24259/0:That'll show the sneaky beggars not to sidestep trade regulations.  Good work.
24260/0:Just another day at the Pit.
24261/0:Pequod's.  Coffee for your kind of world.
24262/0:A true democracy will prevent militant cults the Templars from gaining so much influence over the weak-minded. 
24263/0:It's all the same to me, lady.
24264/0:We can deal with this.
24264/1:I think they'd want us to stand firm.
24264/2:Don't expect us to back down.
24265/0:We can deal with this.
24265/1:I think they'd want us to stand firm.
24265/2:Don't expect us to back down.
24266/0:How'd I get into this...?
24266/1:Wow.   // full of dread
24266/2:Now what?!  // jumpy
24266/3:Oh Jeez... // panic
24267/0:Summoning repair bot.
24268/0:How'd I get into this...?
24268/1:Wow.   // full of dread
24268/2:Now what?!  // jumpy
24268/3:Oh Jeez... // panic
24269/0:Negative result.  Altering heuristic.

24270/1:This doesn't look good.
24271/0:Pathway blocked.
24272/0:No heroes...
24272/1:This doesn't look good.
24273/0:If you want to keep your state-of-the-art development facility, you'll continue developing these "toys" for the rich.
24274/0:Doorway blocked.

24275/2:Oh God no!
24275/3:It's over!  Oh, hell...  // despair
24275/4:Don't do it!
24276/0:There were not enough police to fight back against the Templars, I guess.
24277/0:Explosive deployed.
24278/0:(scream)
24278/1:I'm just doin' my job... // panicked
24278/2:Oh God no!

24283/0:Yo, not now.  My gob's in the ring!
24284/0:Termination authorized.
24284/1:Tactic anticipated.
24285/0:Success probable.
24285/1:Implementing battle resolution.
24286/0:Uh -- not exactly.
24287/0:A bad career move for NG, if you ask me.
24288/0:Sssh.  Someone might hear us.  Maybe you should go.
24289/0:It's called Plague 11.  You must not be from around here.
24290/0:There are some things I like to keep my own counsel about.
24291/0:
24291/1:
24292/0:Sure.  Stand here as long as you want.  We're not doin' anything important.
24293/0:No thanks necessary.  Compensation for whistle-blowers is one of the pillars of a safe community.
24294/0:Attachment received.
24295/0:I can't risk putting the Inclinator back online until we're sure the area's decontaminated.
24296/0:Huh?
24296/1:Hello?
24296/2:Maybe something's up?
24297/0:We're dead...
24297/1:There's no escape!
24297/2:We're next!
24298/0:Her Holiness inspires us all to reject the selfish utilitarian attitudes propagated by the WTO.
24299/0:This guy's a monster!
24300/0:This guy's a monster!
24301/0:This woman's a monster!
24302/0:Mr. O'Rourke is sleeping.  Try again tomorrow.
24303/0:Target employing biomods.
24304/0:This woman's a monster!
24305/0:Good...
24305/1:Yes!
24305/2:Want another?
24305/3:Bam!  Just like on the range.
24305/4:Pow!  Knock'em down.
24306/0:Good...
24306/1:Yes!
24306/2:Want another?
24306/3:Pow!
24306/4:Not a bad shot...
24306/5:Oh my, that's gotta sting...
24307/0:Enemy moves at trans-human speed.
24308/0:See?  I mean business!
24308/1:... try and mess with ME...
24309/0:Thanks.  You're clear to enter now.
24310/0:(bleep)
24310/1:(static)
24310/2:(pops)
24311/0:See?  I mean business!
24311/1:... try and mess with ME...
24312/0:Sounds as though you like it here.
24313/0:Target assessment: vulnerable.  Proceeding.
24313/1:Calculating mission risk.... negligible.
24314/0:They won't blink an eye if I off you, dude.
24314/1:... won't be the first time I had to kill a guy.
24315/0:Target assessment: average.  Proceeding.
24315/1:Calculating mission risk.... acceptable.
24316/0:Target assessment: formidable.  Accessing tactical database. 
24316/1:Calculating mission risk... substantial.
24316/2:Mission jeopardized.
24317/0:I've been moved to Seattle?  What about Billie?  Is she here, too?
24318/0:System failure.
24319/0:Shh.  You'll disturb their studies.
24320/0:I will remain with my craft.
24321/0:Reminds me of the early days after the Collapse, when some governments used nukes to put down plagues and nanite swells.
24322/0:If we're really going to make a difference, we should observe their operation -- find out who they're doing business with and how they're getting their supplies.
24323/0:
24324/0:The SSC handles security for the entire Cairo arcology.
24325/0:If the Order would just get out of Trier, there would be no more trouble.
24326/0:I guess I don't have to ask whether you're still working for the Omar.
24327/0:If we're really going to make a difference, we should observe their operation -- find out who they're doing business with and how they're getting their supplies.
24328/0:They won't blink an eye if I off you, dude.
24328/1:... won't be the first time I had to kill a guy.
24329/0:Well, I hope I didn't steal your thunder.  When you get to the dock, you'll probably come across his dead body.
24330/0:They won't blink an eye if I off you, babe.
24330/1:... won't be the first time I had to kill a lady.
24331/0:I was the Champ.  Three whole months on top of the world.
24332/0:They won't blink an eye if I off you, babe.
24332/1:... won't be the first time I had to kill a lady.
24333/0:I think I did some damage!
24333/1:See that shot? 
24334/0:Combat support required.
24335/0:I think I did some damage!
24336/0:Fulfilling directive.
24337/0:I got him!  // elated
24338/0:Scanning.
24338/1:Processing.
24338/2:Surveyed region clear.
24339/0:I got him!  // elated
24340/0:(air jets)
24340/1:(motor hums)
24340/2:(data transmission)  // a la Empire Strikes Back black probes
24341/0:I got her!  // elated
24342/0:You must be looking for the weapons lab.  You're on the wrong side of the building.
24343/0:New file opened.  Your actions will be recorded.
24344/0:I got her!  // elated
24345/0:Interference with security systems is a criminal act.
24345/1:Unauthorized contact.
24346/0:Got it.
24347/0:Could be.  Clive here was just telling me about it.  Tarsus Academy, right?  Usually the Order goes after the Inclinator.
24348/0:Do not linger.
24348/1:Curiosity noted.
24349/0:Behavior heuristic unnacceptable.
24349/1:First warning: go about your business.
24350/0:I've seen others fall for his pretty deceptions.  They ended up doing unspeakably ugly things. 
24351/0:
24352/0:Clearance denied.  Return to your place of origin.
24353/0:Threat classification: minor.
24353/1:Interference with security platforms: not advisable.
24354/0:Excellent.  The bay doors are opening.  I will be landing soon.
24355/0:How's it goin'?
24356/0:Thanks for the help.  I guess they weren't kidding about you Tarsus recruits.
24357/0:
24358/0:I've got work to do.
24359/0:
24360/0:
24361/0:
24362/0:I can only take so much.
24363/0:Save the attitude, D.  The Pit pays.  Here you go -- double your money.  House takes ten percent.
24364/0:Got it.
24365/0:Stay true, young Pliable.  Now go to the Statue and step into JC Denton's machine so that the ducts will be primed with your nanite-capsid architecture.  My scientists will do the rest.
24366/0:Let's go -- hand-to-hand!
24366/1:(growl)
24366/2:I know how to fight.
24367/0:
24368/0:Let's go -- hand-to-hand!
24368/1:(growl)
24368/2:I know how to fight.
24369/0:I did it!
24369/1:Glad that's over.
24369/2:... never know what's gonna happen next.
24369/3:Training really was useful.
24369/4:Now I know I can handle myself.
24369/5:They don't just hand out these uniforms, you know?
24369/6:Damn!  Went right down.
24369/7:Sweet.
24370/0:Minor infraction.  Protocol forbids retaliation.
24371/0:I did it!
24371/1:Glad that's over.
24371/2:... bet that was a shock.
24371/3:Phew.  Made it.
24371/4:I tried to warn you.
24371/5:They don't just hand out these uniforms, you know?
24371/6:Right on -- more hazard pay.
24371/7:Well, THERE'S a story to tell the grandkids...
24372/0:Now if you'll excuse me, I'm expecting a visitor.
24373/0:Violation noted.
24374/0:Another gob bites the dust.
24374/1:... clean this place up...
24375/0:Additional collisions could result in a security reclassification.
24375/1:Security platforms are authorized to protect operational capability with force.
24376/0:Another gob bites the dust.
24376/1:... clean this place up...
24377/0:Your continued interest has been classified as suspicious.
24378/0:That was a pretty dangerous character.
24378/1:... some sort of pro, it looks like.
24379/0:Behavior heuristic classified as hostile.
24379/1:Normalize your behavior.
24380/0:That was a pretty dangerous character.
24380/1:... some sort of pro, it looks like.
24381/0:Here is a line from the Salesman's Handbook: "Promise them the world but always dangle it just out of reach."
24382/0:A well-designed psychological tool.
24383/0:Leave the area.  Requesting immediate compliance.
24384/0:... a determined son-of-a-gun...
24384/1:Did I get him?  I think I got him.
24385/0:Warning: threat classification has been modified upward.
24385/1:Weapons must remain concealed.  Please observe this policy.
24386/0:Why don't you keep your mouth shut and just stay out of SSC's way?
24387/0:Hull damage.  Subsequent damage may warrant retaliation.
24388/0:This is what you've signed on for -- bloody mercenary work for the Templars?   I thought you were better than that, Billie.
24389/0:Threat classification: high.
24389/1:Violators are expected to heed all security-platform warnings.
24390/0:Some of my friends go to those meetings and say they're not militaristic at all.  It's all harmless mumbo-jumbo as far as I'm concerned.
24391/0:Final warning.  Battle systems ready.
24391/1:Threat classification: extreme.  Battle systems ready.
24392/0:WTO incorporation seemed like a good idea fifteen years ago.
24393/0:Thanks, I'll take the Ammo Scavenger.
24394/0:Just stay out of the way.  Too many patients, no time for chitchat.
24395/0:The Templars came out of nowhere.  Our intelligence people really dropped the ball this time.
24396/0:I was just trying to make it safe to work at Panzerwerks again.
24397/0:... a determined son-of-a-gun...
24398/0:... one determined woman...
24398/1:Did I get her?  I think I got her.
24399/0:... one determined woman...
24400/0:You may pass.
24401/0:That was all me...
24401/1:Someone owes me a beer.
24401/2:Count it!  That was mine.
24402/0:That was all me...
24402/1:Someone owes me a beer.
24403/0:
24404/0:Got him!
24405/0:Talk to Sales.  I just built the thing.  Don't ask me why we want to arm a bunch of bigots.  Genetic purists, ha!
24406/0:Got him!
24407/0:Just having a little argument about who makes the best coffee.
24408/0:Just follow your instincts.  You'll make the right decision.
24409/0:Got her!
24410/0:Dr. Nassif was telling the truth.  I'm a clone of JC Denton.
24411/0:Got her!
24412/0:I took care of it.
24413/0:This is a maintenance area.  Limited access.
24414/0:For now, we must work quietly and thanklessly.
24415/0:The Tarsus program may be unconventional, but trust me -- we take care of our trainees.
24416/0:... yes... merging... merging... Find me near the entrance to the sanctuary.  I have so much to tell you.
24417/0:An acceptable exchange.
24418/0:A lot of those uptown feebs are health nuts, I hear.  Our one-hundred percent organic drink menu is made for them.
24419/0:You escaped this time, but let that be a lesson.  There will be serious consequences if you continue to oppose the Order Church.  I expect you to listen to me from now on.
24420/0:Some people in the medina think these are just for show, but I KNOW.  I work here.  The counter-agent gets encoded at that computer terminal over there.
24421/0:First I need you to upload the Aquinas specification, then we will deal with the situation inside the Statue.
24422/0:Order reconnaissance?
24423/0:
24423/1:
24423/2:
24423/3:
24424/0:After this, I doubt I'll be trusting SSC with my life again.
24425/0:A few extreme activists -- that's all.  Her Holiness came here to try to settle it peacefully -- and Panzerwerks responds by erupting into riots.
24426/0:Political thinkers of the Enlightenment were building a clockwork.  We need to assemble a genome.
24427/0:I took care of it.
24428/0:So this is how it's gonna be.
24428/1:You better believe it.
24428/2:Words "combat pay" mean anything to you?
24428/3:SSC means business, loser.
24428/4:I almost feel SORRY for you.
24429/0:We thought we had enough troops ready to deal with anything that could happen.  I guess we were wrong.
24430/0:So this is it!
24430/1:You don't look so good.
24430/2:SSC means business, loser.
24430/3:Let's go!
24430/4:Come  on, right here.
24431/0:That's because you never tried to leave.  Believe me, you would have been killed the second you let down those scientists -- the ones posted around your bedroom back there.
24432/0:I've already dealt with the situation in Flight Bay 24.
24433/0:I'm not playin' around here!
24433/1:Your butt equals my commission.
24434/0:I'm not playin' around here!
24434/1:Your butt equals my commission.
24434/2:Come a little closer and I'll pop that zit for ya...
24435/0:Go for it, dude.
24436/0:Go for it, dude.
24437/0:Is that what you plan to tell corporate headhunters?  "What the hell?"
24438/0:Go for it, babe.
24439/0:Don't be a nuisance.
24440/0:Go for it, babe.
24441/0:This one could be worth some money...
24441/1:Let's do our job.
24442/0:To the Dentons consciousness is a building material.  To the Illuminati consciousness is a currency.
24443/0:It's not for public use anymore.  You'll have to wait in line and get proper clearance like everyone else now.
24444/0:What do you want?  I'm busy.
24445/0:Where is it?
24446/0:One life.  Insignificant, I would think, for the leader of the Illuminati.
24447/0:For Order's sake, hurry!
24448/0:
24449/0:Thanks for helping me pass the time.
24450/0:Risks that might jeopardize your mission, I presume.
24451/0:Guess it's my lucky night.  Gob-zilla gets cooked in her own cage -- now Snake-eyes is the new Champ!  It's been a long time comin', lemme tell ya.
24452/0:I'm proud I did what I could to stop that factory from polluting the earth -- but I'm not a thief.
24453/0:zxczxczxc
24454/0:
24455/0:You're in the game, D.  Now get in there and shake your pom-poms for Snake-eyes.  He'll be comin' out the north chute!
24456/0:Why's that?
24457/0:Archer's plans for my family are finished.
24458/0:There he is.  Captain Lamar and the Templar fugitive appear to be having some sort of conference in the office overlooking the platform.  Find out what this is all about.
24459/0:The repairs will be simple -- nothing more serious than a bad radiator hose.
24460/0:This one could be worth some money...
24460/1:Let's do our job.
24461/0:He's all ours.
24462/0:He's all ours.
24463/0:Not that I don't trust you -- but I'm staying right here.
24464/0:She's all ours.
24465/0:I'm stuck out here. (cough cough)  And I haven't been able to work on any of my poetry...  I was always meant to be an arcology citizen.  No one here will ever appreciate my writing.
24466/0:She's all ours.
24467/0:Freak...
24467/1:Chew on THIS!
24468/0:I'm scared, Alex.  We're completely on our own, and we can't trust ANYBODY.... The only thing I know is that I'm not a killer.  Here, do you want this weapon mod?  I don't have a use for it anymore.
24469/0:Freak...
24469/1:Chew on THIS!
24470/0:Not bad, not bad...
24470/1:Right on.
24471/0:Not bad, not bad...
24471/1:Right on.
24472/0:You made a big mistake.
24472/1:We don't get paid much, but we can do the job.
24473/0:Go on.  You've got my attention.
24474/0:Final match is four-to-one odds.  Buy-in begins right after this fight, after which the odds stand, even if something happens to one trainer's lineup.
24475/0:The facility's under attack -- by who?
24476/0:Hurt me, and I guarantee that you won't leave the arcology alive.
24477/0:Looks like you've divided your loyalties.  I hope eventually you'll pledge yourself to the Order.  In any event, you'll be heading for the Mako facility next, I imagine.
24478/0:Hallway patrol is normal Tarsus procedure.
24479/0:My wife wants me to try to get a job in the arcology.  She doesn't understand that working there will only bring our family more materialism and chaos.
24480/0:A Headmaster's work is never done.
24481/0:One day they rent an apartment, then everyone's wearing bath robes and they have a church in the middle of town.
24482/0:I cannot believe these delays today!
24483/0:You disagree with the way High Augur Chen is doing things?
24484/0:Move along.
24485/0:That's the only joke I can ever remember.
24486/0:They ambushed me.  Didn't like that I was beginning to unravel their network.
24487/0:
24488/0:Maybe that's where Dr. Nassif is hiding out.
24489/0:The Seattle Tarsus Intermediate facility was raided, with numerous casualties.  The extent of the damage is not yet known.
24490/0:High Augur Chen briefed me.
24491/0:You made a big mistake.
24491/1:We don't get paid much, but we can do the job.
24492/0:Good work.
24492/1:Let me do the honors.
24493/0:Good work.
24493/1:Let me do the honors.
24494/0:
24494/1:
24494/2:
24494/3:
24494/4:
24495/0:Who wants him?
24496/0:The JC-Helios AI will be the new government, responsive to every need, large and small.
24497/0:Who wants him?
24498/0:Who wants her?
24499/0:Who wants her?
24500/0:The Omar appreciate shrewd customers.
24501/0:This is what I do with genetic sports.
24501/1:Shouldn't've left your cage...
24502/0:This is what I do with genetic sports.
24502/1:Shouldn't've left your cage...
24503/0:Finish it off.
24504/0:I'm new to Seattle -- I didn't know who you were.
24505/0:I did what I had to do.
24506/0:They lied to me!
24507/0:She bears many tools and much anger.
24508/0:No response yet from the Order.  Anti-WTO rioting broke out for the third time recently at the Panzerwerks factory in Trier.  Many blame Order agitators for the violence.
24509/0:Been here a long time, gave me a chance to pretty the place up, with my paintings.
24510/0:You can do it with a nanite swell.  The particles absorb kinetic energy, which is then emitted as light.  By the time I arrived, though, the glow had subsided, so our choppers had no warning and crossed into the zone too quickly.
24511/0:Be very careful of the sleeping children.  You do NOT want to wake them up.  They're always hungry.
24511/1:GOD ALMIGHTY, WATCH OUT FOR THOSE HATS!!
24511/2:Why doesn't this save the fucking text?  Motherfucker!
24511/3:JUMPIN' JEHOSEPHAT!!!
24512/0:The vent shaft... good idea.  You might be able to avoid the creatures altogether.
24513/0:Finish it off.
24514/0:(grunt)
24514/1:(grunt)
24514/2:(grunt)
24515/0:The SSC just stormed into the school and hauled the Headmaster away.
24516/0:(grunt)
24516/1:(grunt)
24516/2:(grunt)
24517/0:Forward!  Now!
24517/1:Attack!
24517/2:Yeah!  Move in!
24518/0:Forward!  Now!
24518/1:Attack!
24518/2:Yeah!  Move in!
24519/0:We can take him!
24520/0:We can take him!
24521/0:We can take her!
24522/0:Sources tell us that a formal acceptance speech from Her Holiness is imminent.
24523/0:We can take her!
24524/0:Welcome to the Order sanctuary for this city, Alex D.  We've been expecting you.
24525/0:Let's get outta here!
24525/1:Forget it!  Back up!
24525/2:Pull back!
24526/0:Hey!  Pit's off-limits!
24527/0:Don't presume to tell the Minister of Culture how to treat young talent.  I have my own plans for the pretty little fool.
24528/0:
24529/0:Human society is now so destructive that organic life itself is an endangered species.
24530/0:(laugh)  About three hours behind, if my clock is right.  I now know where the teleporter takes its passengers.  My people are closing in on JC's sanctuary this very second.
24531/0:There was a strike.  The workers demanded improved security, but it quickly turned into a riot.
24532/0:
24532/1:
24532/2:
24532/3:
24533/0:What does ApostleCorp need creatures like you for?
24534/0:I'll be ready.  Just say the word.
24535/0:Just give a shout with the beacon when it's time for me to land.
24536/0:Nothing unusual about that.  SSC gives clients a say about who ends up working for them.
24537/0:Lost my big toe to a greasel a couple years ago.  I was a little drunk, and it came at me from underneath a dumpster.
24538/0:Welcome, my friend.
24539/0:Let's get outta here!
24539/1:Forget it!  Back up!
24539/2:Pull back!
24540/0:Spread out!
24540/1:Get around to the other side!
24541/0:Thanks.
24542/0:Spread out!
24542/1:Get around to the other side!
24543/0:
24543/1:
24544/0:Surround him!
24544/1:Keep him guessin'!  He can't defend himself from all sides.
24545/0:Surround him!
24545/1:Keep him guessin'!  He can't defend himself from all sides.
24546/0:Surround her!
24546/1:Keep her guessin'!  She can't defend herself from all sides.
24547/0:No, globally.  We're taking these summit preparations very seriously.  You and the other delegates will be able to conduct your business without any distractions.
24548/0:It seems Chairman Dumier has more confidence in you than in SSC.  I've been instructed to give you the key to the courtyard gate so that you can attempt to locate Her Holiness.
24549/0:Guess it's my lucky night.  Gob-zilla got cooked in her own cage.  Snake-eyes blew it, but wait and see.  No lap-lizard named the Claw's gonna hold the title for long.
24550/0:Surround her!
24550/1:Keep her guessin'!  She can't defend herself from all sides.
24551/0:Any hops during the next twenty-four hours, just fifty percent more than the going rate for one hop.  You can't beat that in this market.  [750 credits.]
24552/0:Let's move.  Take it slow.
24552/1:Stay close...
24552/2:Go.  Wait!  Yes, go.  Just a little ways.
24552/3:Careful -- one step at a time.
24553/0:Know where I can get a decent pilot?
24554/0:Let's move.  Take it slow.
24554/1:Stay close...
24554/2:Go.  Wait!  Yes, go.  Just a little ways.
24554/3:Careful -- one step at a time.
24555/0:Did I do something wrong?
24556/0:Alex D. of Tarsus Academy.  You are alive.
24557/0:Not going to let you by this time, Alex.  I didn't know you were so squeamish about combat, until I saw how you handled Antarctica.  You said you'd kill me but I guess you didn't have the heart.  This time we'll finish it.
24558/0:
24559/0:Isn't it awful?  Can you believe the Mechanics Union -- or whoever it was -- thinks they can kill a world leader and get away with it?
24560/0:JC Denton was the man responsible for the Collapse -- what good would it do to revive him?  Don't let ApostleCorp or the Illuminati use you as a pawn.  One wants to worship JC and the other wants to try to control him.  Neither group can see he's too mad and too powerful for either.  I'm going to destroy him while he's still weak -- it's the only sane answer.  
24561/0:I'm just here to make sure the crowd doesn't get too rowdy.
24562/0:My poor baby...
24563/0:Someone like NG Resonance probably wants to see a credit chit with a lot of bits in it.
24564/0:A Templar?  No.
24565/0:Something to do with "purification..."  Some group called the "Templars..."  I couldn't make sense of it, but I'm fairly certain that he didn't mean expulsion when he mentioned terminating students...  You can see for yourself.
24566/0:She's a human being, for God's sake.
24567/0:The colored light is holographic in nature, just a way to intimidate intruders.  The laser beams themselves are invisible.
24568/0:No new gods.  Got it.
24569/0:Sorry... I got into an argument with my travel agent.  Just tell me.
24570/0:
24571/0:I can't believe you turned against us like this.
24572/0:I was trying to find out what happened to the missing students.
24573/0:I took care of the security bot.  It's safe for you to make a run for the medina.
24574/0:God dammit.  Here's your money.  But tell your boss I need that shipment, and I need it now.
24575/0:It took several days before peace returned to the streets of Seattle, but there were no further disturbances afterward, although some of the tension lingers.
24576/0:I did the job.  Ready to settle up?
24577/0:
24578/0:Panzerwerks bonuses are an insult.  The Order is taking on the corrupt management on behalf of labor, hurting NO ONE, only damaging machines.
24579/0:That's impossible.  The arcology's been seized by Templar paladins.
24580/0:Five to one he's at the Greasel Pit bar, trying earn back his fine by betting on the fights.
24581/0:Who is the woman?
24582/0:An eye for an eye...
24583/0:
24584/0:Would you like to make a purchase?
24585/0:
24586/0:Unclear.  One of their commanders was facing trial, and I guess Templar extremism appealed to some of our Seekers.  The Church seems to be losing ground in disadvantaged neighborhoods, where the poor are quick to join any cause that makes them feel powerful.
24587/0:I'm glad you're all right.
24588/0:Trier's just been a circus lately.
24589/0:You can?
24590/0:It's nice when people actually follow regulations.
24591/0:The Championship match can get kinda mean.  You don't want to watch if you have a weak stomach.
24592/0:Please, listen to me.  The secrecy of our organization is vital, not just to you, but to the billions of people who will be affected by our research.
24593/0:Get some rest.  Cairo is not as friendly as it was when you left it.
24594/0:Seattle should have their WTO charter revoked for how poorly they're handling this.
24595/0:The body must be dead, or we won't be certain of our enemy's fate.
24596/0:I'll have to find a buyer for the jet.
24597/0:Miss Sak's in the office by the landing pad... so that she can keep an eye on her property.
24598/0:So far, so good.
24599/0:There's got to be some way to outsmart a camera.
24600/0:Nothing personal.
24601/0:Tarsus Tracking Report 1242 -- Klara Sparks.  Subject eliminated in Cairo.  She'd allied herself with the WTO, who'd placed her high in the ranks, owing to her abilities.  Intel suggests that Dumier had recognized her special attributes as well, and seemed to be treating her as a special protege, but apparently even that was not enough to protect her from righteous termination.
24602/0:I wish EVERYONE could be that civilized when they get mugged. 
24603/0:My bird sunk to the bottom.  Luckily, though, I'm in good shape.  I swam over a mile to get to shore.
24604/0:Billie -- what are you doing?  We all got the same orders, get out of the facility through Nassif's office.
24605/0:You have permission to pass.
24606/0:Tarsus Tracking Report 1351 -- Leo Jankowski.  Last seen in Cairo, among the Omar.  First assassination attempt, unsuccessful.  He is still alive.  Unclear, the nature of his relationship with the cyborgs.  Appears to be a simple mercenary, but the Omar will study his biomod technology.  Recommend upgrade to Omar threat classification.
24607/0:But if you really must see for yourself, I can't stop you, as long as you have your access pass.  You did remember to bring it, didn't you?  We can't have random visitors wandering through.
24608/0:Then be sure you talk to Chief Morgan as soon as you can.  She's in Europe right now, but she'll address you from the holocomm in her office.  Go up the stairs, hang a right, and look for the management wing on your left.
24609/0:Lucky they didn't go after the air terminal.  I'm supposed to pick someone up.
24610/0:Who are you -- Brett Steed?  You recording this for Talk Bullet?  Attorney-client privilege, my friend.  Get used to it.
24611/0:Once the WTO works through its security problems, I think we'll have a world-class business center here.
24612/0:A tissue scan, please.  The biological properties could be used to improve Omar adaptability.  Or would you prefer to make a purchase now?
24613/0:Cracking good work.  Then I'll see you at the landing pad.  You can pay me when you're ready to fly.
24614/0:Better late than never.  I'm glad to see you snapped out of the Templars' spell.
24615/0:She and Mr. Dumier knew that it would be too hard to pull together a global government from the chaos of the Collapse.  They chose to reinvent specific aspects of power and then bring them together later into one body.
24616/0:
24617/0:Thanks, I'll take the Ammo Scavenger.
24618/0:I'm responsible for the plant, you know.  I don't want things getting screwed up.
24619/0:
24620/0:Whatever.  Pequod's beans go through a far more selective process.  It's a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for.
24621/0:After all the time and money we put into your training, you could at least have protected my scientists.  The Order terrorists just took them out.
24622/0:Sorry.  I don't know anything about what's going on in there.
24623/0:Sorry -- just trying not to get left behind.
24624/0:Rumor has it the Order was involved in some kind of raid..
24625/0:
24626/0:Number Two -- you stay in the VIP lounge.  No snooping around club offices.
24627/0:We're not exactly sure what went wrong, but there are some radical cells within the Order that want to take more extreme measures.  They certainly don't represent the Order as a whole.  
24628/0:Is this a prank call or something?  Funny way to meet people.
24629/0:You can pass.
24630/0:I wish it could be that way, baby.
24631/0:I've already tracked Dr. Nassif to Cairo.
24632/0:You have to be careful of your loyalties in the post-Collapse world.  That is the secret to success.
24633/0:These bots are for JC's protection.  Help me restore them, and maybe we will be able to trust each other again.
24634/0:Then you are barred from entry.
24635/0:Irredeemable.  You are absolutely irredeemable.  Prepare yourself for the grave.
24636/0:Nassif owes us an explanation.  For everything.
24637/0:I just want to get back to Old Cairo.
24638/0:Quit playing games.  QueeQueg's?  That flavorless brown slop?  She just ordered a tall Pequachino from ME!
24639/0:I said beat it.
24640/0:Why do I get the feeling I'm being used?
24641/0:Don't worry about me.  You go first, and I'll meet you there.
24642/0:If this is what it takes for Purity to finally win, then so be it.
24643/0:Positive.
24644/0:I'll be here if you need me.
24645/0:The survival of ApostleCorp -- and JC's hope for society -- depend on what you do in Antarctica.
24646/0:I wish Nicolette could have lived to see this day.  We used to say that if we couldn't have a family we would adopt.  The joke was that we were going to adopt the population of the entire planet.
24647/0:
24648/0:Meanwhile, all hell has broken loose at the Panzerwerks factory.
24649/0:The Arcology is serious about enforcing security.  There's no way in without an official passcode.
24650/0:She has machines, weapons...  She has hate.  She intends to destroy JC and all who stand in her way.  Do not let this come to pass.
24651/0:Toxicity and radiation levels are now within safe limits.
24652/0:You are modified.  Yes.  But only the Omar understand the true purpose of biomodification.
24653/0:
24654/0:Then get lost.
24655/0:I changed my mind.
24656/0:Tell it to the Chief.
24657/0:Cindy... Lovely girl.  Kind of a faffer to live with, though.
24658/0:Without Aquinas, they will be powerless.  Their followers lack conviction -- even you, the hand-picked Guardian of their Republics.
24659/0:They've got you so scared you might as well already be wearing the cortical interface.
24660/0:
24661/0:I hope you're right.
24662/0:Didn't know you were such a futurist.
24663/0:I changed my mind.
24664/0:You aren't cleared to enter the landing bay, Alex.  Get out of there.  My people are in the middle of a very important investigation.
24665/0:We share your condemnation of the WTO, but we prefer less violent solutions, whenever possible.
24666/0:JC will stop these Hateful Ones, make us safe once more.
24667/0:Turn your attention away from creation toward that which is uncreated. Ignore the humanmade hierarchies and material miseries.  As you achieve this state of consciousness you will achieve samadhi and be ecstatically transported outside the bounds and limits imposed upon your spirit by today's society's terrible disorder.
24668/0:I'm not thirsty right now.
24669/0:Incidentally, I have recently found reason to doubt Miss Klara Sparks' loyalty.  We are depending on YOU, Alex.  Only a Denton or one of the trainees can use the Gate.
24670/0:You don't know how much this means to us.  It could save her life...  [5 credits]
24671/0:I don't know how many more times I can stand answering the same questions.
24672/0:
24673/0:So?
24674/0:You can instantly interrupt the function of an assailant's nervous system, rendering him immobile - but without terminating him, releasing you from any untidy liabilities, just in case your trigger finger was a little itchy.
24675/0:I'm new to Seattle -- I didn't know who you were.
24676/0:The WTO's surveillance policies are spelled out in the Charter, in case you have any questions.  Please report your findings on Tarsus to the local SSC office, located on Level 108.  They're authorized to disburse a reward.
24677/0:The Templars have taken the Mosque.  A handful of people may be trapped inside.  The paladins are indifferent to them, but the security bot will shoot any non-Templars.  If you eliminated the bot, the people could probably escape.
24678/0:I guess to you Paul was just another clone.  Now so are you.  I hope you like being alone.
24679/0:I have something I need to take care of first.
24680/0:Yeah...  They're just worried about those two who went missing.  Me?  I don't really care one way or the other.  Just means less competition for me.
24681/0:Guess you're probably here to deal with the hostage situation.
24682/0:Here, take this biomod canister.  It may turn the tide in your favor.
24683/0:What's the name?  I've been to Trier many times.
24684/0:Are there more of you caged here?
24685/0:We cannot allow them to prevail.
24686/0:So I find that interesting.  Do you need a pilot?  I can land my helicopter in the courtyard in front of the SSC station.
24687/0:I believe it, but the Grand Master will track down their other leaders and eliminate the organization completely.  I have faith in him.
24688/0:Is the procedure dangerous?
24689/0:If you want to know more, you've got to do the real snooping yourself.
24690/0:Wanna make some money?  You a gambler?
24691/0:
24692/0:You're listed as a material witness in a criminal case filed by the Order Church.
24693/0:
24694/0:Toward oneness.  Toward union with earth and spirit.  Toward inmost Order.
24695/0:Between SSC watches and the security systems, Tarsus is as safe as it can be.
24696/0:I guess they figured nobody would go looking for laboratories under an old Roman fortification.
24697/0:I want human affairs to be driven by wisdom.  Finding the correct recipe for wisdom has been my project these long years under the ice.
24698/0:Our admiration to all those inside and out of protected enclaves.  Together, we face each uncertain day with resolve and courage.
24699/0:My luck's about dried up in this town, if you want to know the truth.
24700/0:Of course.  I'll transfer the standard informant's bonus.  Hey -- and you should come see me sing.  I'll put you down for a free ticket -- good for any NG Resonance show foreign or domestic.
24701/0:What do you want?  My life story?
24702/0:The Inclinator has been shut down because of a toxic spill.  They've deployed bots to secure the area.
24703/0:zxczxczxc
24704/0:Very well.
24705/0:What a night.
24706/0:
24707/0:
24708/0:Ask for a new reason to be locked up for two years?  No.  Come!  I am going!
24709/0:
24710/0:Oh, I know quite well who the Minister is -- and how he likes to do business.  I've been trying to catch his eye.  Tell him I'll meet him at his penthouse in about an hour.
24711/0:I won't revel in a QueeQueg's bankruptcy, but it would be good for consumers.
24712/0:Rewards can be granted only for information related to a crime.
24713/0:Thanks for the warm welcome.
24714/0:Good, you found the facility.  Transmit the specification to the WTO orbiting science platform, Ophelia, then you will be free to kill that self-styled Savior, J.C. Denton.
24715/0:I hope the headmaster doesn't find out about this place.
24716/0:Never fear.  Mr. Denton has nothing more to accomplish here.  The data is safe, and our forces should be on the move.  Be proud, paladins, we're about to make history!
24717/0:
24718/0:It's for real, then?  You came through?  My lawyer just called a minute ago -- I thought he was kidding.
24719/0:She has machines, weapons...  She has hate.  She intends to destroy JC and all who stand in her way.  Do not let this come to pass.
24720/0:
24720/1:
24720/2:
24720/3:
24721/0:I tried to work up a system for the commodities market, but it turns out my talent's more for general trends than specifics.
24722/0:Go on, I'm interested in doing business.  I've heard you know where I can find a cure for the plague.
24723/0:I don't care if the director hired you -- she doesn't have the authority to send anyone into this mess.  The WTO is handling the situation now.  We've got bots patrolling, which I can't reprogram at this stage.  There's no way we can guarantee anyone's safety under these conditions.
24724/0:
24725/0:You may pass.
24726/0:The payment first, please.
24727/0:This chick wants to talk to you about Sid.
24728/0:Do you have time for a brief survey?
24729/0:Never heard of him.
24730/0:Mr. Dumier will remain in the protected compartment -- for his own safety.
24731/0:This is a weapons-free zone.  To enter, you must submit to a deactivation procedure --  I'll transmit the encrypted safety-lock bytecodes to freeze all your weapons, on or in your person.  When you leave, sensors will reactivate everything you've got.
24732/0:Are you sure?
24733/0:A lot of pretty phrases flying around, but it's all about one thing: money.
24734/0:Later, babe.
24735/0:Welcome, Alex.  I see that you're awake.
24736/0:Go on.
24737/0:Nicolette was right -- to reshape history, all you need are a few carefully chosen ideas.
24738/0:The individual worker -- careerist, let's say -- seldom understands how his small labor contributes to human history.  Seemingly innocuous innovations in cell biology, nanotechnology, and computer science add up to a teeming substrate of new life.  But it isn't life.  It's death.  It seeks to devour its clumsy, organic creators.
24739/0:I'm listening.
24740/0:You must be wondering if there is a connection between this attack and Chicago.  I don't think so.
24741/0:You have a generous heart.  You would make a good Seeker, but Order has many enemies, and often appeasement only prolongs a problem.  You can find Sid Black at the Greasel Pit bar if you want to give him the good news about his jet.
24742/0:Alex, I'm here.  I took cover in the comm van by the UNATCO ruins.  Let's talk.  Time to decide who we're gonna bring down first.
24743/0:Our facility in Trier provides more than half the population of the city with jobs they can be proud of -- the production of bots, from security grade to military level.  Helping to keep the world safe.
24744/0:We are waiting.
24745/0:
24746/0:Disgusting....
24747/0:More uptown feebs every day...
24748/0:Leave me alone.
24749/0:
24750/0:What's it look like in there?
24751/0:
24752/0:Maybe later.
24753/0:For a second I thought you were that guy who runs the Pequod's Coffeeshop downstairs.  The fool thinks that if he attacks me with a goofy grin I'll convince NG to endorse the franchise.
24754/0:The Headmaster has this bizarre secret office, with files on all the students and communications with someone outside Tarsus.
24755/0:Don't worry -- I'm outta here as soon as the Inclinator's back in business.
24756/0:Don't disappoint us like your classmate, Miss Sparks.  This was her mission, but she wouldn't follow through.  Chief Morgan took her into custody and will handle the transport out of the arcology.  Pay attention, Alex.  I'm through sweet-talking you trainees.  Do as we say or your traitorous friend dies.
24757/0:You can salvage nothing from that facility, because the conspriators are dead.  You must go to the Statue and destroy the Denton machine.
24758/0:Maybe fly-by was just a prank?  I don't know.  But the WTO doesn't really have a sense of humor about these sorts of things.
24759/0:Are you tired of breathers?  Are you sick of the Plague 11 cough?  Have you had it with dizzy spells?  I want to tell you about an amazing new elixir.
24760/0:Hear that?  She called Red a "punk..."
24761/0:Huh?
24761/1:Eh?
24761/2:Oh?
24762/0:Huh?
24762/1:Eh?
24762/2:Oh?
24763/0:What is this place?
24764/0:Huh?
24764/1:Eh?
24764/2:Oh?
24765/0:Huh?
24765/1:Eh?
24765/2:Oh?
24766/0:Hello?
24766/1:Maybe something's up?
24767/0:Hello?
24767/1:Maybe something's up?
24768/0:
24769/0:Hello?
24769/1:Maybe something's up?
24770/0:I believe in dialogue -- don't get me wrong.  But it takes more than words to win over the hearts of the people.
24771/0:Hello?
24771/1:Maybe something's up?
24772/0:There it is again.
24772/1:I wonder what that's about.
24773/0:There it is again.
24773/1:I wonder what that's about.
24774/0:Yes indeed... I want to stay on their radar.  An ex-Pequod's employee told me the code to their safe: 34-45-1-23.  You look like the mercenary type.  Maybe you would like to slip into the arcology and empty it for me.  Your payment would be the contents of the safe.
24775/0:But how could she support the WTO?
24776/0:Surveillance failure.  Taking emergency measures.
24776/1:Unexpected detection.
24777/0:Enemy location unknown.
24777/1:Seeking origin of the assault.
24778/0:
24779/0:Unexpected collison.  Processing...
24780/0:
24781/0:Phenomenon unfamiliar.  More analysis required.
24782/0:Enemy tactic identified.
24783/0:Final match is four-to-one odds.  Buy-in begins right after this fight, after which the odds stand, even if something happens to one trainer's lineup.
24784/0:
24785/0:Noise deliberate.  Disregarding.
24786/0:Tracking creature disturbance.
24787/0:
24788/0:Logging animal corpse.
24789/0:Agent Sparks is one of ours, Alex.  What are you trying to prove?  If I wasn't under direct orders from Chairman Dumier, I would have you detained.
24790/0:Mr. O'Rourke is sleeping.  Try again tomorrow.
24791/0:We don't make the rules.  We just enforce them.
24792/0:
24793/0:Helios is finished.  Destroy the organic component -- Denton.  He is our last significant rival.
24794/0:Miss Withers gave me a call.  Thank you so much.  You did it!
24795/0:We'll be on our toes now, when dealing with the Templars.
24796/0:Hm.  I'll think about it.
24797/0:You're free to pass.
24798/0:You're wrong.  Everything I've built -- including you -- was meant to ensure the survival of humanity.  Like it or not, intelligent life WILL evolve to the next level, with or without us.
24799/0:My sculptures... Oh yes, I have plenty to tell him about my sculptures.
24800/0:Are you the one who designed the Mag Rail?
24801/0:Gotta have a system, know what I'm sayin'?
24802/0:You've got to rescue Paul and fulfill your destiny.
24803/0:Alex D...  You're the last one to arrive.  I suppose that like the others you're after my laboratory and the gateway to JC Denton.
24804/0:A utopia of human-machine superbeings...?  Sounds familiar.
24805/0:Analyzing weapon markings.
24806/0:Investigating device malfunction.
24807/0:
24808/0:Investigating disabled device.
24809/0:If this is what it takes for Purity to finally win, then so be it.
24810/0:Investigating moving object.
24811/0:Investigating missing object.
24812/0:Investigating displaced object.
24813/0:Don't be fooled by the wind -- the dust always comes back.
24814/0:Investigating damaged object.
24815/0:Out of order.
24816/0:Investigating destroyed object.
24817/0:Investigating open door.
24818/0:Investigating closed door.
24819/0:Was it the strikers -- the Panzerwerks union?  I thought they were friends of the Church.
24820/0:EMP grenades are useful, but I don't have the credits. [200]
24821/0:I can't wait to see what the Regional Office has to say.  They told me it was impossible for us to go head-to-head with Pequod's.
24822/0:Well done.  A discount will be applied to all of your business transactions with our agents in Seattle.  Omar agents can be found at the Club Vox VIP suite and on the streets of Lower Seattle.
24823/0:I better get back to work.
24824/0:Protect me from who?
24825/0:Excellent.  My navigation unit has what it needs.  I can land as soon as you're ready.
24826/0:
24827/0:
24828/0:Investigating active light source.
24829/0:You jackass, that was the World Championship.  That stunt just INVALIDATED the whole thing.
24830/0:
24831/0:Investigating inactive light source.
24832/0:t5est.
24833/0:
24834/0:Verified: open.  Investigating activity.
24835/0:Verified: closed.  Investigating activity.
24836/0:Verified: on.  Investigating activity.
24837/0:Verified: off.  Investigating activity.
24838/0:Bet a hundred on Chicken-liver -- five-to-one odds, baby!
24839/0:Huh?
24839/1:Eh?
24839/2:Maybe something's up?
24840/0:Investigating fire.
24841/0:Scanning victim.
24842/0:They'll always need us for their dirty work.  Like my brother Danny.  He cleans the bots that clean the floors up there.  How would he get to work without the Inclinator?
24843/0:Organic fluid detected.
24844/0:What about my money?
24845/0:Rules is rules.
24846/0:There's no reasoning with you, but there's no need to fight either.  Do what you have to.
24847/0:Someday this will all change and you arcology types will be sorry.
24848/0:Well, hurry the hell up.  This is the World Championship about to go down.
24849/0:Alex D.  The information you provided our agent has proven valuable.  He was successful against the invaders and would like to thank you.  Your future business with the Omar will remain on favorable terms.
24850/0:I'll think about it.
24851/0:To hell with an economic shock.  People want the new cities, and they want them now.
24852/0:How do you mean?
24853/0:Sorry.  So how do I know which transgenic to bet on?  They all look the same to me.
24854/0:Ya cleaned me out.  I don't have any more to sell you.
24855/0:What changed your mind?
24856/0:It's safe to leave this platform now.  The spill's been cleaned up.
24857/0:Non-human carcass identified.
24858/0:They really want us to find true balance and order in our lives, which can only be possible when we're not being subjected to secret experiments.  
24859/0:The disappearances are troubling, but I'm sure it will all be resolved soon.
24860/0:Maybe the pre-Collapse government was going to crossbreed a couple of soldiers.  So what?  It's not like they'd ever do that to the general population.
24861/0:
24862/0:Don't think I don't notice things.  People coming and going.  They climb in the dumpster out there and disappear.
24863/0:The Omar do not take such actions lightly.  For this hostile act, all preferred customer privileges are hereby revoked.
24864/0:Make your decision.
24865/0:It's not too late to reform the Church.
24866/0:I trust the Grand Master's vision, but not you.
24867/0:As you wish .. but I assure you that you haven't seen the last of Dr. Nassif.
24868/0:
24869/0:Good luck, bud.
24870/0:
24870/1:
24870/2:
24870/3:
24870/4:
24871/0:What do you suspect is going on?
24872/0:My work could take us beyond anthropomorphic architectures... if only they would let me collaborate with other engineers.
24873/0:Hey, buddy.  I just heard from Eddie downstairs.  He can stall a little while longer if you need more time to... you know.
24874/0:Yes -- and one of our best captains, too.  The Templars appear to be assembling an army of mercenaries -- and maybe those stories about Parisian gold are true.  They seem to have very deep pockets.
24875/0:
24876/0:
24877/0:And those were your last words.
24878/0:The trader handles business.  I am here to prevent unfair transactions.
24879/0:Dr. Nassif, how are you doing in the middle of all this?
24880/0:Quite an uninhibited young fellow, aren't you?
24881/0:Yeah, he told me where to find you.
24882/0:Won't be long before one cult or another tries to force itself on EVERYBODY.  You better drink to that, young miss.
24883/0:
24884/0:I'm not shedding any tears over Headmaster Archer, but you should notify the SSC about him so that they can take care of the situation.  There is a security kiosk on this level outside the school.
24885/0:We're not exactly sure what went wrong, but there are some radical cells within the Order that want to take more extreme measures.  They certainly don't represent the Order as a whole.  
24886/0:Like I always say, bet on the trainer.  Something dirty went down tonight -- that's why Gob-zilla didn't show, but the best trainer always comes out on top.
24887/0:I can't believe we're going to surrender the arcology, but I'm not complaining.
24888/0:Excellent work.  Without that machine, ApostleCorp's agenda is finished, and the Templars have no means to disperse their counternanite.
24889/0:Too late.  The WTO already has the schematic.  Besides, we wanted the scientist DEAD.
24890/0:Perhaps, someday, they'll be ready, and we'll finally be able to reveal our efforts.
24891/0:
24892/0:You felt a spark of curiosity and gave in to impulse.
24893/0:Your little blips of thought -- "bullets," indeed.  You and your kind have murdered the human intellect with momentary impulses, the noise of the machine, seeping into every mind...
24894/0:Don't be ridiculous.  We can handle one Order Seeker.
24895/0:Not long before we're the superstars here, I'm sure.
24896/0:I've risked my neck for less.  I'll think about it.
24897/0:Just wait.  Templars gonna have their day.
24898/0:If Her Holiness thinks she can put us all into a great pre-Collapse wealth-making machine, she must think she's a god.
24899/0:No matter what happens to me, the aspirations of ApostleCorp will live on.  I've made sure of that.
24900/0:Maybe.  New Cairo has changed recently.
24901/0:
24902/0:Is he that bad?
24903/0:Murderer not found.
24904/0:Engagement unresolved.  Archiving data.
24905/0:Intrusion unresolved.  Archiving data.
24906/0:Failure to locate the thief.
24907/0:Scan inconclusive.
24907/1:Clear.  Downgrading alert.
24908/0:Archer's door is always open.
24909/0:Luminon Saman -- where are you?
24910/0:Meteorologists have detected a weather anomaly in New York City, that appears to be centering on Liberty Island.
24911/0:Are you another of JC's gone bad?  We did not like the last one's questions.  She works with these intruders.  And now she's gone through the gate to our home, in Antarctica.
24912/0:
24913/0:No time.  You better scout the area.
24914/0:Be careful -- I'm reading a Templar guard on patrol nearby. Are you ready for a direct confrontation? If not, maybe those boxes could be of some use, as cover, or maybe as a distraction....
24915/0:

24915/7:
24916/0:Don't blink, muchacha.
24917/0:Emergency lockdown in progress.
24918/0:No need to worry abou those kids.  The headmaster runs a pretty tight ship over there.
24919/0:I found the beacon and activated it.
24920/0:My lawyer knows how to prosecute pushy fanboys.
24921/0:I love Nature as much as Her Holiness.  But Nature builds and creates.  Perhaps the Order is sincere, but they have a public relations battle to win.
24922/0:Every minute the Inclinator is offline, we're ALL losing money.  Think about that.
24923/0:Before the Collapse, Helios was the entity that managed the Aquinas Network.
24924/0:Seeking additional combat units.
24925/0:Threat scheduled for elimination.
24926/0:Alex D.  Who are you?
24927/0:Retreating.
24928/0:I don't know where he is, but he better show up soon.  The facility here is being raided by the Templars.  So far we're holding our own, but I don't know how much longer that will last.  This may be my last transmission...
24929/0:Pursuing directional scan.  High probability of identifying target.
24929/1:Enemy activity verified.  Ready for engagement.
24930/0:Negative.
24930/1:All surveillance heuristics normal.
24931/0:Responding.
24931/1:Target acquired.
24932/0:Authorized.  Proceed.
24933/0:Destroying lifeform.
24934/0:Acknowledged.
24935/0:Target reacquired.
24936/0:No weaponry detected.
24937/0:Huh?
24937/1:Ommmm... Omm -- erkg? //interrupted meditation
24937/2:I'm ready for anything.
24938/0:Analyzing evasive tactic.
24939/0:Huh?
24939/1:Ommmm... Omm -- erkg? //interrupted meditation
24940/0:Target retreating.
24940/1:Enemy position taken.
24941/0:Need to stay focused.  Pay more attention.
24941/1:I sense... disorder.
24941/2:Like a chill down my spine...
24942/0:The leader of the Cairo facility... captured by the Templars.
24943/0:Thanks.  I'll keep that in mind.
24944/0:Enemy targeting error.
24944/1:Attack evaded.  Continuing.
24945/0:Damage sustained.
24945/1:Analyzing system disruption.
24946/0:Danger.  Hull integrity failing.
24946/1:Circuit damage.  Survivability reduced. 
24947/0:Systems failing.
24947/1:Hull plates vulnerable.
24948/0:I guess we're going to pull through.
24949/0:Yes -- superstars.  Miss Withers, the manager for NG Resonance, just ordered a tall Pequachino on ice.  You heard that NG is having a concert here tomorrow -- right?
24950/0:Be careful of the automated turrets around here.  They're on a hair trigger.
24951/0:Just fight, you dog!
24952/0:Maskini Nassif asked me to look for his daughter, Eeva.  He's very worried.  Is that you?
24953/0:She's a liar and a fake.  And so are you.
24954/0:Wait -- You're just going to leave without searching?  Don't you want to know what's really going on?  If they're really innocent, Tarsus and Nassif have no reason to hide anything from us.
24955/0:
24955/1:
24956/0:All I need you to do is destroy the machine inside the Statue.  It might still fall into the wrong hands.
24957/0:I deserve to be put back in the field, to tell the truth.  I proved today how little I understand the current tactical environment.
24958/0:Sure you don't want me to mark the guards on your map?
24959/0:Well!  They say WE'RE intolerant -- hmp!
24960/0:Need to stay focused.  Pay more attention.
24960/1:I sense... disorder.
24960/2:Like a chill down my spine...
24961/0:Whatever's going on, we can handle it.
24961/1:Did you say something?
24962/0:Whatever's going on, we can handle it.
24962/1:Did you say something?
24963/0:I keep hearing things.
24963/1:The more I hear that.... 
24964/0:Extreme heat.  Compensating.
24965/0:I keep hearing things.
24965/1:The more I hear that.... 
24966/0:He's been hit pretty hard.  Mr. Kurczec wasn't the only one who was killed.
24967/0:I keep thinking I saw something...
24967/1:I could've sworn... Nah, I'm just seeing things.
24968/0:Negligible damage.
24968/1:Enemy ineffective.
24969/0:I keep thinking I saw something...
24969/1:I could've sworn... Nah, I'm just seeing things.
24970/0:Targeting accurate.
24970/1:Ranged weapon successful.
24971/0:There it goes again...
24971/1:Again?  That's really strange.
24971/2:This is starting to get old.
24972/0:Target eliminated.
24972/1:Successful battle logged for analysis.
24972/2:Countermeasures successful.
24973/0:There it goes again...
24973/1:Again?  That's really strange.
24973/2:This is starting to get old.
24974/0:Is this another drill?
24974/1:What's that?
24974/2:I'm on my toes now.  I'll see what's the matter.
24975/0:Targeting.
24976/0:Coordinating with additional unit.
24977/0:Summoning additional units.
24978/0:Hi, Alex!  Hurry!  Come to my concert near the Pequod's coffeeshop!
24979/0:I need to calm down.
24980/0:They really want us to find true balance and order in our lives, which can only be possible when we're not being subjected to secret experiments.  
24981/0:Why did you turn against JC?
24982/0:If I give you guys some money, will you leave this guy alone?  [100 credits]
24983/0:Me and NG?  We both grew up misunderstood.
24984/0:That's very kind.  (sniffle)  But unless you're on the admissions committee at the academy -- or unless you're someone who can hack in and put "Mina Ameer" on the acceptance list, there's not really much to do except wait and pray.
24985/0:You're startin' to sound like a rookie.  Sak isn't exactly discreet.  When it comes to clientele, SSC should have better standards.
24986/0:I never get tired of talking to my fans.
24987/0:
24988/0:The counter-agent sounds like something that would interest the villagers.  How do I get into this facility?
24989/0:
24990/0:I could fight you, I guess, but okay.  How 'bout I give you a down payment on a leather jacket if you tell me about this Mr. P. [50]
24991/0:Is this another drill?
24991/1:What's that?
24992/0:Safeness again.
24993/0:I'm going to get to the bottom of this.
24993/1:This better not be a prank.
24993/2:... thought you could sneak up on ME.  
24993/3:Who's here? 
24993/4:That better be my relief coming...
24994/0:I'm going to get to the bottom of this.
24994/1:This better not be a prank.
24994/2:... thought you could sneak up on ME.  
24995/0:We might have company.
24995/1:What's that now?  We have to check this out.
24996/0:Summoning medical bot.
24997/0:We might have company.
24997/1:What's that now?  We have to check this out.
24998/0:Summoning repair bot.
24999/0:That definitely doesn't sound right.
24999/1:Now I know I heard THAT.
25000/0:Unexpected consequence of action.  Reviewing sequence.
25001/0:That definitely doesn't sound right.
25001/1:Now I know I heard THAT.
25002/0:In Antarctica, you helped our kind.  JC tells us you are his ally as well.  We welcome you.
25003/0:Pathway blocked.
25004/0:That sure doesn't look right.
25004/1:I'd swear I saw... well, there's only one way to find out.
25005/0:Doorway blocked.
25006/0:That sure doesn't look right.
25006/1:I'd swear I saw... well, there's only one way to find out.
25007/0:Explosive deployed.
25008/0:This is NO drill.
25008/1:So much for a stealthy approach, eh?
25008/2:You're not going to get past me.
25009/0:Live explosive detected.
25010/0:Proximity device detected.
25011/0:You reconsidered.  Good.  Helios is already configuring the new Acquinas hub.  Now come to the Statue.  I need a direct interface with your biomodifications in order to structure Helios properly.  To be the center of a civilization, an electronic mind must mirror the intelligences of the citizens.  We will be the models.
25012/0:Targeting error.
25012/1:Failure to damage target.  Evaluating...
25013/0:Termination authorized.
25013/1:Accessing tactical database.
25014/0:Headquarters made it clear -- no exceptions.
25015/0:They think they can hide their technology from the Harvester.  They are wrong.
25016/0:No problem.
25017/0:Guess I gotta make do with the Claw.  He's got the experience, but he's no spring chicken anymore.
25018/0:Economics.  That's why the WTO will always be on top.
25019/0:
25020/0:Lies!  I tell you -- the Church is the work of cynical conspirators.
25021/0:What's really monstrous is the way these children are being hopelessly polluted.  We can't allow humanity to damage itself like this.
25022/0:We humans are the ones who have declared war against THEM.
25023/0:It was a pleasure doing business.
25024/0:I'll keep that in mind.
25025/0:That's a serious detachment.
25026/0:I bet you think this is a big joke.
25027/0:This is NO drill.
25027/1:So much for a stealthy approach, eh?
25027/2:You're not going to get past me.
25028/0:Can't get nothin' from ME.  I'm all washed up.
25029/0:We've got company.
25029/1:What were you thinking, messing with us?
25030/0:We've got company.
25030/1:What were you thinking, messing with us?
25031/0:You can't escape.
25031/1:You're just making this worse on yourself.
25031/2:(to self) Some damn fool... needs a lesson in respect.
25031/3:You can't hide for long!
25032/0:A picket-line in the Lower City.  I was standing point at the entrance to the Inclinator.  Some beggar dove under the platform and tried to climb up into the enclave.
25033/0:Mission success highly probable.
25033/1:Tactics successful.
25034/0:You can't escape.
25035/0:Biomods detected.
25035/1:Target employing biomod technology.
25036/0:Gah!
25036/1:By Her Holiness!?
25037/0:Gah!
25037/1:By Her Holiness!?
25038/0:I guess I was imagining things.
25038/1:Huh?  Must be time for a break. 
25039/0:Enemy moves at trans-human speed.
25040/0:I guess I was imagining things.
25040/1:Huh?  Must be time for a break. 
25041/0:(bleep)
25041/1:(static)
25041/2:(pops)
25042/0:Just random sounds, I guess.
25042/1:I'm just jumping at every pointless sound...
25043/0:You'll be safe in the WTO enclave.  Whatever you do, don't go down the Inclinator into Lower Seattle.  The Order terrorists are strong there.
25044/0:Target assessment: vulnerable.  Proceeding.
25044/1:Calculating mission risk.... negligible.
25045/0:Combat situation irregular.  Analyzing...
25045/1:Re-calculating mission risk.... acceptable.
25046/0:Combat situation unfavorable.  Reviewing alternatives.
25046/1:Mission jeopardized.
25047/0:So I've got one, too.  The Omar network informed me of your assault.
25048/0:I think you know how to stand around and look pathetic.
25049/0:As the time for the first ever WTO-Order summit draws near, Vera Maxwell, the Executive Commander of the SSC, runs through final preparations and strategies.
25050/0:
25051/0:So you're fully engineered transgenics, not aliens.  That was just a cover story for a Cold War research project.  But there aren't very many of you -- hardly an army.
25052/0:Good work.
25053/0:The Illuminati have always sought just one thing -- centralization.  Centralization of wealth, power, and ideology.  The implementation details are unimportant.
25054/0:
25055/0:Well... to tell you the truth, I was leading up to hiring you.  I don't mind paying for a job like that.
25056/0:
25057/0:Just random sounds, I guess.
25057/1:I'm just jumping at every pointless sound...
25058/0:Maybe it was an otherworldly vision...  Her Holiness trying to tell me something?
25058/1:Did I see... ?  Nah...
25059/0:Maybe it was an otherworldly vision...  Her Holiness trying to tell me something?
25059/1:Did I see... ?  Nah...
25060/0:Slow down, kiddo!  Lots of juice running through these transformers.
25061/0:Someone was poking around, but the area's clear now.
25061/1:I guess I scared that trespasser off.
25062/0:You made it in.  Now start searching her apartment.  Maybe there's a datacube or something...
25063/0:Someone was poking around, but the area's clear now.
25063/1:I guess I scared that trespasser off.
25064/0:...just a hit and run.
25064/1:It looks like it's safe around here now.
25065/0:...just a hit and run.
25065/1:It looks like it's safe around here now.
25066/0:That's easy for an outsider to say.  If I don't weigh the consequences the city might get sued -- or I could lose my job.
25067/0:I guess the murderer fled.
25067/1:I got the job done, and chased off that bloodthirsty miscreant.
25068/0:I guess the murderer fled.
25068/1:I got the job done, and chased off that bloodthirsty miscreant.
25069/0:Some machines were damaged, but no living beings were harmed.
25070/0:That burglar got smart and left.
25070/1:I must have intimidated that foolish thief, because the area's clear now.
25071/0:What do you think she'll do?
25072/0:Never mess around with the boss's son, or else you end up with an assignment like this.
25073/0:Thanks.  That's very thoughtful.
25074/0:Who next?
25075/0:Wish I had more cash.  I'd bet more.  [500 credits.]
25076/0:What about the VIP membership?
25077/0:Ready to fly?
25078/0:Destroy a whole city -- for one laboratory?
25079/0:
25080/0:Without pain, what use would we have for religion?
25081/0:Mmm, what do I see?  An exceptional young man.  Modified, correct?  Lovingly grown in an enclave -- and now you step into the dangerous world.
25082/0:
25083/0:I will be ready.  Thank you.
25084/0:
25085/0:I don't think so.
25086/0:Looks pretty rough down there.  Pity you couldn't afford a couple of my Sunfire missiles to help you out.  For what it's worth, here's a map of the island.  Later, sweets.  Think I'm gonna rag it over to Times Square to see Erin.
25087/0:I have no enemies, merely topographies of ignorance.  The people drift aimlessly, collecting into clans wherever they find a glimmer of knowledge...
25088/0:Not long before we're the superstars here, I'm sure.
25089/0:You better let me get back to staring at this wall over here.
25090/0:That burglar got smart and left.
25090/1:I must have intimidated that foolish thief, because the area's clear now.
25091/0:I think I saw something...
25091/1:What's that?  It was a blur.
25092/0:I think I saw something...
25092/1:What's that?  It was a blur.
25093/0:I know I saw something...
25093/1:A-ha!
25094/0:
25095/0:I know I saw something...
25095/1:A-ha!
25096/0:I think I just heard something...
25096/1:That's a strange sound...
25097/0:I think I just heard something...
25097/1:That's a strange sound...
25098/0:Okay.  You know where to find me if you change your mind.
25099/0:I just felt something.
25099/1:Oomph.  What was that?
25100/0:QueeQuegs got an early lead in the poorer neighborhoods, but they won't be able to compete for long.
25101/0:My, my... aren't we jealous?
25102/0:Hi, Alex!  Hurry!  Come to my concert near the Pequod's coffeeshop!
25103/0:I just felt something.
25103/1:Oomph.  What was that?
25104/0:(grunt) What just hit me?!
25104/1:(grunt) What was THAT?!
25105/0:Now get to work.
25106/0:
25107/0:JC is waiting.  He needs to establish an Aquinas hub and transmit your profile.  How can I help?
25108/0:
25109/0:
25110/0:
25111/0:News travels fast around here.
25112/0:
25112/1:
25112/2:
25112/3:
25112/4:
25112/5:
25113/0:
25114/0:I hope that Panzerwerks has not done something foolish.
25115/0:Let the WTO handle this disturbance.  Just answer my questions.  Who do you work for?  All non-enclave workers must leave the area until security can be restored.
25116/0:Follow me.
25117/0:It would take thirty years to rebuild what Aquinas can give us in a few days.
25118/0:Verify that our counter-nanite, which we intend to deploy worldwide, can disable the Denton biomod system without destroying the host.  I will have the results by the time you arrive.  Your pilot will have to meet you in Flight Bay 23.  My people have important work to do.
25119/0:
25120/0:Give me the black-market biomod.  [1000]
25121/0:
25122/0:They cannot get the factory under control.  The workers have seized the facility.
25123/0:Anyway...
25124/0:I don't drink it if it's marketed to snobs as a status symbol.
25125/0:(grunt) What just hit me?!
25125/1:(grunt) What was THAT?!
25126/0:We wanted just to be left alone.
25127/0:(whistles)
25127/1:Holy --!
25128/0:(whistles)
25128/1:Holy --!
25129/0:Hmmm...  Foul play.
25129/1:Whoever's responsible can't have gotten far...
25130/0:Hmmm...  Foul play.
25130/1:Whoever's responsible can't have gotten far...
25131/0:Here you go.  Name's Alex D.  [500 credits.]
25132/0:Whoa.  Out cold.
25132/1:Still breathing...
25133/0:Nevermind.  I don't want to go in.
25134/0:Whoa.  Out cold.
25134/1:Still breathing...
25135/0:Orders are orders.  Can't have civilians poking around back here.  I think you should move along.
25136/0:I just spot faces.  They didn't tell me what you did.
25137/0:I have delivered my message.  You will have to wait for Mr. Kirkpatrick.
25138/0:
25139/0:I don't think the two are connected, though.
25140/0:By the time they thaw him out, people won't be people anymore.  They'll be food for microscopic machines.
25141/0:It wasn't exactly easy getting here.
25142/0:
25143/0:My chopper is ready when you are.
25144/0:Just stay out of the way.  Too many patients, no time for chitchat.
25145/0:Good work at the Emerald Suites.  What we need you to do now is check out the Mako facility north of town.  We know they've been doing illegal weapons research and that your former trainer, Dr. Nassif, has contacts there.  You'll need to hire a pilot and leave at once.
25146/0:Chief Engineer.  How'd you get down here?
25147/0:Stop.
25148/0:Thank you.
25149/0:You owe this search for true Order not only to yourself, but also to your fellow humans.  There is a Fard bi al-Kifayah, or collective duty.  You are bound to search and bring the search to others so that all may reach deeper understandings and peace.
25150/0:I investigated the school, but I didn't know I was part of an official operation.
25151/0:Each of them knows in his or her heart that something is still missing -- true order.  And soon, they will begin to seek it, and we will be there to help them.
25152/0:It's okay, Chief Morgan, we can tell him the truth.
25153/0:Excellent.  You've done much to bring peace to this neglected part of the city.  Now go to the Greasel Pit bar and find Sid Black.  I bet he will be happy to take you to Mako.
25154/0:Too bad you weren't in the field when all this trouble started.
25155/0:The raid is going to happen any minute.
25156/0:At least there's always Queequeg's.
25157/0:Ready?
25158/0:However, no plans have been made for a summit meeting.  We are reviewing the Director's proposal and considering how to respond.
25159/0:Here's some money for the door code.  [250 credits.]
25160/0:Report the truth to my seekers -- to true seekers everywhere.  What more would be necessary?
25161/0:Payment please.
25162/0:The idiot didn't follow through, though.  Tina just pumped Gob-zilla's hide full of zyme, and there's my poor Snake-eyes up against Gob-zilla squared.  He won, but man did he take a beating.  What I woulda paid to have the job done right.
25163/0:My first gig -- and I blew it.  Oh God did I blow it!
25164/0:Uh, sorry.
25165/0:Remember -- the WTO wants Dr. Nassif alive so that she can be questioned.  We think she may be holed up behind what remains of the ApostleCorp security system.
25166/0:Move it.
25167/0:Perhaps I am too aggressive, but a society in which everyone understands everyone else is something I think we all should strive for.
25168/0:Everyone is a price.  A price you can get, a price you must pay.  Very simple.
25169/0:History moves in fits and starts.  Obviously you're too young to remember pre-Collapse society.  I watched two centuries of progress vanish during two minutes on the evening news.
25170/0:I just heard something...
25170/1:What was that noise?
25171/0:Huh?  I just felt something.
25172/0:Enough.  You're wearing me out.
25173/0:Ouch.  What hit me?
25174/0:Whoa!  What the--!
25174/1:What is THAT?!
25175/0:Your murder of Paul Denton has prevented us from testing the procedure, however.  My people don't trust you, so expect resistance from my paladins until you prove yourself.  It would be foolish of us to take your word for anything.
25176/0:A body!  ...but still breathing...
25176/1:Someone knocked 'em out cold.
25177/0:Not if you're careful.  Just stick to the shadows, crouch, and move slowly.  You'll come through just fine.
25178/0:We sense... something?
25178/1:Are we not alone?
25179/0:What is going on?
25179/1:(tentative gray quizzical noise)
25180/0:Ha.  Doesn't hurt.
25181/0:We see...?
25181/1:A sight.
25182/0:We hear...?
25182/1:A sound.
25183/0:Again?
25183/1:It repeats.
25184/0:Please step inside.  Join us for meditation.  Her Holiness awaits your presence.
25185/0:Biomodification is more involved than you might imagine, Alex.  This facility was for your protection.
25186/0:The plasmids for the neonatal experiment are off the charts again.  Can you give me a hand with them?
25187/0:
25188/0:And Mako Ballistics is reporting that terrorists have infiltrated their Redmond facility and have stolen the plans for a weapon prototype.  The chief engineer was killed in the attack.
25189/0:
25190/0:
25190/1:
25190/2:
25191/0:Ha ha.
25192/0:Time is short.  You need to locate the Aquinas Specification files under the UNATCO ruins and transmit them to Helios.
25193/0:We sense a disruption.
25193/1:What happens?
25194/0:I don't know how they're going to settle this situation at Panzerwerks.  I hope no one gets hurt.
25195/0:(tentative gray greeting noise)
25195/1:Sense... something...
25196/0:We sense danger.
25196/1:We are alert now.
25197/0:Look after your interests.  The Omar seek reliable customers.
25198/0:Yes, there is danger.
25198/1:We are more aware.
25199/0:Ha-hah!  Snake-eyes BURIED that bug-eyed primadonna!  And it was a clean fight, too!
25200/0:(gray surprised noise)
25200/1:What?
25201/0:(gray shruggy noise)
25201/1:Mistake...
25202/0:Chairman Dumier lusts for worldly power.  JC Denton, what's left of him, lusts for worldly bliss.  And to both of them you are nothing but a finely wrought tool.
25203/0:She will do no more harm.  
25204/0:Someone... not of our kind... passed among us.
25204/1:Trespasses.
25205/0:Don't be fooled by the wind -- the dust always comes back.
25206/0:Stolen.
25206/1:A thief?
25207/0:Well, hello...
25208/0:Hurtful one.
25208/1:Violence.
25209/0:After the attack on Chicago, aren't you a little nervous?  Why so many transfers?
25210/0:Murderer!
25210/1:Forcing endings.
25211/0:
25211/1:
25211/2:
25211/3:
25211/4:
25211/5:
25212/0:Did she give you any trouble, Chris?
25213/0:Sorry... I got into an argument with my travel agent.  Just tell me.
25214/0:What needs to be done?
25215/0:Lived here my whole life.  I know this town better than anyone.
25216/0:Sorry, there's no layaway plan.
25217/0:I wonder if these attacks mean another Collapse is going to happen.
25218/0:Give me a good clean fistfight any day.  Strategy.  Training.  Skill.  Now THAT'S somethin' to bet on.
25219/0:Probably sleepers.  Your Mag Rail contract is secure.
25220/0:I'm handling the SMG shipment for David Kurczec.
25221/0:
25222/0:I'm talking about the Collapse.  The biggest depression in world history.  I guess you don't follow current events.
25223/0:Did we see someone?
25223/1:We may have seen someone...
25224/0:Strange sighting...
25224/1:We have seen something...
25225/0:And the air keeps getting worse.  If the Templars don't get us, Plague 11 will.
25226/0:Did we just hear something?
25226/1:Strange noiseness...
25227/0:Where next?
25228/0:Like I always say, bet on the trainer.  Something dirty went down tonight -- that's why Gob-zilla didn't show, but the best trainer always comes out on top.
25229/0:What about my money?
25230/0:Did we feel that?
25230/1:We felt something...
25231/0:
25231/1:
25231/2:
25231/3:
25231/4:
25232/0:(groan) From where is this?
25232/1:(groan) What attacks?
25233/0:He's not my partner anymore.  We ran arms for a while, but then the Omar made a better offer.
25234/0:Oh no!
25234/1:Too much!
25234/2:Help us!
25235/0:Not dead.
25235/1:Sleeping?
25236/0:A loss...
25236/1:Decimation...
25236/2:More destruction...
25237/0:Nooo... please be well.
25237/1:More pain...
25237/2:We cannot lose still more.
25238/0:And so we are now less...
25238/1:Another lost...
25238/2:(weeping) // ??
25239/0:My poor Eeva!  Something's happened -- I know it!
25240/0:This is a bad time to be harassing strangers.  We just had a terrorist attack, you know.
25241/0:Better get down there and place your bet.
25242/0:Not one Omar will escape.  This will be the end of their presence in Cairo.
25243/0:Five years ago, there was a significant shift in Swell 9, but that was caused by el nino.  Most predictors seemed to indicate that all of the nanological clouds were permanent aftereffects from environmental damage done in the wake of The Collapse.  
25244/0:Close the place down and go home.  Whoever came after my niece and murdered our technicians is still looking for her.  I came back to my apartment for my Parental Pass so that I could check up on my daughter at the Tarsus school, but the headmaster assures me that she's safe.  Still debating whether to go anyway.  Don't return to work until you hear from me personally.
25245/0:It's illegal to move biohazards with the Inclinator's cargo hold.  Must've thought they could bend the rules.
25246/0:Never seen 'Zilla fight?  You're in for a treat.
25247/0:Nah, I guess I'll just have to wait for her here, since this is the last place we were all together.  If you see her though, please tell her to meet us here.
25248/0:Come to think of it, you don't look like an enclave type at all.
25249/0:Oh... distress...
25249/1:Seek peace...
25250/0:Someone has been here... with a badness in mind.
25250/1:It's been hurt.
25251/0:No exchange possible.
25252/0:Someone has been here... with a badness in mind.
25252/1:(sigh) We do not like this damaging.
25253/0:Darkness is gone?
25253/1:How did this become on?
25254/0:Light is gone?
25254/1:How did this become off?
25255/0:That should not be open.
25255/1:That should be closed.
25256/0:That should not be closed.
25256/1:That should be open.
25257/0:
25257/1:
25257/2:
25258/0:What is causing this motion?
25258/1:How is this moving?
25259/0:Need a hand?
25259/1:I've got your back now.
25259/2:We can split the combat pay, eh?
25259/3:Why's everyone always messin' with us?
25259/4:Double your fun?
25259/5:Uh-oh, better help out.
25260/0:I sense absence.
25260/1:There was something here.
25261/0:Oh no, you can't have that bonus all to yourself.
25261/1:Need some help?
25261/2:No paycheck is worth this, eh?
25261/3:I've got your back now.
25261/4:Now you'll have to deal with both of us.
25262/0:I think something illegal is happening.  People hide their faces as they walk by me.  They avoid my questions.
25263/0:I sense disorder in this item.
25263/1:This is away from its home.
25264/0:A new civilization -- that's a pretty tall order.  What do you need from me?
25265/0:A plague, yes... but not in the way they imagine.
25266/0:Why do you want to know?
25267/0:
25268/0:You're an impressionable young man.  Do you have any idea what you just liberated from the ice?  No matter.  The brother, Paul, is in my custody, and such he will stay.
25269/0:She went in there and threw the switch.  There was an electrical fire.  The guy I was talking to went in to rescue her, but when he got there she was gone.
25270/0:Hold on.  I'll be right back.
25271/0:In good time, friend.
25272/0:Hi there, foxy.
25273/0:There has been conflict here.
25273/1:Signs of battle.  
25274/0:Simpson said Apostlecorp takes unsuspecting CHILDREN, runs tests on them and starts breaking their bodies down in elementary school, like they're just animals.  I've heard they've even killed people for spare body parts.
25275/0:You don't seem too overwhelmed.
25276/0:It is false.
25276/1:A deception only.
25277/0:
25278/0:More battles...
25278/1:When can we rest...?
25279/0:So weary of this...
25279/1:Again...
25280/0:(gray grunt)
25280/1:(gray grunt)
25281/0:Hit.
25281/1:Damage done.
25282/0:Hey, Jack.  Listen up.  Wanna scrip' some REAL cash?  You look like the mercenary type.
25283/0:Hit.
25283/1:Damage done.
25284/0:Adversary stopped.
25284/1:Adversary down.
25285/0:How are our friends at the Order and WTO going to deal with New Cairo?  Hear anything before you left Trier?  I would think they would dispatch a force to retake the city.
25286/0:We thought you were from JC.
25286/1:We thought we could trust you, like JC.
25286/2:We regret this...
25286/3:We must have sensed wrong.  We mistook you for one of JC's.
25286/4:There is no Denton here.
25287/0:We missed.
25287/1:We cannot hit.
25288/0:
25289/0:Thanks again for your help.  The chopper should be along soon.
25290/0:
25291/0:She's an impressionable little thing.  You'll get your endorsement.
25292/0:We have no more use for you here.
25293/0:Commander Maxwell wants the access restrictions fully enforced, and I'm not risking my job by bending the rules.
25294/0:That's a pretty fanciful accusation.
25295/0:The Order is spiritually rich, but that doesn't buy many private jets.  I think Sid Black might be waiting for you at Sak's landing pad.  He would get the job done.
25296/0:Must be a one-size-fits-all operation.
25297/0:At least we minimized casualities, in spite of being caught off guard.
25298/0:They don't think much at all, as far as I can tell.
25299/0:Shall we conduct business?
25300/0:Mike and I... we've worked here for years...  Usually nothing makes it past the turrets.
25301/0:I wiped out the leadership of all three factions, as you suggested.  Now all we have to do is destroy the machine inside the Statue.
25302/0:You'll see.  Something big's coming down the pike.  The spill is just the first stage.
25303/0:Thank you for believing us.  We tried to tell people, but they just thought it was a prank.
25304/0:Good day, sir.
25305/0:Thanks again.  I owe you, Alex.
25306/0:Protection from what?
25307/0:I'm as ignorant as you. I did see the paladins remove a cryogenically frozen body -- maybe that was the facility director, maybe a botched experiment.  Who knows? 
25308/0:I make it a point to scope out the rookies.  They're too young to have fight-records, so a lot of times the odds are all out of whack.
25309/0:I sense a great fear.
25309/1:Adversary flees us...
25310/0:Adversary has missed us.
25310/1:Fail to hit us.
25311/0:Adversary hiding from us.
25311/1:Sense adversary... not sure where...
25311/2:Adversary lost... 
25312/0:Why struggle with breathers when simply drinking this tonic can counter all of the nanites' effects?
25313/0:(grunt) Pain.
25313/1:Ugh!
25314/0:Unhurt.
25314/1:Nothing.
25315/0:The scabs in this town?  They'd join any group that put a few credit chits in their pockets.
25316/0:(grunt) No no no sleep...
25316/1:(groan) Aiieee!  Poison!
25317/0:Flames!
25317/1:Fire!
25317/2:(scream)
25317/3:(scream)
25318/0:I don't know who paid you to kill Her Holiness, but you better hope they know how to get you out of Trier alive.
25319/0:Your fate cannot be denied.  The Invisible Hand guides even you.
25320/0:No problem, except I'm broke.  Just let me run to the ATM first.
25321/0:(moan) Ooooh... eyes...
25321/1:(moan) It burns...
25322/0:Sorry, I don't have enough money. [400]
25323/0:Scrambler grenades -- give me those. [600]
25324/0:Chairman Dumier of the WTO here.  So you found that old fool, Tracer Tong?  I would like to know what you were talking about.  Please report to the Trier SSC station.  It's at the end of the block, on your left as you enter the main square.
25325/0:Give me the energy cells. [300]
25326/0:
25327/0:This is what I think the WTO should do.  Hang KEEP OUT signs at every checkpoint and replace those SSC flunkies with WTO military.
25328/0:The Order is with you.  Go.  You're free.
25329/0:You have proven to be a great ally, Alex.  JC looks forward to opening a new era in human history with you by his side.
25330/0:Your compensation will be access to our markets.
25331/0:We will remain.
25331/1:We will be.
25332/0:We are in great danger.
25332/1:More losses... more losses...
25333/0:I hope they can get the looting under control before they have to cancel the summit.
25334/0:(groan)
25334/1:(groan)
25335/0:No... we cannot lose more...
25335/1:Fading out...
25336/0:Umph.
25336/1:Nooo...
25337/0:(gasp)
25338/0:Your kind...  always destroying life.
25338/1:We only wanted to be left alone... You bring this on yourselves...
25338/2:Why does your kind thrive on so much conflict?
25339/0:We thought we could trust you, like JC.
25339/1:We must have sensed wrong -- you cannot be of JC.
25339/2:How could we have thought there was Denton here?
25340/0:(gray burbling)
25340/1:We sense...
25340/2:We detect... another Wanderer...
25340/3:Too much...
25340/4:Where is peace?
25341/0:(grumbly gray noises)
25341/1:(grumbly gray noises)
25341/2:(grumbly gray noises)
25342/0:Wish I had more cash.  I'd bet more.  [250 credits.]
25343/0:Alex, what are you doing?  The grays are no threat to you -- they are allied with JC.  He approached you in peace and you murdered him.
25344/0:I represent your new supplier.  Mr. Kurczec is dead.
25345/0:No matter what happens to me, the aspirations of ApostleCorp will live on.  I've made sure of that.
25346/0:Rent.  I hear ya.  The WTO shouldn't ration construction permits.
25347/0:Right!  Knights!  That's rich.... Beat up a few defenseless bystanders, and suddenly you're --
25348/0:I'm sorry I dragged you into all of this.
25349/0:I'm fine....  I should've listened to you in Germany and left the WTO while I had the chance.
25350/0:What's going on up there?  I know there was a toxic spill, but it doesn't seem like anything's being done about it.
25351/0:Not interested.  Sorry.
25352/0:Making tomorrow look like yesterday...
25352/1:Substrates...not bonding...
25352/2:Experiment 2156B is a success...
25352/3:The russians have nothing on us...
25353/0:Danger... danger... danger... // chattering
25353/1:It is not safe!
25354/0:Mistake. 
25354/1:Apologies.
25355/0:That way.
25356/0:No.
25357/0:Well, hello...
25358/0:(greeting gray noise)
25358/1:Hello.
25359/0:(greeting gray noise)
25359/1:Hello.
25360/0:Stop.
25360/1:We do not like this.
25360/2:(quizzical/aggravated gray noise)
25361/0:Back away.
25361/1:Stay away from us.
25362/0:I'm glad I'm getting in the extra hours with this riot, but I'm ready for things to go back to normal now.
25363/0:You are not welcome here.
25363/1:This place is not for you.
25364/0:Oh...  Yeah...  Somehow my daughter, Sandy, got away from me.  She's probably just looking at another one of the exhibits... a naturally scientific and curious mind -- I think she may make it into Tarsus next year...  Anyway, as I was saying, it's probably nothing but I am a bit worried.  
25365/0:Okay...  I'm Alex.
25366/0:Whatever.  Pequod's beans go through a far more selective process.  It's a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for.
25367/0:History moves in fits and starts.  Obviously you're too young to remember pre-Collapse society.  I watched two centuries of progress vanish during two minutes on the evening news.
25368/0:Sure, Her Holiness comes to town NOW -- but it is just a show.  We need action, not more talk.
25369/0:We would all like to feel a bit safer and more in control. 
25370/0:That haptic interface is MINE.  
25371/0:Good luck, miss.
25372/0:Anyway, I'm hoping to find someone with more guts than these guys to do some quick "contract" work for a decent number of credits.  If you manage to take care of it, report back to me, so I can pay you.  Until then, no one's going to be able to get down to Lower Seattle. [100 credits]
25373/0:I'm the one who has to face the music, especially given the Chicago situation...
25374/0:Some of those stories about the Order have got to be propaganda.
25375/0:MAN it's cold.
25376/0:Hey, back off.
25377/0:No, thanks.
25378/0:
25379/0:What are you looking for?
25379/1:What do you seek?
25380/0:Must be some sort of quantum effects on those particles.  That's my theory.
25381/0:What are you attempting?
25381/1:We find this confusing.
25382/0:You will not try to harm us.
25382/1:You should not attack us.
25383/0:VIP membership is worth almost any cost for someone in your line of work.  Trust me on this.
25384/0:You will make more enemies if you continue.
25384/1:You are hurting us.  Stop.
25385/0:What's the word?  Looks like Tina put the Claw in the chute instead of Gob-zilla.  (laugh)
25386/0:Stop what you are doing!
25386/1:(increasingly aggravated gray noise)
25387/0:Back away!
25387/1:Stand away from us now!
25388/0:Go back!
25388/1:You are not for this place.
25389/0:Stop staring.
25389/1:Stop looking.
25390/0:Your kind confuses us endlessly.
25390/1:Your intentions remain unclear.
25391/0:That's my only reward -- a discount?
25392/0:Do not attack.
25392/1:Do not threaten.
25393/0:We'll always lead the people, though they'll never know our names.
25394/0:I guess it's all about casting the widest net.
25395/0:We cannot allow them to prevail.
25396/0:There was a time when we were the rebels.  The older generation had failed us in so many ways.  But now we see that the flaw was in their methods, not their intentions.
25397/0:Sandy!
25398/0:You should move along.  I don't want anyone to see us talking.
25399/0:Go outside to the abandoned VersaLife base.  You will need to turn on the pilot beacon so that I can land safely.
25400/0:There's a harrier pilot who owes me a favor.  I'll see if he's interested.
25401/0:You're quite near an imprisoned gray.  Save the poor creature, or the Templars will vivisect him to learn about the grays' vulnerabilities.
25402/0:Harmless missionaries at the train station?  Or sleeper agents for a regime fundamentally opposed to commercial society?
25403/0:Used to have this little single-prop airplane.  Flew an ammo run for Sophia Sak.  Not bad for a scab like me.
25404/0:You've already turned on the generator, so now you must upload the Sequencing Module from the Gate Control Room.
25405/0:I could tell you, but what a waste that would be of your data processing ability.
25406/0:We will rule from the shadows, and bring them into the light.
25407/0:
25408/0:If you continue with your danger, we will retaliate.
25408/1:Do not persiste directing your violence this way.
25409/0:
25409/1:
25410/0:Do not force us to respond.
25410/1:We will do what we must.
25411/0:If you don't have a school pass, you shouldn't be in there.  All parents and guardians get one.
25412/0:STOP!
25412/1:GET AWAY!
25413/0:That guy over there at the table wants to steal one of your paintings.
25414/0:Visual event.
25415/0:Possible threat.  Visual confirmation.
25416/0:Person.  Visual confirmation.
25417/0:Auditory event.
25418/0:Tactile information.
25419/0:(grunt) Enemy present...
25419/1:(grunt) Unexpected assault.
25420/0:This is Headmaster Archer's office.
25421/0:Then get lost.
25422/0:Unknown activity.  Analyzing...
25423/0:One of the kids probably let it out for kicks.
25424/0:Look at this funhouse.  I guess it's some sort of architectural photo album.  This room is from Hong Kong -- where JC Denton went into hiding for a while.  Talk about ego.  Is this what you want to bring about -- the whole world recreated in his image?
25425/0:My last gig was in Detroit.  They have one of those things on every corner.
25426/0:Well, I hope I didn't steal your thunder.  When you get to the dock, you'll probably come across his dead body.
25427/0:Are there more of you caged here?
25428/0:Here you go.  The credit will be invalidated if we find out that you're lying.
25429/0:Much activity now... much disruption.
25430/0:The hazardous materials have since been contained and eliminated.  The Inclinator is now running on schedule.
25431/0:A new face.  Interesting.  Introduce yourself.
25432/0:I would not sell to the Omar, but they have taken control of the distribution channels.
25433/0:Just some things I scavenged from a couple of thugs a while back.  You with the raiding party or something?  I guess you've been pretty good about avoiding my people so far.  I'm selling some if this stuff, if you're interested.
25434/0:The Order is not so aggressive in other cities.  This Saman just went extreme on them.
25435/0:Finally, a real fight.
25436/0:We'll split the combat pay.
25436/1:They don't pay us enough for this, do they?
25436/2:I guess I can't hang you out to dry.
25436/3:It may just be a job, but we stick together.
25436/4:Hang on -- I'll give you a hand.
25436/5:Just a sec -- I'll take your back.
25437/0:We'll split the combat pay.
25437/1:They don't pay us enough for this, do they?
25437/2:I guess I can't hang you out to dry.
25437/3:It may just be a job, but we stick together.
25437/4:Hang on -- I'll give you a hand.
25437/5:Just a sec -- I'll take your back.
25438/0:
25439/0:
25440/0:Would you like to buy a can?  Special price -- today only.
25441/0:Why are you hiding out back here?  
25442/0:And that's why you killed Her Holiness, the spiritual leader of half the world?
25443/0:Looks like we have a fight on our hands.
25444/0:Wrong answer.
25445/0:Sorry?  Who are you to be sorry?  You kill the parents and now you come to kill the uncle?  Well, the Nassif family is fighting back.  Leila escaped and you won't find her.
25446/0:Great -- that means we're the buffer.
25447/0:Now c'mon -- you know Jennifer earned those scores honestly.  That Nassif, though, she's a weirdo.
25448/0:If you'll excuse me now, I have work to do.
25449/0:Toward your passenger?
25450/0:I don't even have to worry about this weird weather when I'm wearing this thing.
25451/0:Well, for one thing, she just dumped me.  She flipped because I forgot her folks were dead.  Like I'm supposed to remember every detail about her life when I haven't seen her in two months.  At least she lives near a good bar.
25452/0:Your instructions were to remain in hiding until one of us contacted you.
25453/0:Thank you, sir.  Move along now.
25454/0:I talked to the facility director and got the details on the mess.  I want to take a look at the extent of the damage.  I might take the clean-up contract.
25455/0:That landing pad is run by a local smuggler, Sophia Sak.  Looks like they seized Sid Black's harrier -- probably as payment for phony debts.  It never hurts to have a pilot who owes you a favor.  You could pay the debt or -- better -- eliminate Sak and her henchmen for the good of the whole neighborhood.
25456/0:I can't afford the gas grenades now.  Maybe later. [600]
25457/0:I could go through the teleporter, too, right?  I wonder why Mr. Dumier ordered me to stay here and secure the church.
25458/0:My mom's been kinda down since we got kicked out of our house.  Maybe we can get an apartment now.
25459/0:I can't wait until the next album.
25460/0:But people dedicate their lives to these causes, and it turns out they're just your pawns?
25461/0:What makes you think this job isn't on the up and up?
25462/0:Hi.  I'm NG Resonance.  What would you like to talk about, Alex?
25463/0:I've got work to do.
25464/0:JC does not use the word "Advance."  This notion is present in my original programming, as constructed by Tracer Tong in the 2040s.
25465/0:
25466/0:You don't want to get mixed up with a bunch of cyborgs, anyway.
25467/0:If the parent company is WTO-chartered, it probably isn't illegal.
25468/0:Is that a unique detail?
25469/0:Although you did not help our kind, you answered the higher calling, to JC.  You are not our enemy.
25470/0:JC remains in a deep coma.  You need to transfer your biomod architecture to the five JC-Helios processing modules.  Then JC Denton will want to speak with you.  I will remain offshore.  When you're ready, I will take you to your next destination.
25471/0:Yes -- this is the Cairo branch of your old alma-mater, curiously geared toward younger children rather than covert security.  There should be some clues about ApostleCorp inside.  You should make a thorough search of the premises.
25472/0:
25473/0:Everything leading up to this, all the work and sacrifice, has been well worth it.
25474/0:
25474/1:
25474/2:
25475/0:Sid Black.  How'd you end up in Cairo?
25476/0:That's a lotta hours you're lookin' at down there, a lotta hours tryin' to beat some sense into that prehistoric brain.
25477/0:Interesting theory.  What is it you want from me?
25478/0:Slow down, kiddo!  Lots of juice running through these transformers.
25479/0:I think they're right.  The WTO's lockin' up all the jobs, all the technology -- and they're turnin' it back on themselves.  They're makin' a super-race with genetics, implants, biomods, whatever it takes.
25480/0:I think I changed my mind about that other key.
25481/0:Some of us are smart enough to see through you.
25482/0:I remember when this town was full of seagulls.  Now it's a wasteland.  Rubble, vacant buildings, mutants everywhere.  They eat each other, they eat people's pets, they eat bums that fall asleep by the wrong sewer drain -- and I brought children into this world.
25483/0:There's a harrier pilot who owes me a favor.  I'll see if he's interested.
25484/0:Nanologists and meteorologists continue to watch Nanite Swell 11 intently.  All indicators so far suggest that this is not a spurious short-term change but a radical climatological shift that scientists expect will severely weaken the effects of this swell, if not eliminate it entirely.  
25485/0:What!?
25486/0:Stop the hate.  Report all Templar activity -- before it's too late for YOUR community.
25487/0:
25488/0:You better not mess with me!
25489/0:I wonder if they even cared how we did at the training.  Or was it purely a medical test?
25490/0:You've sure got a prime location for your business here.
25491/0:
25492/0:
25493/0:Just hang in there, Bug.
25494/0:
25495/0:
25496/0:
25497/0:Only the select qualify for admission into Cairo's Tarsus Academy.  Is your son or daughter our next star?
25498/0:I don't know what to say....  Thanks, Alex.  I'll pay you back -- double.
25499/0:Well, I've turned your heart just in time.  Now make sure that JC Denton has been killed, then step into his machine inside the Statue so that the ducts will be primed with your nanite-capsid architecture.  My scientists will do the rest.
25500/0:We maintain the habitat for him while he struggles to assimilate the Helios entity, the artificial intelligence with which he joined.  The merger gave him great power, but also threatened him with madness.  He sleeps now to heal.
25501/0:We've got our hands full -- most of our guards are at headquarters providing security for the summit.
25502/0:Awaiting payment...
25503/0:
25504/0:
25505/0:
25505/1:
25505/2:
25505/3:
25505/4:
25505/5:
25505/6:
25505/7:
25506/0:
25507/0:Rent.  I hear ya.  The WTO shouldn't ration construction permits.
25508/0:You wouldn't fall for something like that.
25509/0:
25510/0:I'll let you know.
25511/0:Someone in the village, but the Templar command is in the arcology.  They have a recruiting kiosk there.  We can't move people into New Cairo too easily.
25512/0:
25513/0:
25514/0:
25515/0:
25516/0:
25517/0:
25518/0:
25519/0:How do you control human emotions?  Antidepressants?  Is that freedom?
25520/0:
25521/0:
25522/0:
25523/0:You've proven once and for all that a sound economic infrastructure establishes confidence, trust, and a good life for everyone.  Why demean yourself by negotiating with a religious cult?
25524/0:
25525/0:Tell his bodyguard that you're handling the SMG shipment for an arms smuggler named David Kurczec.  That will get you inside the apartment.  Do this, and I will pay you a handsome reward [300 credits], plus a VIP membership.  Repeat anything I just said, however, and you will join Mr. O'Rourke in a long trip to Lower Seattle from the Space-Needle overlook.  Thank you for choosing Club Vox.
25526/0:I don't have time for your nonsense now!
25527/0:Well, for one thing, she just dumped me.  She flipped because I forgot her folks were dead.  Like I'm supposed to remember every detail about her life when I haven't seen her in two months.  At least she lives near a good bar.
25528/0:You made it in.  Now start searching her apartment.  Maybe there's a datacube or something...
25529/0:But --
25530/0:I hope they re-open the school.  Mom says it is my insurance against being poor.
25531/0:Every time I come here I get two prescriptions -- one for breather filters, one for meditation.
25532/0:Don't sweat it.  They called the raid off.
25533/0:Our message was much simpler in the beginning.
25534/0:Yeah?
25535/0:Guess I haven't scored any points with Dr. Nassif.
25536/0:The scabs outside Upper Seattle have their high-minded reasons for opposing the WTO, but it all comes down to envy.
25537/0:I think the world would be better off if people took the best things from both sides instead of always fighting over extremes.
25538/0:I have to stay focused, but these strange events keep nagging at me.
25539/0:It's not just the big boys who need to hire mercenaries, you know.
25540/0:I don't think she's your type.
25541/0:It will be a pleasure to neutralize the enemy with you.
25542/0:In the long run, I guess this chaos means job security for the SSC.  That's what I keep telling myself, at least.
25543/0:But I TALKED to Mr. Paladin, one-on-one.  He laid it all out, straight up.
25544/0:My daughter's upset over the situation in Chicago.
25545/0:I've been following the ApostleCorp investigation very closely.  Your loyalty in this matter would be a great asset.  However, we have a more pressing crisis.  Her Holiness is missing, along with my security chief, Donna Morgan.  By chance was this on the agenda for your meeting with that old curmudgeon at the Nine Worlds?
25546/0:I don't think they'll waste time on a trial -- not where assassination is concerned.
25547/0:This is not the solution I was looking for.  
25548/0:Tell me about the young woman.
25549/0:I hope they can get the looting under control before they have to cancel the summit.
25550/0:Convergence... convergence... peace.
25551/0:Sir, that's close enough.  Do not approach the checkpoint.
25552/0:
25553/0:She was a great leader and a great friend.  You completely misunderstand our work.  The Collapse would have been far more devastating if Nicolette and I hadn't accepted her family's legacy and rebuilt the Illuminati organization, which was nearly destroyed by MJ-12.
25554/0:What next?
25555/0:If you're meeting someone, you still need to check in at reception.
25556/0:What about the money I gave NG's manager?
25557/0:A lot of Lower-Seattle types are signing up with the Knights Templar, because the Templars want to exterminate these mutated pests.
25558/0:I heard that some of the striking workers broke into a meeting and kidnapped Her Holiness -- can you believe it?
25559/0:For all you know, I'm a Templar myself.
25560/0:I'm running.
25561/0:I've got a lot of grading to do.
25562/0:You know an awful lot about police business.
25563/0:Shutterbug's a cage-fed housecat, in my opinion.  House should be giving her odds.  But it's your money.  
25564/0:You can't get any info out of them.  They're just animals after all that modification.
25565/0:Thanks for the information.  We need more responsible citizens like you.
25566/0:
25566/1:
25566/2:
25566/3:
25567/0:I answer only to the Grand Master now, and I think I see in your eyes... yes... tell-tale signs of biomodification.
25568/0:This is Leila Nassif.  Sorry, I'm out of the country right now.  I'll be in touch next time I'm in town.  Bye.
25569/0:Back to business as usual.
25570/0:Right.  Well, I'll take out whoever you want for 2000 credits.
25571/0:They say I have chosen.  They say they will find me when I'm asleep and complete the operation.  Then I will think like an Omar.  It will be too late for choices.
25572/0:I heard they took the leader out of the city.
25573/0:I've got one right here.
25574/0:I guess I made a mistake.  I thought Tarsus put out a different sort of product.  Here's your money, bandita.
25575/0:You must find another Omar, in another city perhaps, to do business.
25576/0:Let's do this thing.  People are watching.
25577/0:I hear ya.  Have something specific in mind?
25578/0:You're talking about those freaks who get biomodded or turned into cyborgs, right?  Wish there was something we could do about them.
25579/0:Sir.
25580/0:
25581/0:Who are you?  And how do you know who I am?
25582/0:Things are pretty hectic in the HQ offices now.
25583/0:I'm always on, 24-7.  Whenever you need me.
25584/0:
25585/0:My poor Eeva!  Something's happened -- I know it!
25586/0:Her Holiness has lost sight of the true path -- 
25587/0:No thanks.
25588/0:Tough luck all around.  A draw.  Here's your money back.
25589/0:No problem.
25590/0:So you're a part of Versalife?  I thought that corporation folded during the Collapse.  Quite a few people believe they actually caused it, in fact.
25591/0:Just taking a break.
25592/0:That was UNATCO headquarters, right?  United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition.  I know what I'm talking about.  I heard it was a front for the terrorists who made the Gray Death and brought about the Collapse.
25593/0:I'm running.
25594/0:I was in on a consultation.  That sucker they built shoots through walls!  I'm supposed to keep an eye on the ecological impacts -- and not go too close to the rear of the complex.
25595/0:They're making us do security drills at the academy.
25596/0:
25597/0:So much for making it big in organized crime.
25598/0:Nothing to be concerned about.  You have your assignment, Alex.
25599/0:You will each be interviewed individually in the near future to determine your interests and how they position you within the company.  Please keep in mind how important security has become.  We are looking for assurances that moving you into these new positions is the right thing at this time.
25600/0:More meat for the chop shop....
25601/0:What do I look like?  A taxi driver?
25602/0:Enough talk.  It only makes me angry.
25603/0:When I said twenty-four hours, I meant twenty-four hours minus my sleep time.  I'm about ready to hit the sack.
25604/0:Hi there...
25605/0:I heard he got arrested because he was plotting against the students.
25606/0:Thanks for the warm welcome.
25607/0:An admirable gesture regarding my brother.  Unfortunately, you wrecked his life's work by handing the Aquinas hub to our enemy.  I just had one of my grays communicate this fact to him telepathically.
25608/0:Here you go.
25609/0:Tarsus Tracking Report 4117 -- Alex D.  There are concerns that D. may be the greatest threat among her peers. Last seen in Cairo, eliminating Leila Nassif for the Order.   Intel suggests that she now has objectives in Trier.  This makes it imperative that we get our agent through the gate immediately and shut it down.
25610/0:
25611/0:
25612/0:This is a Special Report from World News.  Coming on the heels of the Chicago disaster, the city of Seattle has been hit by a series of terrorist attacks.
25613/0:We're not exactly sure what went wrong, but there are some radical cells within the Order that want to take more extreme measures.  They certainly don't represent the Order as a whole.  
25614/0:Just sayin' goodbye to my girl.  Always chokes me up a little.
25615/0:Doesn't look that way to me.
25616/0:Shutdown.
25616/1:Critical damage.
25617/0:Nice try.  Sorry.
25618/0:Now, I know you're both ready for assignments, but Tarsus is seeing everything through the events at Chicago right now.  Security is higher than ever. Soon you'll each be interviewed individually to determine your interests and suitability for assignments. We know you're anxious. Hang in there.
25619/0:Combat support required.
25620/0:Mission accepted.
25620/1:Executing.
25621/0:All I need you to do is finish off JC Denton.  The world doesn't need a new god.
25622/0:I appreciate the concern, but I can think for myself.
25623/0:Scanning.
25623/1:Processing.
25623/2:Surveyed region clear.
25624/0:The Omar appreciate your business.
25625/0:(bleeps)
25625/1:(hums)
25625/2:(signal noise)
25626/0:Analyzing... unnacceptable.  Please desist.
25627/0:Unauthorized contact.
25628/0:Please peacefully pursue your business.
25628/1:Loitering infraction recorded.
25629/0:Behavior heuristic unnacceptable.
25629/1:First warning: go about your business.
25630/0:We still don't know what happened in Chicago, but we just got confirmation that subjects Billie and Alex were successfully evacuated to Seattle.  We'll try to maintain secrecy there, but it looks like our cover may be blown.
25631/0:Femi!  Come down -- it's a beautiful day for a walk.
25632/0:Clearance denied.  Return to your place of origin.
25632/1:Authorized personnel only.
25633/0:Really?  I haven't heard any shooting.  Are you sure it wasn't an accident?
25634/0:Get me out of here!
25635/0:But how?
25636/0:Hey, yo, outta here.  Now.
25637/0:I'm sure you have everything under control.
25638/0:Sit tight!?  I need to take off before it's too late!
25639/0:What am I supposed to do?
25640/0:We cannot hear you clearly and what you plan.
25641/0:Let go of the Church.  You are a Templar paladin now.
25642/0:Put your weapon away.
25642/1:Interference with security platforms: not advisable.
25643/0:Possible threat: reclassifying individual.
25644/0:Thanks.  Just what I wanted to hear.
25645/0:There is no more merchandise.
25646/0:Second warning.  Please refrain from that behavior.
25646/1:Violation noted.
25647/0:I don't know how long the medina can survive.
25648/0:Wait -- I've got to snap out of it.
25649/0:Security platforms are authorized to protect their systems with force.
25649/1:No further contact, please.
25650/0:Keep moving.  Tampering with security devices is a crime.
25651/0:A man with black hair?  Glasses?
25652/0:Stop that activity.
25652/1:Behavior heuristic classified as hostile.
25653/0:

25653/5:
25653/6:
25653/7:
25654/0:Leave the area.  Requesting immediate compliance.
25654/1:You are ordered to leave immediately.
25655/0:I've taken care of the problem.  The area is no longer hazardous.
25656/0:Warning: threat classification has been modified upward.
25656/1:Weapons must remain concealed.  Please observe this policy.
25657/0:Assault classified as deliberate.
25657/1:Motivation of assailant unclear.  Use of force postponed, pending additional data.
25658/0:Third warning.  Modify your behavior immediately.
25658/1:Violators are expected to heed all security-platform warnings.
25659/0:Who are you -- some PR man coming to talk me out of it?  I will not give in.  Pequod's runs ads on the public terminal right across the street from my shop, and they don't even have a branch in Trier!
25660/0:Which means me.
25661/0:
25662/0:What's the sample for?
25663/0:
25663/1:
25664/0:Primary objectives have been advanced -- at last, welcome progress.
25665/0:Due to the pollution I've never really explored the medina.  Maybe I'll try to find that coffee stand everyone talks about.
25666/0:Most predictors seem to indicate that all of the nanological clouds are permanent aftereffects from environmental damage done in the wake of The Collapse.  
25667/0:Would you like to make a purchase?
25668/0:You'll see.  Something big's coming down the pike.  The spill is just the first stage.
25669/0:Hm, and it looks like you've got your hands full already.  Maybe you could ask one of the guards for help?
25670/0:Thanks.  Now I've got a toxic spill AND a major liability running right through it.
25671/0:I bet it's a coordinated attack.  They got the Inclinator and some sort of job training program.
25672/0:Final warning.  Battle systems ready.
25673/0:Seeking additional combat units.
25674/0:Engaging the enemy.
25675/0:Taking backward position.
25675/1:Avoiding threat.
25676/0:Affirmative.  Enemy nearby.
25677/0:Negative.
25677/1:No anomalies to report.
25678/0:Authorized.  Proceed.
25679/0:Proceed.
25680/0:Smoke-screen deployed.
25680/1:Reducing visual signature.
25681/0:Systems need repair.
25682/0:Repeat: the haze appears to contain only mildly parasitic nanoscale fallout.  Cover your mouth and nose when traveling outdoors, but rest assured: the danger is minimal.  
25683/0:Market disruption. The genius of the ApostleCorp product is that it restructures any host's DNA to tolerate biomodification, whereas the standard infusions work for only one in twenty patients.  ApostleCorp could go commercial and devastate biomod prices.
25684/0:You have a generous heart.  You would make a good Seeker, but Order has many enemies, and often appeasement only prolongs a problem.  Now go to the Greasel Pit bar and find Sid Black.  I bet he will be happy to take you to Mako.
25685/0:I don't know where he is, but he better show up soon.  The facility here is being raided by the Templars.  So far we're holding our own, but I don't know how much longer that will last.  This may be my last transmission...
25686/0:They cannot get the factory under control.  The workers have seized the facility.
25687/0:I'd like to know what it does.  That woman, Adams.  I think she knows.  She got all queer when I asked about it.
25688/0:If I stand by Her Holiness, perhaps we can put an end to these rumors.
25689/0:You have done what is necessary.  We wish there was another way.
25690/0:I told you to check in with Billie first.  Apartment 454.  She will give you the elevator code.
25691/0:I'm running.
25692/0:Subsumption (garble garble) error (garble) systems (squeal) error (bleep) error.
25693/0:Systems powering down.
25694/0:Autonomous processing interrupted.
25695/0:Autonomous processing restored.  Scanning for source of disruption.
25696/0:I tried to sign up, but they said they didn't need me.
25697/0:Checking sensors...
25697/1:Signal disruption.
25698/0:Alex D.  The information you provided our agent was incorrect.  The Omar trader in the medina has been assassinated.  Your future business with the Omar will remain on unfavorable terms.
25699/0:You never WERE very loyal.  Why start now?
25700/0:Result uncertain.
25700/1:Threat probability: low.
25701/0:Reviewing audio data.
25702/0:
25703/0:She been in many fights?
25704/0:Resuming analysis of anomalies.
25704/1:Additional data.  Assessing...
25705/0:Investigating specific threat.
25705/1:Pattern-match highly probable.
25706/0:Nice.  With one Denton out of the picture, our work will be much easier.  My commandos have already secured a beachhead on the south shore of Liberty Island.  We're ready to back you up.  Contact your pilot with the Flight Bay 23 beacon.  So glad to have you with us, Alex.
25707/0:High Augur Chen is a fine Seeker.  She has a strong heart, but a strong heart often runs contrary to a Seeker's purpose.
25708/0:
25709/0:You want it quick, you get in it.  Come on, y'all, you wanted a bonus?  There's your bonus right there.
25710/0:Given that it's been two years since they tried to infuse him, I'm guessing the procedure did not go according to plan.
25711/0:I cannot wait until everything gets back to normal.
25712/0:The commander can answer your questions.
25713/0:No loitering.
25714/0:Or maybe the Omar have an interest in the program that created us, too.  What do they have you doing out here?
25715/0:Did you forget?  I told Commander Maxwell to give you a key to the gate in the courtyard.  Oh well -- if you'd rather fight your way through a greasel nest, I guess I can't stop you.
25716/0:Encounter probable.
25716/1:Threat probability: medium.
25717/0:Sonic anomaly identified.
25718/0:Vmail sender replied:
25719/0:Warning: restricted area.
25720/0:Oh... I was hired to clean the system out.  The spiderbots haven't really been getting the job done.
25721/0:Threat detected.
25721/1:High alert.
25722/0:No thanks.
25723/0:Unauthorized organic.
25724/0:Threat probability: high.
25725/0:Unknown threat!
25725/1:Surveillance failure.  Taking emergency measures.
25726/0:Unseen enemy.
25727/0:So I get fired, because I won't go along with his plot against Queequeg's.
25728/0:Analyzing collision...
25729/0:Neutralization of the ApostleCorp and Templar threats is at hand.
25730/0:Hi.  I'm NG Resonance.  Welcome, Alex D.  Your last interaction was at Club Vox in New Seattle.  Hey, I heard you were in New Cairo -- and you didn't even stop by my kiosk to say hi.
25731/0:Quit screwing around.
25732/0:The Order are nothing but thieves and terrorists.
25733/0:I knew it!  That man's made a fool out of me for the last time.  By tomorrow he'll be eating rats out of a QueeQueg's dumpster -- mark my word!  Here's your reward.
25734/0:Well, if we're lucky you'll be giving the portal a test-drive before too long.  Good to have you with us.  I had my staff procure this extra biomod canister so that you might be a more effective operative.
25735/0:(inhales)  Ahhh, fresh air...
25736/0:Talk to the Chicago Project Director.  He's on the other side of the biolab.  I'm pretty sure he ran the trials, but he doesn't tell us much.
25737/0:Why so hostile?  I'm not evil.  I merely oppose the powers that have shaped and confined you up until now.  Just allow my scientist, Dr. Todd, to scan your cell nuclei -- and leave Paul alone.
25738/0:Pretty soon everything will be man-made, the trees, the rice and corn, livestock, maybe even people.
25739/0:It seems that the Illuminati is making one last grab for power.  You must revive Paul, Alex.  ApostleCorp needs a strong leader who can restore it to global prominence.  The Illuminati want only to steal our research to increase their wealth and power.
25740/0:Hi.  Name's Alex.
25741/0:
25742/0:I guess we're going to pull through.
25743/0:Phenomenon unfamiliar.  More analysis required.
25744/0:His Time will come again...
25745/0:One of those hippo-things had me cornered.  I panicked and locked myself up.  Hey, think you could get me out of here?  This lock shouldn't be too hard to pick.
25746/0:Enemy tactic identified.
25747/0:
25747/1:

25747/4:
25747/5:
25747/6:
25747/7:
25748/0:Sounds ignored.  Possible deception.
25749/0:The work on hydraulic locomotive amplification has been stimulating -- don't get me wrong -- but I don't know how much longer I can bear to see my work auctioned to the highest bidder.
25750/0:Animal behavior unusual.
25751/0:Thanks -- I think I'll hide out upstairs.
25752/0:Logging animal corpse.
25753/0:Analyzing weapon markings.
25754/0:Investigating device malfunction.
25755/0:Excellent.  The bay doors are opening.  I will be landing soon.
25756/0:Investigating disabled device.
25757/0:Chairman Dumier of the WTO here.  So you found that old fool, Tracer Tong?  I would like to know what you were talking about.  Please report to the Trier SSC station.  It's at the end of the block, on your left as you enter the main square.
25758/0:Investigating moving object.
25759/0:Gonna jump me or what?
25760/0:Finally, we don't have to cower before monolithic governments.  The Collapse has set us free.
25761/0:My business plan didn't have a column for "acts of terror."  Kind of messes with the Pequachino price point.
25762/0:
25762/1:
25762/2:
25762/3:
25762/4:
25762/5:
25763/0:You have my word -- this place is as safe as an army barracks.  And about as exciting, too.
25764/0:Let's take out the remaining Illuminati leader, Nicolette DuClare.
25765/0:This is the main control room.  You should be able to install the Sequencing Module at the computer terminal.
25766/0:After the decimation of Chicago, the obscure motives of Her Holiness and the Order are only part of what worries security experts.  Go under the veil of the Order and you find that perhaps Disorder is a better word for this so-called unified world faith.
25767/0:Another obstacle in your Search, young Seeker -- the inclinator, which is the only way to reach Lower Seattle and our church, has been shut down because of a toxic spill.  The hazard flush system or a nanoformer bot could clean up the mess, but the maintenance team is blocked from using either.  For more details, you might talk to the facility director in her office.
25768/0:Nice day, at least.  Might as well enjoy it for now.
25769/0:Vitakka... vitakka... vitakka....
25770/0:Name's David Kurczec.  These are dangerous times.
25771/0:
25771/1:
25771/2:
25771/3:
25772/0:I got trapped when that toxic stuff spilled.  Even worse, I'm the only one with the code for where we keep the repairbot.  They've got to release it so it can repair the nanoformer which will then clean up the spill.
25773/0:Investigating missing object.
25774/0:Investigating displaced object.
25775/0:Oh -- I was hired to clean the system out. The spider bots haven't really been getting the job done.
25776/0:As you wish.
25777/0:Investigating damaged object.
25778/0:This time -- you will see -- the ends justify the means.
25779/0:Looks like you've divided your loyalties.  I hope eventually you'll pledge yourself to the Order.  In any event, you'll be heading for the Mako facility next, I imagine.
25780/0:Investigating destroyed object.
25781/0:Investigating open door.
25782/0:Investigating closed door.
25783/0:Investigating active light source.
25784/0:Investigating inactive light source.
25785/0:
25785/1:
25786/0:Verified: open.  Investigating activity.
25787/0:Grand Master Saman has ordered us to treat you as an ally.
25788/0:Verified: closed.  Investigating activity.
25789/0:Tell it to the Chief.
25790/0:
25791/0:Hi.  I'm NG Resonance.  What would you like to chat about?
25792/0:Never a dull moment around here.
25793/0:Panzerwerks has tolerated the Order's ecoterrorism for a long time.
25794/0:Nice facility.  You guys are lucky.
25795/0:If you get called in for an interview, you might think about sprucing up your wardrobe.
25796/0:Well, make up your mind.
25797/0:Under control.  The maintenance crew got right on it
25798/0:Go or I call the police!
25799/0:It was bound to happen.  They could only take so much needling from the Order.
25800/0:Get out before I shoot the messenger.
25801/0:We need a new generation of leaders -- and a plan for the generation after that.  Succession within the Illuminati is usually confined to about a dozen families, most of whom were wiped out first by MJ-12 and then by the Collapse.  As for Nicolette and myself, we have been unable to have children.
25802/0:
25803/0:Verified: on.  Investigating activity.
25804/0:Verified: off.  Investigating activity.
25805/0:Dr. Nassif does not want to be found.
25806/0:Now that the old nation-states are gone, the Statue can become a truly universal symbol.
25807/0:Investigating fire.
25808/0:Scanning victim.
25809/0:Cause of death identified.
25810/0:Organic fluid detected.
25811/0:Object classification: carcass.
25812/0:I heard they took the leader out of the city.
25813/0:Are you sure?  I haven't done so well at killing YOU...
25814/0:
25815/0:JC Denton has a hold on your imagination, perhaps.  Talk to your friend Leo in front of the mosque.  See how much he likes enforced modification.  Do you really think ApostleCorp is any different than the sect of the Omar?
25816/0:If you have business here, speak with Miss Sak.  Otherwise, please depart.
25817/0:
25818/0:I thought QueeQueg's stood for something.
25819/0:I have my orders, but I don't trust you.
25820/0:The Order contacted me in Chicago and told me how to uncover Tarsus's treachery -- we're not trainees, we're test subjects.  Finding out I've been used like that, I don't feel so bad about disobeying orders.
25821/0:JC will now speak with you.  I will be waiting offshore so that I can take you to your next destination.
25822/0:Believe me!  Free yourselves from this propaganda!
25823/0:Best job I ever had.
25824/0:Go on, I'm interested in doing business.  I've heard you know where I can find a cure for the plague.
25825/0:Hi.  I'm NG Resonance.  What would you like to talk about, Alex?
25826/0:Exactly.  JC will tell you more.  Please -- don't delay.  Every passing minute brings your friend, Billie, one step closer to murdering the only sincere leader humanity has ever had.
25827/0:Don't worry about me.  You go first, and I'll meet you there.
25828/0:I've deceived millions.  Hundreds of millions of people.  I -- I'm such a fool!
25829/0:Why is that?
25830/0:The exterminator obviously isn't going to show up, so the fee's yours if you get the job done.
25831/0:You could become a very powerful woman, Alex.  With biomodification technology properly regulated, you would be the forerunner of a new elite.
25832/0:
25833/0:That's an interesting viewpoint, especially since JC's work made us both what we are today.
25834/0:More reports of catastrophe in Seattle.  A toxic spill closed the Inclinator bay.  It is not known at this time whether the event was accidental or part of some greater plan.
25835/0:I can tell when a man's had some combat training... HAVE TO in my business.
25836/0:What's the name?  I've been to Trier many times.
25837/0:The idiot didn't follow through, though.  Tina just pumped Gob-zilla's hide full of zyme, and there's my poor Snake-eyes up against Gob-zilla squared.  He won, but man did he take a beating.  What I woulda paid to have the job done right.
25838/0:A lot of those uptown feebs are health nuts, I hear.  Our one-hundred percent organic drink menu is made for them.
25839/0:Dr. Nassif.  She will try to recapture you.
25840/0:At least there's always Queequeg's.
25841/0:Attention - All outbound flights have been delayed.  Please see the flight monitors for more information.
25842/0:Can I just take a peek at that hangar?
25843/0:I have seen the future, and I warn you.  It belongs to the Omar.
25844/0:Proceed to your destination.
25845/0:
25846/0:They won't know what hit 'em.
25847/0:
25848/0:Huh?
25849/0:But -- how?  I've heard that Miss Withers is a leech.  She won't do an endorsement unless there's something in it for herself.
25850/0:We wanted just to be left alone.
25851/0:Of course.  I'll transfer the standard informant's bonus.  Hey -- and you should come see me sing.  I'll put you down for a free ticket -- good for any NG Resonance show foreign or domestic.
25852/0:The freaks are mostly eliminated, and we captured one of their leaders, the illustrious Paul Denton himself.
25853/0:I want to take off this mask and run down the street screaming at my neighbors to do the same!
25854/0:You must know all the ins and outs of this building.
25855/0:You're not a thug.  Be sensible about this.
25856/0:
25856/1:
25857/0:Yes.  A cure has been developed by arcology scientists -- a nanite counter-agent for aerial dispersal.  We believe the research is in a private facility leased by the Templars in the Flight Bay 24 on arcology Level 110.
25858/0:Choice.  The essence of the free market and of freedom itself.  You DEMAND choice, and that's why you welcome the expansion of Pequod's Coffee.  Our drinks are the result of unprecedented innovation in both processing and brewing technologies.  They're healthy, fun, and, well, ALMOST free.  Pequod's -- coming soon to YOUR home town.
25859/0:Purity WILL prevail.
25860/0:The Nassif girl was one of the key candidates for nanite infusion at Tarsus.  Her whole family is likely to give itself over to that pollution, so they must be exterminated.
25861/0:Me?  I'm the utility manager on the first floor.
25862/0:The system will remain offline, until the hazardous materials can be contained.
25863/0:I'm not sure... He and Nicolette DuClare admitted everything to me.  He wants me to go through the ApostleCorp teleporter that connects to JC Denton's sanctuary.  Only the trainees can use it.  Billie already went through -- on a mission for the Templars.
25864/0:I was the Champ.  Three whole months on top of the world.
25865/0:Great, isn't she?
25866/0:My luck's about dried up in this town, if you want to know the truth.
25867/0:Enough talking.  I have much to think about.
25868/0:You know, I could have you SHOT as an Order spy.  The least you could do is be punctual.
25869/0:An end to the battles and silencing is within reach.
25870/0:That looked funny.
25870/1:... thinkin' I saw something.
25871/0:Either I saw somebody or I don't know what.
25872/0:Always another feeb driftin' around, gibbering at nobody, scratchin' in the garbage...
25872/1:Don't like the sound of THAT...
25873/0:Sounded too big to be a rat...
25874/0:Whah!  What's that?
25875/0:(grunt) Chicken!  Show your face!
25875/1:(grunt) Man!
25876/0:(grunt) Hey, you see the scab?  Cuz I can't.
25877/0:Huh.  That's messed up.
25878/0:Apparently Saman trusts you.
25879/0:Hey, man.  Don't look now...
25880/0:Yo, sis'.  Don't look now...
25881/0:The infusions... they still haven't taken...
25882/0:I'll take the frag mod. [1000]
25883/0:Poor girl looks a little shook up.
25884/0:Unlike the first Dentons, who were straight clones of an ideal individual, you were -- how do I put it...? -- average... a feeble little mongrel who was MADE into a Denton.
25885/0:One of these gob things got in my brother's house one night.  Damn near killed his wife.  Now she walks with a cane and can't see five feet in front of her face.
25886/0:
25886/1:
25886/2:
25887/0:Tell that gentleman at the table over there that I would like to invite him to my penthouse to discuss his sculptures over a glass of sherry.
25888/0:... danger... the enemy... very close...
25889/0:You tellin' me that's the World Championship greasel?  Gob fights like a pet bird!
25890/0:You uptown feebs sure like to talk.
25891/0:Why do you persist?  Tong, Dumier, Her Holiness -- they're all fools.  Do you really understand what they're asking you to do?  Go to Tent 04 and I'll contact you there.
25892/0:I'm not fallin' for it...
25893/0:
25894/0:Too much smoke...
25895/0:Scab dropped some smoke...  // warning
25896/0:Hm -- that wasn't what it sounded like.
25897/0:Better not be a gob creepin' around...
25898/0:Wonder what killed it.
25899/0:Great -- some feeb takin' it out on a poor cat.
25900/0:Dead birds fallin' right out of the sky... and they think I'm superstitious.
25901/0:Wonder what killed the rat.
25902/0:You reconsidered.  Good.  Helios is already configuring the new Acquinas hub.  Now come to the Statue.  I need a direct interface with your biomodifications in order to structure Helios properly.  To be the center of a civilization, an electronic mind must mirror the intelligences of the citizens.  We will be the models.
25903/0:That's no excuse for what you did at Tarsus.  The Order's got to be eliminated and I'm starting with you.
25904/0:Guess you have to be modified to see any real action.
25905/0:I'll let you get back to your run.
25906/0:I hope I can sell a design before next month's dues come around.
25907/0:Aerostats protect every one of our stores, so you can be certain that your latte is grit-free.
25908/0:It was good bumping into you, Leo.
25909/0:Stay true, young Pliable.  Now make sure that JC Denton has been killed, then step into his machine inside the Statue so that the ducts will be primed with your nanite-capsid architecture.  My scientists will do the rest.
25910/0:What do you mean by "JC's habitat"?
25911/0:It would be madness to reveal everything.  We must toil in secret to protect them from the harsh realities.
25912/0:And you've found that the Templars are a sane and reasonable employer?
25913/0:The Omar have no time for such nonsense.
25914/0:It's even possible they waited to tell us because they wanted to see how people react to exposure.
25915/0:Hm.  That wasn't open.
25916/0:Hm.  That wasn't closed.
25917/0:So it wasn't an accidental spill?
25918/0:Thought that was off.
25919/0:It sounds like operations are going well.  Show those Omar beasts we will not tolerate their pollution.  And that's just the first step in our plans for this city.  Once the right people are running things, every citizen will wake up -- they'll finally see how important the battle for Purity really is.
25920/0:You're registered to receive a monetary reward.  I can be your cashier if you wish.
25921/0:Thought that was on.
25922/0:Somebody means business...
25923/0:Well, I didn't touch it.  Nobody better blame me...
25924/0:It's gone.  They better not blame ME...
25925/0:I'm sure the WTO isn't thrilled that you went through the spill either.
25926/0:Sure.  NG loves hearing from her fans.
25927/0:You expect ten billion people to submit to the rule of a software construct?  What if some of them resist?
25928/0:Pw!  Piece of junk...
25929/0:Guess it's down for some reason...
25930/0:Where'd THAT come from?
25931/0:Mmmm.  Crikey, I didn't ask.  As soon as women start talking politics, I go blank.  But I wouldn't mind raising some fuel money so I could see her again.  I'll take you wherever you need to go.  [500 credits.]
25932/0:I could tell them myself.  They would think it was the same old story: the Illuminati secretly controlling the world.  Oooo.  Some might believe it, but everybody else would laugh in my face.
25933/0:The Order, huh!  Some kind of religion.  I don't even think they believe in God.
25934/0:
25935/0:Work with our charming co-conspirators just a little while longer.  When you have the Sequencing Module for the gate, you will be free to contact JC on your own.
25936/0:The separation of powers -- from Aristotle to Montesquieu -- is designed purely to thwart the ambitions of individuals.  How comical, the West's pride in its vast tangle of agencies, jurisdictions, arcane procedures...
25937/0:I'll keep an eye out.
25938/0:The facility's under attack -- by who?
25939/0:Do the Omar think they're starting a utopia?
25940/0:You Tarsus brats are all the same.
25941/0:Oh, tra-la-la-lala.... I think I'll fire the bitch.  Right now.
25942/0:Did you manage to hook up with Sandy?
25943/0:Once again, good work in Seattle.  The WTO is making good use of the data.  Your next objective: destroy the Nassif family's greenhouse, which is in the northwest corner of the south medina.  The experimental greenhouse, a violation of WTO regulations, should lead us to Dr. Nassif.
25944/0:Thank goodness he's safe.
25945/0:Your rescue mission was a failure.  Both of the shoppers are dead.  You'll be held responsible for putting those people at risk and failing to get them both to safety.
25946/0:I eavesdropped on the Templar recruiting station in the arcology.
25947/0:Speak with the trader if you wish to transact.
25948/0:In effect, Paul and JC helped make you everything you are today.  It's time to repay that debt.
25949/0:Praise Saman we got to you in time.
25950/0:No need to worry abou those kids.  The headmaster runs a pretty tight ship over there.
25951/0:Just do your best, and I'm sure you'll get a good rating.  We have drills in the morning, exercise and self-study in the afternoons.  Oh!  And you'll be getting a suite of biomods -- they give you the infusions during the first week.
25952/0:That ain't for decoration, I bet.
25953/0:I messed up on crowd-control.  That's why they have me on light-fixture duty.
25954/0:I'm hopin' this will turn into a career in security, if I play my cards right.
25955/0:Someone cut the lights...
25956/0:Pitch black... oooo, scary.  Who's hiding in here?
25957/0:I don't remember it being this dark out here.
25958/0:Why's this light on...?
25959/0:What's the latest gossip?
25960/0:A deception...
25960/1:Tactic recognized.
25961/0:This door shouldn't be open...
25962/0:Smoke being used for cover...
25963/0:This door shouldn't be closed...
25964/0:Just give a shout with the beacon when it's time for me to land.
25965/0:How's it goin'?
25966/0:
25967/0:Noise believed to be deliberate.  Possible diversion.
25968/0:... must be packin' explosives...
25969/0:Creature disturbance.
25970/0:Damn, a fire!
25971/0:Hm, smoke...
25972/0:Activity evident.  Item was closed.
25973/0:Those are encrypted files.
25974/0:Activity evident.  Item was open.
25975/0:Activity evident.  Item was powered off.
25976/0:
25977/0:Activity evident.  Item was powered on.
25978/0:If you are Order, you are fundamentalist.  You want to blow up anything that has wires or moving parts.  If you are WTO, you want everybody working in a factory.  The rest of us are caught in the middle.
25979/0:Activity evident.  Item destroyed.
25980/0:Activity evident.  Item damaged.
25981/0:Every society has organization.
25982/0:Uh, I don't know...
25983/0:I've got things under control in the immediate area.  But thanks for the offer.
25984/0:Why not make him work it off?
25985/0:Maybe I can help her get Mr. Black to pay.
25986/0:We lost WTO Security Chief Donna Morgan today, too.
25987/0:Wait here.
25988/0:My family has a long history with the Illuminati.   You might say the same of your bloodlines as well. 
25989/0:We remain enemies, true.  That doesn't mean we can't be civil to each other.
25990/0:Someone got juiced.
25991/0:Yo!  Who's blocking the light?
25992/0:I love Nature as much as Her Holiness.  But Nature builds and creates.  Perhaps the Order is sincere, but they have a public relations battle to win.
25993/0:Hope it's really dead...
25994/0:Well.  (clears throat)  I'm not scared of a little action...
25995/0:Activity evident.  Item malfunctioning.
25996/0:Must've been a pretty big gun to do THAT.
25997/0:Take the thing.  What do I need it for?  I run a coffeeshop.
25998/0:Wish I had the buy-in money, but I don't.  [100 credits]
25999/0:Activity evident.  Item disabled.
26000/0:Bulletholes... Good thing I know how to handle myself.
26001/0:Activity evident.  Item location has changed.
26002/0:That bot got roasted pretty bad.
26003/0:Victory will be ours...again.
26004/0:Activity evident.  Item missing.
26005/0:Looks like bad news.
26006/0:Activity evident.  Item moved.
26007/0:The situation should be resolved shortly.
26008/0:Activity evident.  Light off.
26009/0:All clear.  You could make it to the medina if you leave right now.
26010/0:
26011/0:Activity evident.  Light on.
26012/0:Activity evident.  Door opened.
26013/0:Activity evident.  Door closed.
26014/0:Was it a food additive test?
26015/0:Activity evident.  Door destroyed.
26016/0:Good grief, you killed Bob?
26017/0:Ready for an extraction, scally.  Just send word with the pilot beacon by Flight Bay 23.
26018/0:Goodbye.
26019/0:I don't know exactly what I'm guarding, but I know it's of no interest to you. 
26020/0:Because I think Her Holiness is a fiction.  That's right -- a fiction.  Why doesn't she show her face when she appears in public?
26021/0:I didn't get a chance to read the file.
26022/0:
26022/1:
26023/0:Oh.
26024/0:An unfortunate circumstance for both parties.
26025/0:I hope Her Holiness is safe...
26026/0:I hope the purification process reverses most of the damage.
26027/0:You're in the way.
26028/0:He's not working for Tarsus and it sounds like he wants to hurt us.  We are better off hiding for now.
26029/0:I think it's a prison break.  First, too many scabs suddenly have work.  Second, what gets scrip'ed?  The Inclinator.  Metro.  All the TRANSPORTATION, see?  Third, no one takin' these jobs knows what they're for.
26030/0:And you wonder how dictators can stay in power.  It's because people will suffer almost anything rather than risk changing the way they live.
26031/0:What do I need to do?
26032/0:No thanks.
26033/0:Sure, Her Holiness comes to town NOW -- but it is just a show.  We need action, not more talk.
26034/0:Evidence of recent hostility...
26035/0:What the --
26035/1:Good God!
26036/0:Ah, Alex D.  Chief Morgan has had a lot to say about you.  
26037/0:Alex, let's talk.  Meet me at the visitation room down the hall.
26038/0:I'm a little confused.  I heard through the grapevine that you gave the WTO a tip that led to the assassination of the VIP Mr. Levine was so keen on protecting.  You playing both sides?
26039/0:First that stuff in Nassif's office and now this...  Tarsus has been lying to us.  But I have friends planning a rescue -- this code yellow is probably a sign they're on the move.
26040/0:Hm.  Some kind of movement...
26040/1:I saw SOMETHING...
26041/0:I see you!  // threatening
26042/0:I looked around the school.  Your daughter had a close call, but she's fine.  The new headmaster is working for the Templars -- some sort of plot to murder the most talented students and their families.
26043/0:Closer to home now.
26044/0:You there.  Hey!
26045/0:Huh.  My ears aren't what they used to be.
26045/1:I heard SOMETHING...
26046/0:Hm, bumped into something...
26047/0:(grunt) Hell, I'm bein' AMBUSHED!
26047/1:(grunt) Who's there?!  You better stand down.  
26048/0:So much for the rescue attempt.  At least he will not have to suffer the Templars' experiments.
26049/0:Seen that one before...
26049/1:You might've gotten away with that against a rookie...
26050/0:Very funny.  You know, you don't seem very shy to ME.
26051/0:No time to chat -- get to work.
26052/0:That's blood all right.
26053/0:I am satisfied.  Nothing remains that can challenge the Grand Masters.
26054/0:You are a Denton rev.  I am the latest rev 2.0.1a from the Xeta-Q gene line.  Perhaps our specs will converge in the next generation.
26055/0:Sid Black.  Call me Sid.  Best jet-jockey in the Northern Hemisphere.  So you're on your own?  If you need a lift, I'm game.  All you've got to do is bail out my jet and give me a little something for my trouble.
26056/0:You know what I'd like to see?  I'd like to see a Pequod's open up down here.
26057/0:What's happening?  I've heard strange stories about Her Holiness.
26058/0:We're lucky you came along when you did.
26059/0:Don't tell me.  You're one of them big-city reporters thinks he's gonna bluff the management into giving him a peek at the new weapon.
26060/0:Her Holiness be damned!  I should have known it was a stupid idea.  Who am I?  I'm just a medina kid who got a lucky break.  This won't be the first time a respectable entrepreneur turned into a toothless beggar.
26061/0:They may never know how we have shaped the world for them.
26062/0:If you give me the code, I'll take care of it.
26063/0:I won't forget this, Alex.
26064/0:We have good reason to believe that ApostleCorp's headquarters are in Cairo.  This is where she would go looking for help.
26065/0:An admirable gesture regarding my brother.  I will be waiting for you in the Statue.
26066/0:Leila was the first of us "scabs" to go to the Tarsus Academy in the arcology.
26067/0:Bosh!  Let's rip.
26068/0:
26069/0:The lesson of the Collapse is that we need to learn to live as human beings.
26070/0:Must've been a standoff here.
26070/1:The fighting seems to have tapered off.
26071/0:Fire, probably some sort of diversion.
26071/1:Someone's setting fires...
26072/0:Something must be burning.
26073/0:Someone killed a mutant.
26074/0:Some sort of commotion...
26075/0:That damage looks recent.
26076/0:Hm.  Completely destroyed.
26077/0:I think I'll stay outside rather than catch any more heat for today's fiasco.
26078/0:Hm.  Malfunctioning...
26079/0:
26079/1:
26079/2:
26080/0:All I want is a life in the arcology.  I don't care where I have to live.
26081/0:Yes?  Do you have the password?
26082/0:Maybe this is what it's all coming to -- no right or wrong, just choosing sides and hiring guns.
26083/0:Here you go.  You're the one with combat training.  Please handle the intruders before they reach my companion and me.
26084/0:I have too many good things happening for me at QueeQueg's to chain myself to some political movement.  My only enemy is Pequod's, and our battlefield is the customer.
26085/0:Femi!  Yes...!  At last.
26086/0:Yeah, clean as a matador.... The Green Lady likes to take her time...
26087/0:This isn't worth it.  You finish your fool's errand and I'll go back to the Templars.  Deal? 
26088/0:Let's pray that she is.
26089/0:
26089/1:
26089/2:
26090/0:Go on about your business.
26091/0:Yes -- superstars.  Miss Withers, the manager for NG Resonance, just ordered a tall Pequachino on ice.  You heard that NG is having a concert here tomorrow -- right?
26092/0:I'd like to schedule an appointment --
26093/0:Hm.  It's been disabled.
26094/0:
26095/0:Be careful of Luminon Saman.  
26096/0:Someone must've turned it on.
26097/0:Someone must've turned it off.
26098/0:Someone turned on the light.
26099/0:Personally, I'm not going to waste my time saving the planet until we find out where Dr. Nassif is hiding.
26100/0:Someone turned off the light.
26101/0:That wasn't open before...
26102/0:That wasn't closed before...
26103/0:
26103/1:
26104/0:Good.  Now get inside the main complex.  If it was me, I'd try to get past the guards and automated security without being seen, but if you've got to fight remember that bots and other electronics are most vulnerable to EMP attacks.
26105/0:Unconscious.... Hm.
26106/0:
26107/0:Hm, dead.  I don't like it.
26108/0:(sigh)  Someone sure did a number on him.
26109/0:Don't underestimate the Templars.  Saman has amassed a great deal of support and resources for his cause.
26110/0:
26111/0:Not my concern.  There is always strife.  I ask because I can make a deal for someone who could get into the New Cairo arcology and do QueeQueg's a favor.
26112/0:At last you have arrived, as JC planned.
26113/0:Nowhere's safe from an attack like the one that hit Chicago.
26114/0:The pads are supposed to adjust automatically.
26115/0:My people are ready.  Step into the machine inside the Statue, and they will modify your nanite architecture into a delivery vehicle for our cellular defense mechanism.
26116/0:(sigh)  Someone sure did a number on her.
26117/0:I am a prisoner!  In my own home!
26118/0:They will eventually murder him.  You can't let all our hard work be destroyed by these lunatics.  On some instinctual level, you feel a basic kinship -- you know there's bond.  Please, Alex -- save Paul.
26119/0:Who's throwing things around...?  // annoyed
26120/0:It seems to be gone.
26121/0:
26122/0:Just kill him and my people in the morgue will remove the components I need.  I like how you think.  You will be well paid.  [300 credits.]  Here, you will need this pass to enter the arcology.
26123/0:That wasn't there...
26124/0:Hm...
26124/1:Strange...
26125/0:Right...
26126/0:Well!  Maybe it IS something...
26126/1:This better not keep up.
26127/0:I talked to a dweeb in pajamas and laughed my ass off as I walked away.
26128/0:Put me down for Shutterbug.
26129/0:This is WTO Security Chief Donna Morgan.  Your were instructed to report to the air terminal.  Very well.  You can make yourself useful at the Inclinator instead.  That toxic spill needs to be cleaned up before the Inclinator can be reactivated.  No one there seems equal to the task.  The WTO would certainly appreciate it if you could help out.
26130/0:Huh.  Now what?
26130/1:It must be back...
26131/0:Must be nothing.
26131/1:Could've been anything.
26132/0:Damn, slipped away...
26132/1:Lucky beggar...
26133/0:I don't know.  I'm still reeling from the shock...   But somehow it's starting to make sense now.  
26134/0:Damn, he got away.
26135/0:The Tarsus program may be unconventional, but trust me -- we take care of our trainees.
26136/0:You risked your life?  For me?  I.... wish I had something more than a few credits to offer as a reward.
26137/0:I helped complete the immune-response code.  Your batch of trainees may very well be the answer -- the seed of 22nd-century humanity.
26138/0:What are you selling?
26139/0:What do you require?
26140/0:I can't believe that after everything you learned in meeting with the Order members that you persist in seeking out the WTO.  (sigh)  May Her Holiness watch over you.
26141/0:I didn't know SSC had plainclothes working the museum...  I guess, if you can call that "plainclothes."
26142/0:Really, Mom, I'll be fine.
26143/0:Now that the situation is under control, we're going to need to tighten regulations so this never happens again.
26144/0:May Her Holiness watch over and guide you.
26145/0:Then we agree to maintain a minimal threat profile until the crucial moment.
26146/0:Biomodification is more involved than you might imagine, Alex.  This facility was for your protection.
26147/0:Damn, she got away.
26148/0:Well.  The next assault won't be so easy...
26149/0:Convergence... convergence... peace.
26150/0:Good idea.  By the way, Chief Morgan wanted me to give you this biomod canister -- a reward for securing the Mag Rail plans at Mako.
26151/0:The killer's gone.  A shame.  A real shame.
26152/0:Damn, looks like the thief disappeared.
26153/0:Better take a look.
26153/1:Only one way to get to the bottom of this...
26153/2:Somebody up to something?
26154/0:Come out in the open.  That's an order.
26154/1:Fool.  Do you have any idea who I am?
26154/2:I always get my mouse.
26155/0:And they called it Aquinas.
26156/0:Now I've got you!
26156/1:I know just how to handle this...
26157/0:It must've gotten lost in transit.  There's no record here.  Or perhaps you did not fill them out completely?  As soon as they have your forms in order, they'll be happy to permit your investigation.  Until then, there's nothing I can do. 
26158/0:Tell Eddie I need more time.
26159/0:Hey, you!
26160/0:You won't get away!
26160/1:NOW you did it.
26160/2:I'm right on your tail...
26161/0:Aaaa!
26161/1:Holy--
26162/0:We have gathered the data we need.  Soon we will be able to halt modification entirely.
26163/0:Welcome.  The Omar trader is ready to conduct business.
26164/0:Gob-zilla's gonna eat that other gob for dinner.
26165/0:It is almost too much to comprehend right now, especially considering how fast the Templars seized control of this city.
26166/0:Also, once I'm in the air I'm not coming back to Seattle.  I'm sure you understand -- the authorities will be waiting for me.
26167/0:
26167/1:
26167/2:
26168/0:You and I both know that it's high time for the rule of law to be established both within the WTO enclaves -- and without.  Thanks for being with us, Professor.
26169/0:I'm glad I don't have to worry about transgenics on the loose around here anymore.
26170/0:I don't know....  Some kind of reactor or something.
26171/0:Excuse me?
26172/0:I said beat it.
26173/0:Gotcha!  I'm a little quicker than the regulars...
26173/1:Now what're you gonna do?
26173/2:I think you're caught.
26174/0:Time to drop this beggar...
26175/0:Sure.  Wanna keep a low profile?  Manage the line-of-sight situation.  Hide behind things.  Watch where the enemy's head is facing.  And listen.  I'm always surprised how much these amateur commandos give away by talking to themselves during a fight.
26176/0:Thought you could get away, huh?
26176/1:Coward.
26176/2:Enough games.
26176/3:This is starting to get old.
26177/0:Five to one he's at the Greasel Pit bar, trying earn back his fine by betting on the fights.
26178/0:Alex D.  The information you provided our agent has proven valuable.  He was successful against the invaders and would like to thank you.  Your future business with the Omar will remain on favorable terms.
26179/0:Better draw your weapon.
26180/0:You know that Queequeg's coffee beans are slow-roasted in convective drums for maximum fidelity to regional flavor.
26181/0:Easy shot...
26181/1:There.
26181/2:I'm a pretty steady shot.  // warning
26182/0:Let us know when it's safe.
26183/0:She told me to send you into the medina -- the village -- to talk to the Omar in their hideout.  Supposedly they say that the WTO has technology to clean up the nanites but won't use it.
26184/0:You might like to know that your manager is taking bribes.
26185/0:There was some confusion over a shipment last night too.
26186/0:You want everyone to be like the Omar and meld themselves together into one huge AI construct?
26187/0:Enough talk.  It only makes me angry.
26188/0:Suite 2226.
26189/0:Mina!  Did you hear that?
26190/0:I knew you would save us!
26191/0:Thanks for the help.  Mr. O'Rourke appreciates it.
26192/0:Yeah, I've met two of the other trainees.  I wasn't impressed.  Just like our first day at Chicago Tarsus, years ago.  There's never any decent competition.
26193/0:Untested and volatile nanotechnology, bought and sold on the streets. 
26194/0:As long as you follow the rules, there will be no problem.
26195/0:ApostleCorp?
26196/0:Alex, you understand that my machine taps into MJ-12's old network.  The right thing to do is make this network available, equally, to everyone on the planet.  I hope you will reconsider your allegiance to the maniac who destroyed your childhood home, along with eight million people in the surrounding area.
26197/0:Chairman Dumier of the WTO here.  I don't think you'll find your ApostleCorp official out sightseeing at the Black Gate ruins, which is where the sewer leads.  That's right, I've been following your progress.  It would be a shame to lose you to a pack of sewer greasels. 
26198/0:Threat Code Red -- Respond accordingly.
26199/0:Convergence... convergence... peace.
26200/0:Too late for runnin' away...
26200/1:Hit and run, huh?
26200/2:Don't worry -- I'll flush you out...
26201/0:It's tricky getting in and out of this place unnoticed, but there ARE ways to stay inside and out of sight...  I have never been there myself, but I have heard some kids talk about a hideout somewhere in the ventilation system.  It seems no one on the faculty knows about it.
26202/0:Listen.  Her Holiness is speaking.
26203/0:At least you know when you're beat.
26203/1:You're not getting off that easy...
26203/2:They always want to run for it.
26204/0:What's the matter?  I'm standing right here.
26204/1:You're gonna have to do better than that.
26204/2:Close...
26205/0:Must be some sort of biomod.
26205/1:This isn't the first time I've fought someone who's modified.
26206/0:I'm Bud Puckett.  Remember me?
26207/0:(grunt)
26207/1:(grunt)
26208/0:(groan)
26208/1:(groan)
26209/0:(moan)
26209/1:(moan) No...
26210/0:(gasp) (cough)
26211/0:(scream)
26212/0:
26212/1:
26212/2:
26213/0:Yes.  It's a simple repair.  I just seem to have left Trier without any multitools.
26214/0:When the Omar set their eyes on a particular market, they don't leave you much choice.
26215/0:I just wanted to give those Order freaks what they deserve.
26216/0:I already took a peek at the club's records.
26217/0:I understand your anger because of the WTO's sloppy waste management, but this destruction serves no one.  Now the hazard flush system is the only way to clean this up.  You also could just try powering up the system from the Director's office, but then you'd have to brave the cloud to get to the keypad to activate the Inclinator itself.
26218/0:I love it when you talk dirty.
26219/0:I could use a few EMP grenades.  Give me those.  [200]
26220/0:A lot of Lower-Seattle types are signing up with the Knights Templar, because the Templars want to exterminate these mutated pests.
26221/0:Yeah?
26222/0:(groan) I can't see!
26223/0:He cleans cleaner bots?
26224/0:Until our security assessment changes, Tarsus will be operating as a closed campus.  Please remain in the main complex.
26225/0:Was that supposed to hurt?
26226/0:(groan)
26227/0:(groan) Damn you!
26228/0:(grunt)
26229/0:(sigh)
26230/0:That's right -- it's for real.
26230/1:Guess you felt that one.
26230/2:What did you expect, huh?
26231/0:That is how I think Chairman Dumier must feel.  He could deregulate nanotech construction, and Symmetriad Corporation could fill the planet with New Cairo pyramids in about three years.
26232/0:Good clean shot.
26232/1:My aim just gets better.
26233/0:You will be pleased with your purchase, I am sure.
26234/0:Glad that's taken care of.
26234/1:I think that does it.
26234/2:I'm happy we could find a diplomatic solution.
26234/3:Textbook takedown.  Hm, could make good instructional material, if one of the cameras caught it.
26235/0:Damn...
26235/1:Losing my touch.
26235/2:Missed my chance...
26236/0:
26237/0:Don't forget about New Cairo.
26238/0:I pulled the grate shut for protection.  How was I to know it was gonna lock behind me?
26239/0:
26240/0:Report to Mr. Dumier.
26241/0:I heard that you stopped by the church, Alex.  Don't forget to come see me.  That landing pad is run by a local smuggler, Sophia Sak.  Looks like they've seized Sid Black's harrier -- probably as payment for phony debts.  It never hurts to have a pilot who owes you a favor.  You could pay the debt or -- better -- eliminate Sak and her henchmen for the good of the whole neighborhood.
26242/0:We know you're a person and we respected your privacy as much as we could.  We were only gathering data.
26243/0:The guard was dead.  I'm sure of it.
26244/0:Let's go after the Templar leader, Luminon Saman.
26245/0:
26246/0:Some people think they've got to get in a fight or vandalize or steal in order to have a good time.
26247/0:A black-market biomod would be great, if I could afford it.  [1000]
26248/0:It's pretty exciting being a part of history.  Maybe that had some of us distracted earlier.
26249/0:We need a common set of laws -- and one police force.
26250/0:Now what about Mr. P?
26251/0:That's Saman's private system over there.  Get access to it and make a copy of the Sequencing Module.  JC Denton won't be able to hide for long now.
26252/0:They've got to impound the vehicle now, until they get to the bottom of this.  They must be interrogating the pilot.
26253/0:I hope this is the last time I have to worry about Templars.
26254/0:Thanks for checking into all that.
26255/0:That don't scare me.  I've been gettin' in trouble since the day I was born.
26256/0:Maybe your grand-pappy was a punk.  But I bet you never fought a low-down low-town scab like me.
26257/0:The cyborgs pay for beta code.  Believe me.
26258/0:Is that a salaried position or purely ceremonial?
26259/0:
26260/0:Biotech Specialist needed in lab 12.  Stat.
26261/0:JC's plan, it will bring new evenness, and quiet your kind's hostilities.
26262/0:You going to do it?
26263/0:Hey.  I was talking to you.
26264/0:
26265/0:Show me an executive with backbone, and I'll show you an Omar with a personality.
26266/0:Orders are orders.  Can't have civilians poking around back here.  I think you should move along.
26267/0:You better let me get back to staring at this wall over here.
26268/0:
26268/1:
26268/2:
26268/3:
26268/4:
26269/0:Her Holiness is really Nicolette DuClare, the descendent of a large crime family.  This is a generated image used to brainwash seekers like yourself.
26270/0:The Order Church deceives itself.  There is nothing but cruelty in this world.
26271/0:You will appreciate our merchandise.  You may purchase now or earn a discount by providing a service to the Omar.
26272/0:Ready?
26273/0:You did?  Well, it doesn't matter anyway.  When a unit goes down, a replacement arrives within a couple of hours.  I wouldn't make it ten miles into the desert.  God, you're right, Alex -- what am I going to do?
26274/0:Uh-huh...
26275/0:
26275/1:
26275/2:
26275/3:
26275/4:
26276/0:That's why we're here -- to learn what we can from this experiment before the conspirators try to infect the rest of humanity.
26277/0:I was hoping you would show more restraint.  Our enemies will be easy to absorb once JC is revived.
26278/0:The idiot didn't follow through, though.  Tina just pumped Gob-zilla's hide full of zyme, and there's my poor Snake-eyes up against Gob-zilla squared.  Poor guy didn't stand a chance.  What I woulda paid to have the job done right.
26279/0:I've got one right here.
26280/0:Your biomod architecture is no Piezochem clone.  The trainees' DNA has been completely rewritten.  We're certain that the one called Leo would have been ineligible for biomodification without extensive gene replacement.
26281/0:Grateful?  Miscommunication?  They were shooting at us!
26282/0:
26283/0:Lesser of the evils offered at this point.  The other entities all want you to revive the man responsible for the Collapse.  What good can that possibly accomplish?  ApostleCorp wants to worship him and the Illuminati wants to try to control him.  
26284/0:The Arcology Director's office has determined that the particle haze outside the city contains highly bioactive nanotech fallout.  
26285/0:Wait here.  I'll be right back.
26286/0:Yeah, good for me and good for you, too -- if you've got any money to bet.
26287/0:I haven't seen you before. Welcome to our small medina.
26288/0:You're in the game, D.  Now get in there and shake your pom-poms for Snake-eyes.  He'll be comin' out the north chute!
26289/0:I will remain in my craft.
26290/0:ApostleCorp made your biomods.  I'm not blaming you, but the technology diverges wildly from Piezochem biomods, the only ones approved for sale.
26291/0:Just acting suspicious can get you in a lot of trouble around here.
26292/0:That's too hazardous.
26292/1:I can't go in there!
26293/0:You cannot help me now.  Please go away.
26294/0:That's too hazardous.
26294/1:I can't go in there!
26295/0:Order will prevail!
26295/1:May the Order guide me in this battle...
26295/2:This'll be quick.
26295/3:Heathan!
26296/0:Such a prize, mmmm...  A shame to send you straight to the chop shop.  Perhaps you heard that I'm hiring a mercenary...?
26297/0:For the Order!
26297/1:C'mon -- Let's show 'em what we're made of.
26298/0:You're not the first global church.
26299/0:For the Order!
26299/1:C'mon -- Let's show 'em what we're made of.
26300/0:Let's see who can bag him first.
26301/0:What are you doing down here?  Signing up with the Order Church like Billie?
26302/0:Let's see who can bag him first.
26303/0:Let's see who can bag her first.
26304/0:So much for the rescue attempt.  At least he will not have to suffer the Templars' experiments.
26305/0:I'm reading a camera in the area. If you think it's going to be a problem, you could try to EMP it. Or if you like to live a bit more dangerously, you could see if you can sneak past it.
26306/0:Let's see who can bag her first.
26307/0:How does it feel to be surrounded by enemies?
26308/0:Living in a nanite cloud is a strange choice, but I guess you get what you pay for.
26309/0:The Guardian grows weary.  He no longer believes in the Republic.
26310/0:What sponsor?  The company I'm supposed to go to work for?
26311/0:The terrorists are all competing for air time.
26312/0:Then you're probably trapped up on Level 110 -- or dead.
26313/0:Our protection is our own responsibility, and that's why Mako Ballistics offers handheld weapons to suit any household budget or security threat.
26314/0:I can't believe it.  She shuts herself up like a nun because of the plague.
26315/0:Then you won't be getting in.
26316/0:
26316/1:
26316/2:
26317/0:Think about it -- it's a much better deal, and no blood on your hands.
26318/0:My Seekers, you must activate your Kundalini, or your spiritual energy. As you purify your spirit in your search for true order, it will ascend from one spiritual center, or chakra, in your bodies to another. As it reaches your higher chakras, you will gain new insights, bringing your lives into deeper Order.
26319/0:See if you can come up with some money then.
26320/0:I don't think shoo is going to work on this one.
26320/1:Gotta take that thing down.
26321/0:You have your orders and I have mine.
26322/0:I don't think shoo is going to work on this one.
26322/1:Gotta take that thing down.
26323/0:Let's flip for who has to deal with THIS one.
26324/0:Let's flip for who has to deal with THIS one.
26325/0:Blasted greasels...
26326/0:Blasted greasels...
26327/0:Oh great.  Then where's the momma?
26328/0:Oh great.  Then where's the momma?
26329/0:They may be small, but they're still dangerous.
26330/0:The WTO AND the Order -- at the same place!  The city I grew up in... I can't believe it.
26331/0:They may be small, but they're still dangerous.
26332/0:Something's happening....  another squad of terrorists.
26333/0:Cash reward for information leading to the identification of Templar high priests.
26334/0:It's -- I can hardly believe it!  He doesn't really work for the WTO!  The whole organization is a sham!
26335/0:Soon, with your help, this conflict will end.
26336/0:It's the same message over and over, yet I can't pull myself away.
26337/0:
26338/0:You want a lift or not?
26339/0:Human society has been twisted and subverted by those blinded by false profits.  
26340/0:We all wake up eventually, as adults, to the handiwork of teachers, parents, civil societies -- to the materials that have been worked into us by so many skilled hands.  We are all part cyborg, biomodified or not.
26341/0:Cracking good work.  Then I'll see you at the landing pad.  You can pay me when you're ready to fly.
26342/0:Sandy!
26343/0:I hope karkians don't smell any worse when they're dead...
26344/0:Are you sure this is such a good idea?
26345/0:I hope karkians don't smell any worse when they're dead...
26346/0:Neutralizing something like this was NOT in the manual.
26347/0:Neutralizing something like this was NOT in the manual.
26348/0:You had your chance.
26348/1:You're not getting away again.
26348/2:Order is inescapable.
26348/3:Now I will finish this.
26348/4:Can't get enough of us, can you?
26348/5:We'll end this now.
26348/6:This time Order will be served.
26348/7:Knew I'd find you.
26348/8:Done making your confessions?
26349/0:You had your chance.
26349/1:You're not getting away again.
26349/2:Order is inescapable.
26349/3:Now I will finish this.
26349/4:Can't get enough of us, can you?
26349/5:We'll end this now.
26349/6:This time Order will be served.
26350/0:Is it that serious?
26351/0:I guess you just couldn't get enough of us.
26351/1:Here we go again.
26352/0:In response to the following message:
26353/0:Wanna do business?
26354/0:Then this conversation is at an end.
26355/0:I'd like to take a look at the prototype.
26356/0:I'm reading a camera in the area. If you think it's going to be a problem, you could try to EMP it. Or if you like to live a bit more dangerously, you could see if you can sneak past it.
26357/0:I guess you just couldn't get enough of us.
26357/1:Here we go again.
26358/0:I heard they don't let the gifted students get sick -- ever.
26359/0:Prepare to defend yourself.
26359/1:You'd best draw your weapon.
26360/0:Prepare to defend yourself.
26360/1:You'd best draw your weapon.
26361/0:I'm glad we found an agreeable solution.
26362/0:So you gave the order to destroy my home town...
26363/0:A new face.  Interesting.  Introduce yourself.
26364/0:Mean sons-a-bitches, that's for sure.
26365/0:Suit yourself.
26366/0:You have your orders.  Proceed.
26367/0:You know this for certain?  I can take a break and don't have to worry?
26368/0:So?!  Russell understood that people are creatures of impulse.  The role of political philosophy should be to control the destructive impulses with constructive, creative ones -- for example, allow each citizen to direct his own growth.
26369/0:I've got you in my sights now...
26369/1:Almost gotcha...
26370/0:I've got you in my sights now...
26370/1:Almost gotcha...
26371/0:Due to the pollution I've never really explored the medina.  Maybe I'll try to find that coffee stand everyone talks about.
26372/0:Cool.
26373/0:Engage the enemy.
26373/1:There's the target.  Lock on.
26374/0:Engage the enemy.
26374/1:There's the target.  Lock on.
26375/0:I was going to steal one of his expensive paintings.  I guess there's no need for that now.
26376/0:Our admiration to all those inside and out of protected enclaves.  Together, we face each uncertain day with resolve and courage.
26377/0:Here's some money for a pilot.  [500]
26378/0:Yes.  Vera Maxwell -- Executive Commander for the SSC.
26379/0:Thanks again.  That's twice now you have saved me from the Templars.
26380/0:Tell me about Bud Puckett.
26381/0:The Templars have taken the Mosque.  People seeking sanctuary there are now trapped.  The paladins are indifferent to them, but the security bot will shoot any non-Templars.  If you eliminated the bot, the people could probably escape.
26382/0:Good doing business with you.
26383/0:If they were fair about letting people live in the arcology, no one would have to worry about the Swell at all.
26384/0:Squeeze on in, sweetie.
26385/0:I have some unfinished business to take care of.
26386/0:There is no doubt now.  You are the complete solution, Alex.  The Helios core -- and the parts of JC's mind locked inside it -- have nearly recovered.
26387/0:I can take care of myself, but I might have use for a pilot later.  A long trip -- one way to New York City.
26388/0:Looks like I'll need some mech support.  Sending in the request now...
26388/1:Time to summon a bot.
26389/0:Looks like I'll need some mech support.  Sending in the request now...
26389/1:Time to summon a bot.
26390/0:What's wrong with New Cairo?
26391/0:How does that sound, darling?
26392/0:Looks like a job for a drone.
26392/1:I'm calling a drone.
26393/0:Looks like a job for a drone.
26393/1:I'm calling a drone.
26394/0:Retreat!
26394/1:Disengage!  That's an order!
26394/2:Argh!  It's too much!  Fall back!
26395/0:Retreat!
26395/1:Disengage!  That's an order!
26395/2:Argh!  It's too much!  Fall back!
26396/0:Tell me more about this "posthuman civilization."
26397/0:Surround the target!
26397/1:Don't let the enemy escape!
26398/0:Surround the target!
26398/1:Don't let the enemy escape!
26399/0:So there's ANOTHER Denton to worry about?
26400/0:Hit him from every side!
26400/1:Keep him off balance, fighting on multiple fronts.
26401/0:Hit him from every side!
26401/1:Keep him off balance, fighting on multiple fronts.
26402/0:SSC is not permitted to comment at this time.
26403/0:It's a complicated situation.  I have the key to the back stairwell of his penthouse, but I don't stand a chance against the automated security unless I get him to let me in himself.
26404/0:Endorsements for a particular brand of coffee.
26405/0:The Luminon will give you your next assignment.
26406/0:Good, the terminal defenses have been disabled.  Now go to the control room to activate the pilot beacon.  I'll be your pilot until I can resume my mission.
26407/0:No, thanks.
26408/0:We will rule from the shadows, and bring them into the light.
26409/0:Everyone signs a non-disclosure agreement when they start.  Did he think we were joking?  
26410/0:The freaks are mostly eliminated, and we captured one of their leaders, the illustrious Paul Denton himself.
26411/0:
26411/1:
26411/2:
26411/3:
26412/0:First they run me out of the Lord's house, then they chase me out of the tunnels.  (laugh)
26413/0:We were momentary allies against a common enemy -- not much more than that.  Then he became this -- this THING that freezes oceans and wants to drag every man, woman, and child into God only knows what kind of wasted world.  I don't think of him as JC, as a person who can be betrayed.  He is a force of Nature, an element to be overcome.
26414/0:
26414/1:
26415/0:Hit her from every side!
26415/1:Keep her off balance, fighting on multiple fronts.
26416/0:You're just one man.  It's not wise to start a war before you know your enemy.
26417/0:You found him.  Good.  I doubt he'll just hand over the keys to his penthouse, though.  Maybe one of the other patrons knows him and can give you a clue.
26418/0:Hit her from every side!
26418/1:Keep her off balance, fighting on multiple fronts.
26419/0:Slowly but surely, let's push forward.
26419/1:Watch the enemy...  Move in...
26420/0:My instructions forbid me to say.
26421/0:Slowly but surely, let's push forward.
26421/1:Watch the enemy...  Move in...
26422/0:Full assault!
26422/1:Let's go!  
26422/2:Here we come!
26423/0:Full assault!
26423/1:Let's go!  
26423/2:Here we come!
26424/0:Move NOW!  He's not ready for it.
26425/0:Move NOW!  He's not ready for it.
26426/0:Move NOW!  She's not ready for it.
26427/0:Just a simple analogy.  My enemies seek to establish States, but they forget to heed Plato's good advice: do not fail to convince the children that the gods are incapable of lying.
26428/0:Hi.  I'm NG Resonance.  What would you like to talk about?
26429/0:Move NOW!  She's not ready for it.
26430/0:How I wish we could go on talking.
26431/0:So I guess you've gone rogue on us.  It's not too late to show some loyalty to the WTO.   We want you to destroy the Nassif family's greenhouse.  Exit through the mosque on Level 108, then go west.  The experimental greenhouse, a violation of WTO regulations, should lead us to Dr. Nassif.
26432/0:Ooo, that's not pretty.
26433/0:This ain't exactly an airport up here.
26434/0:Hey you.  C'mere.
26435/0:You're starting to make me nervous, man.
26436/0:
26436/1:
26436/2:
26436/3:
26437/0:Know anything about the WTO guards at the bar?
26438/0:I'm telling the truth.
26439/0:
26440/0:That would be a tedious business.  With luck, the rumors out of Germany are true, and soon we'll start a new phase of cleansing.  Purity can be slow to achieve, or, like a revalation, it can crystallize instantly.
26441/0:You bet.
26442/0:Homicide unresolved.  Archiving evidence.
26443/0:Engagement unresolved.  Archiving data.
26444/0:Intrusion unresolved.  Archiving data.
26445/0:I will.
26446/0:Failure to locate the thief.
26447/0:It's been a pretty quiet week.
26448/0:Scan inconclusive.
26448/1:Clear.  Downgrading alert.
26449/0:Destroying lifeform.
26450/0:Heretic!
26450/1:Unbelievers will be vanquished.
26450/2:Order protects me.  You will fall.
26451/0:Guess the Inclinator's open for business.  That didn't take very long...
26452/0:Target reacquired.
26453/0:Heretic!
26453/1:Unbelievers will be vanquished.
26453/2:Order protects me.  You will fall.
26454/0:It's almost over, folks.
26454/1:The Order will prevail.
26455/0:What cover?  Lonely drunk?
26456/0:It's almost over, folks.
26456/1:The Order will prevail.
26457/0:Wish I could afford the silencer.  [600]
26458/0:And now to finish her off.
26459/0:How many times do you have to be told not to worry about what happens in other departments?
26460/0:And now to finish her off.
26461/0:Interesting.  The Order doesn't usually get tangled up in corporate rivalries.
26462/0:I guess I better just wait here.
26463/0:Good work.  The area is clear -- natural balance has been restored.
26464/0:Hurt me, and I guarantee that you won't leave the arcology alive.
26465/0:This is a maintenance area.  Limited access.
26466/0:What do you think she'll do?
26467/0:Oh...  really...  you're a graduate?
26468/0:Move along.
26469/0:The Knights Templar welcome you, friend.  Care to learn more about the Cause for Purity?
26470/0:I heard this from someone who would know.  They probably want to break up the profit-sharing in secret, so guys like us never know we've been screwed.
26471/0:Let go of the Church.  You are a Templar paladin now.
26472/0:We have been trying to persuade Panzerwerks to stop polluting this region and restore to Nature what is rightfully hers.  
26473/0:
26474/0:Look at the sky!  The Swell's gone!
26475/0:(groan) Swell 11's  won.  What a way to die.
26476/0:Whether it's a concert where people get a little out of hand or a lonely walk home late at night -- For the times when you need a little extra punch -- Horde Riot Control Products gives you the Stun Prod.
26477/0:You sound like you want a favor.  What makes you think I'll say yes?
26478/0:No weaponry detected.
26479/0:I'm here to make sure you deal straight with Miss Sak.
26480/0:Target occluded.
26481/0:Clearing enemy position.
26481/1:Response effective.
26482/0:Lay off, lady... Jeez.  I'm just sellin' passes.
26483/0:Enemy targeting error.
26483/1:Attack evaded.  Continuing operation.
26484/0:Sir, that's close enough.  Do not approach the checkpoint.
26485/0:Analyzing system damage.
26485/1:Damage sustained.
26486/0:And now to finish him off.
26487/0:Did you hear about this Code Yellow? 
26488/0:Severe damage.
26488/1:Auxillary circuits engaged.  Reduced survivability. 
26489/0:And now to finish him off.
26490/0:Systems failing.
26490/1:Hull plates vulnerable.
26491/0:Look what followed me home.
26492/0:And you are a Tarsus man?  Yes?  Well, perhaps you can have a word with the headmaster.  I will give you my parental code: 74652.  Tarsus is on Level 107.  Tell the fat bum I want him to return my calls.  Where is my girl?  Why couldn't Leila find her last night?
26493/0:Always watching us, hurting us.  Free us from this cage.
26494/0:Extreme heat.  Compensating.
26495/0:Look what followed me home.
26496/0:As you wish.
26497/0:Sure glad I'm not the mailman.
26498/0:Doubt comes easily like a weed.  Faith is something you must cultivate if you ever want to enjoy its fruits.
26499/0:Negligible damage.
26500/0:Sure glad I'm not the mailman.
26501/0:What is the little sprout's answer?
26502/0:Yeah?
26503/0:You may have that spit, but I've got THIS.
26504/0:You may have that spit, but I've got THIS.
26505/0:I'm glad you're all right.
26506/0:I've been following the ApostleCorp investigation very closely.  Your loyalty in this matter would be a great asset.  However, we have a more pressing crisis.  Her Holiness is missing, along with my security chief, Donna Morgan.  By chance was this on the agenda for your meeting with that old curmudgeon at the Nine Worlds?
26507/0:Thank you.
26508/0:Well, thanks for the credits.  I better be going.
26509/0:
26510/0:Not exactly -- some sort of decomposition process that will create a toxic vapor.
26511/0:Targeting accurate.
26511/1:Ranged weapon successful.
26512/0:The cost of a good defense lawyer.  Give me the money and I'll keep your dirty secret.  [750 credits]
26513/0:I hope he's okay.
26514/0:Trying to get to the roof?  First you'll have to deal with that beam trigger. If you're running low on multitools, you could just destroy it with an explosive.
26515/0:Threat neutralized.
26515/1:Countermeasures successful.
26516/0:The event happened in the greenhouse, where Leila and her parents were hiding.  No one knows who the killers were or what they wanted.
26517/0:Just got the thrusters cranked.  This bird sings so loud now my head's ringin'.
26518/0:The city's under martial law, but the attacks on Seekers continue.
26519/0:The whole reason I joined the Order was to get away from factory-model thinking.
26520/0:Yeah, sure, they're cute when they're little...
26521/0:Coordinating with additional unit.
26522/0:Yeah, sure, they're cute when they're little...
26523/0:Summoning additional units.
26524/0:Lucky shot!
26524/1:You want a piece of me?!
26525/0:Summoning medical bot.
26526/0:Lucky shot!
26526/1:You want a piece of me?!
26527/0:You better talk to someone.  Exoskeletal armor can break bones if it doesn't fit right.
26528/0:Summoning repair bot.
26529/0:I'm on fire!
26529/1:Water!
26530/0:Negative result.  Altering heuristic.
26531/0:I'm on fire!
26531/1:Water!
26532/0:I don't feel so good.
26532/1:The room is spinning....
26533/0:Let's take out the Illuminati Grand Master, Chad Dumier.
26534/0:I don't feel so good.
26534/1:The room is spinning....
26535/0:I'll take a chance on the Claw.
26536/0:I can't see!
26536/1:Ungh -- that stings!  I'm blinded!
26537/0:If only I could get away from all this, I just know I could be a poet.
26538/0:I can't see!
26538/1:Ungh -- that stings!  I'm blinded!
26539/0:Uh... dumpster diving?
26540/0:Sure.  I've got your back.
26541/0:Not exactly.  I --
26542/0:I decided I don't want to end up like you, the pawn of an ambitious AI construct.
26543/0:Excellent.  My technicians on Ophelia are already configuring the first operational Aquinas Hub in a generation... one which is in orbit and safe from tampering.  Now make sure that both Denton brothers are dead, and destroy their illegal machine.
26544/0:Head down, Claw!  Head down!
26545/0:You can't really compare two hot spots in Seattle to the obliteration of an entire city.  I don't think we're a target in the same way Chicago was.
26546/0:Is that you out there, Alex?  I saw one of the leaders go down.  They're made of flesh just like you and me.  Forget their schemes.  Wipe them all out and destroy whatever it is JC Denton built inside the Statue.  I'm serious.  Meet me at the comm van if you want some help.
26547/0:... cages for mutated animals... a lot of locked file cabinets...
26548/0:It's some sort of utopian vision they have -- a society based on absolute equality.  Meanwhile, everyone wants a piece of the technology, including the Order and WTO, which are both puppets of a contemporary incarnation of the Illuminati, believe it or not.  And of course the Templars want to destroy it.
26549/0:Pathway blocked.
26550/0:Can I help you?
26551/0:Doorway blocked.
26552/0:Explosive deployed.
26553/0:
26553/1:
26554/0:Live explosive detected.
26555/0:I really need to be getting back.
26556/0:Proximity device detected.
26557/0:This one means business.
26557/1:I've still got some fight left in me.
26558/0:Targeting error.
26558/1:Weapon system re-aligned.
26559/0:This one means business.
26559/1:I've still got some fight left in me.
26560/0:Termination authorized.
26560/1:Tactic anticipated.
26561/0:I'm not finished yet.
26561/1:(groan)
26562/0:Success probable.
26562/1:Implementing battle resolution.
26563/0:I'm not finished yet.
26563/1:(groan)
26564/0:Target employing biomods.
26565/0:(grunt)
26565/1:(gasp) Ommm...  ommm...  (gasp)
26565/2:(groan)
26566/0:(grunt)
26566/1:(groan)
26567/0:I hope nothing else goes wrong.
26568/0:Oof...
26568/1:Ouch!
26568/2:(grunt)
26568/3:Ugh.
26569/0:Oof...
26569/1:Ouch!
26569/2:(grunt)
26569/3:Ugh.
26570/0:(groan) ...to a better place...
26570/1:Her Holiness, watch over me...
26570/2:Omm... (gurgle)
26570/3:Noooo...
26571/0:(groan) ...to a better place...
26571/1:Her Holiness, watch over me ...
26571/2:Omm... (gurgle)
26571/3:Nooo...
26572/0:That takes care of the power.  Now get downstairs to load the Sequencing Module.
26573/0:Saman really is a Templar?
26574/0:
26575/0:The Omar are an application of anagenetic evolution to rapid environmental change.  In solving the problem of survival on a planet disrupted by wars and self-replicating hazards, we have solved other problems.  The specimen you examined was a similar attempt to solve these problems.
26576/0:
26577/0:That's good to hear.
26578/0:Maybe I'll check back with you later tonight.
26579/0:Enemy moves at trans-human speed.
26580/0:Tell you what.  I'll give you Mr. Levine's usual hitman bounty plus fifty percent to go back to that facade of a nightclub and murder the VIP he's so keen on protecting.  [450 credits]
26581/0:(bleep)
26581/1:(static)
26581/2:(pops)
26582/0:Must be a one-size-fits-all operation.
26583/0:
26583/1:
26583/2:
26584/0:Target assessment: vulnerable.  Proceeding.
26584/1:Calculating mission risk.... negligible.
26585/0:It is almost too much to comprehend right now, especially considering how fast the Templars seized control of this city.
26586/0:Target assessment: average.  Proceeding.
26586/1:Calculating mission risk.... acceptable.
26587/0:Target assessment: formidable.  Accessing tactical database. 
26587/1:Calculating mission risk... substantial.
26588/0:Are you nuts?  Why are you powering up the system?  That toxic gas is still flooding the Inclinator compartment. If you try to ride to Lower Seattle without cleaning up the spill, you're going to have to wade through the mess to get to the keypad to activate the Inclinator.
26589/0:Need a pass or what?
26590/0:System failure.
26591/0:Alex, if you're trying to get to Lower Seattle, you're stuck.  There's been a toxic spill at the Inclinator -- the only way to travel there.  The hazard flush system or a nanoformer bot could clean up the mess, but the maintenance team is blocked from using either.  Maybe you could help out?  For more details, talk to the facility director in her office.
26592/0:Combat support required.
26593/0:Fulfilling directive.
26594/0:Guess I can forget about collecting that fine.
26595/0:Hey, I don't have much in the way of a reward, but this showdown just got me a big bonus and put me in tight with the Omar.  You're welcome to half.
26596/0:You've already seen the lab, so I guess it won't hurt anything for you to install a few biomods.  You'll be needing them.
26597/0:What changed your mind?
26598/0:The Order needs all the information you can find   Look around for some details about what they were talking about.
26599/0:As you wish.  I will meet you on the rooftop next to the tavern.
26600/0:Who made it?
26601/0:
26602/0:Are you his new chamber-boy?
26603/0:Sure.
26604/0:I can't risk putting the Inclinator back online until we're sure the area's decontaminated.
26605/0:Move it.
26606/0:Scanning.
26606/1:Processing.  
26606/2:Surveyed region clear. 
26607/0:Her Holiness is waiting for you.  She will help you in this search.
26608/0:(whispering data transmissions)
26608/1:(muffled bleeps)
26608/2:(whispering voices)
26608/3:(whispering voices)
26609/0:Good luck with your search.  Whenever I'm looking for someone in Trier, I start at the Nine Worlds Tavern on the west side of the city.  Your odyssey is beginning to intrigue me, Alex.
26610/0:New file opened.  Your actions will be recorded.
26611/0:It's simple enough, shoot at anyone who crosses the line.  I can do that.
26612/0:Interference with security systems is a criminal act.
26612/1:Unauthorized contact.
26613/0:Do not linger.
26613/1:Curiosity noted.
26614/0:Behavior heuristic unnacceptable.
26614/1:First warning: go about your business.
26615/0:Clearance denied.  Return to your place of origin.
26616/0:Threat classification: minor.
26616/1:Interference with security platforms: not advisable.
26617/0:Well, as you can see, the students are hard at work, as usual.  
26618/0:Minor infraction.  Protocol forbids retaliation.
26619/0:Violation noted.
26620/0:Pfwww!  You're modified.  I can smell it on you.  
26621/0:Who'da thought?  One minute I'm a nothing trainee, then the fate of the world all depends on what I decide to do.
26622/0:How'd Gob-zilla get killed?
26623/0:But I also have access to better-quality protection, thanks to mercenaries like you.
26624/0:
26625/0:I need a matter clip.  I'll take it.  [200]
26626/0:Well... at least we tried.  Here's your money.
26627/0:Tarsus is a front for something called ApostleCorp.  They gave us an experimental biomod architecture -- one that can supposedly reconfigure anybody's DNA to accept nanite infusions.
26628/0:I wasn't sure about you at first, but you turned out to be a good woman.
26629/0:I thought you were going to pillage the biomod laboratory....  You may as well double back and get the infusions, since we're going to have to cut you loose for a while.  I'll give you the code to the elevator when you're done.
26630/0:We'll see about all of this.
26631/0:Still breathing... Hm.
26632/0:
26633/0:Another piece of meat...  // world-weary  
26634/0:Someone knocked out one of my pack...
26635/0:That does it.  Come out and fight, scab!
26635/1:Real bright, scab.  Where are ya?
26636/0:The Templars are not murderers.  We passionately want what's best for humankind and realize these dire circumstances demand certain...sacrifices.  
26637/0:Additional collisions could result in a security reclassification.
26637/1:Security platforms are authorized to protect operational capability with force.
26638/0:Listen up.  If it's one of us, it's one of them!  Move!
26639/0:Your continued interest has been classified as suspicious.
26640/0:I will complete my mission.
26641/0:Behavior heuristic classified as hostile.
26641/1:Normalize your behavior.
26642/0:Leave the area.  Requesting immediate compliance.
26643/0:Warning: threat classification has been modified upward.
26643/1:Weapons must remain concealed.  Please observe this policy.
26644/0:That's my business.
26645/0:Unlike the first Dentons, who were straight clones of an ideal individual, you were -- how do I put it...? -- average... a feeble little mongrel who was MADE into a Denton.
26646/0:Hull damage.  Subsequent damage may warrant retaliation.
26647/0:Threat classification: high.
26647/1:Violators are expected to heed all security-platform warnings.
26648/0:Final warning.  Battle systems ready.
26648/1:Threat classification: extreme.  Battle systems ready.
26649/0:Seeking additional combat units.
26650/0:Threat scheduled for elimination.
26651/0:Who the hell do you think you are?  That facility downstairs is classified.  Think you can take on all of WTO security?
26652/0:What are we supposed to do?
26653/0:Never was too lucky.  That's why I don't bet on the fights.
26654/0:Things are a little crazy around here, but luckily it's no Chicago.
26655/0:
26656/0:I saw your daughter's name in the school's recruitment database.  I moved her to the "accepted" category.
26657/0:There were not enough police to fight back against the Templars, I guess.
26658/0:I started feeling sick the moment that stuff spilled.
26659/0:I thought you were on an important mission for the Luminon.
26660/0:Retreating.
26661/0:Pursuing directional scan.  High probability of identifying target.
26661/1:Enemy activity verified.  Ready for engagement.
26662/0:That's post-Collapse war for ya -- the objective is to seize the territory inside our heads.
26663/0:Negative.
26663/1:All surveillance heuristics normal.
26664/0:I don't take any satisfaction in killing.  He's done me a favor by dying prematurely.
26665/0:Authorized.  Proceed.
26666/0:He protects us.  We help him.  These intruders came here to find him... sent a woman in. They must be stopped.  If made free, this one will help you stop these intruders. 
26667/0:Acknowledged.
26668/0:So what do you think really happened?
26669/0:Re-assembling tissues.
26669/1:Repairing wounds.
26669/2:Biological restoration in progress.
26670/0:Healing functions complete.
26670/1:Tissue viability restored.
26670/2:Finished repairing damage.
26671/0:Dissolving corpse.
26671/1:Non-living flesh.  Initiating cleanup.
26671/2:Removing organic material.
26672/0:Protein dissassembly complete.
26672/1:Success.  Body reduced to gas particles.
26672/2:Disease hazard eliminated.
26673/0:Status: recharging.
26673/1:Out of service.  Batteries recharging.
26674/0:I just work the desk.
26675/0:We plan to give people a sense of freedom and a prosperous world.  In practical, historical terms, that's about as good as it gets.
26676/0:If I ever get any real power in this organization, just wait and see.  QueeQueg's will be the only coffeeshop chain still in business.
26677/0:How's he able to control the weather?
26678/0:Wonderful, the device is operational.  Now, Alex.  Simply take a deep breath and step inside.  I'm willing to bet that this thing actually works.
26679/0:Mr. Steed!  On the contrary --
26680/0:Let us know when it's safe.
26681/0:
26682/0:Okay, I'll mark where they are.  Just give me enough credits for a doctor's visit.  My mom's sick.  [200 credits.]
26683/0:Oh -- you the woman with covert ops training?  You want to make my day?  Bring me the balance sheet for that dive nightclub.  VOX.  Down at the end of the block.
26684/0:And Mako Ballistics is reporting that terrorists have infiltrated their Redmond facility and have stolen the plans for a weapon prototype.
26685/0:Frag mod's too expensive. [1000]
26686/0:It will be a pleasure to neutralize the enemy with you.
26687/0:I knew my boy didn't stand a chance against 'Zilla, but I had to step up to the plate.
26688/0:Maybe I plan to kill him, like the Illuminati want me to.
26689/0:And you wonder how dictators can stay in power.  It's because people will suffer almost anything rather than risk changing the way they live.
26690/0:Go about your business.
26691/0:No matter what, though, it never goes away.  (cough cough)
26692/0:But nothing.  Just learn to keep your mouth shut.  I need someone in Cairo I can count on.
26693/0:They really make 'em fight to the death.  Wow.
26694/0:Request denied.
26695/0:Healing aborted.
26695/1:Failed to complete operation.
26696/0:I know what you must be thinking.  Don't worry.  This won't be a repeat of Chicago.
26697/0:
26698/0:Primary-system damage.  Repairs necessary.
26699/0:Systems (garble garble) error (garble) signal loss (garble)...
26700/0:Think like that, and they already got you scrip'ed, man.  That's their play -- make out like it was some Low-town plot and see how we react.
26701/0:Autonomous processing interrupted.
26702/0:Autonomous processing restored.
26703/0:Systems shutting down.
26704/0:You can't pass up this chance to help your fellow citizens.
26705/0:Chassis breached.
26705/1:Minor circuit damage.
26706/0:Damage significant.
26706/1:Primary circuits disrupted.
26707/0:Huh.
26708/0:System integrity failing.
26708/1:Severe damage.  Failure imminent.
26709/0:Funny.  Ha-ha, and meanwhile my daughter Eeva goes missing at the Tarsus Academy in the arcology.  All of us, hunted like greasels.
26710/0:A way to level the playing field between rich and poor.  A society is no better than the individuals it contains.  If all of them can be healthy, intellectually gifted, and self-reliant, the prospects for liberty look much better than they did early in the century.
26711/0:Your patience and fortitude will be rewarded, Lt. Archer. We must wait just a bit longer, but soon we will be free of this menace.
26712/0:Today's armor is one-size-fits-all.  You're just a unit of force in a big military machine.
26713/0:Your fate cannot be denied.  The Invisible Hand guides even you.
26714/0:That's no excuse for what you did at Tarsus.  The Order's got to be eliminated and I'm starting with you.
26715/0:We needed to know everything.  Not just the biochemistry, but how you might use it.
26716/0:Since when are there half a million Templars?  That's as big as the security force of the WTO.
26717/0:Huh?
26717/1:Eh?
26717/2:Hello?
26718/0:Training's so important because greasels all come from the same genetic line, made by a company called VersaLife, which I guess must've gone bankrupt after the Collapse.
26719/0:You should've let me help you out.
26720/0:Please get to your destination.  Your child may be in class or in the lab.
26721/0:Huh?  // startled
26721/1:Scab can't sneak up on me...
26721/2:Weird...
26722/0:Someone there?  Make a move, scab.
26722/1:This ain't gonna scrip'.  Not with me...
26722/2:Somethin' ain't right.
26723/0:I know when a situation's about to get scrip'ed.
26724/0:Another day breathing this self-replicating crud, and I'd be dead anyway.
26725/0:... processing modules... nanite-capsid upgrade... go...
26726/0:Someone there?  Just step out where I can get a better look.
26727/0:Have a good time.
26728/0:Avoiding threat.
26728/1:Danger... danger...
26729/0:I got ears...  // warning
26730/0:The biomod's too pricey for me. [500]
26731/0:Now what?
26731/1:This is startin' to give me the creeps.
26732/0:System failure.
26732/1:Signal... (static)... loss... (static)
26732/2:(bleeps)  Page fault.  Quitting.
26733/0:Guess I'm wrong.
26733/1:Pww!  Nothing.
26734/0:So what do you think really happened?
26735/0:I'm glad you were able to see through the Headmaster's facade.  He had the parents all fooled.
26736/0:Requesting assistance.
26737/0:Don't look at ME.  You thought it was somethin', too.
26738/0:Don't underestimate the Templars.  Saman has amassed a great deal of support and resources for his cause.
26739/0:Task scheduled.  Proceeding.
26740/0:Boo!  (laugh)  It's nothin', man.
26741/0:Operation normal.
26741/1:Diagnostics passed.
26742/0:Boo!  (laugh)  It's nothin', sis'.
26743/0:We have been instructed to let you pass.
26744/0:(bleeps)
26744/1:(hums)
26745/0:After the attack on Chicago, aren't you a little nervous?  Why so many transfers?
26746/0:Medical equipment on-board.  Fragile.
26746/1:Calibration disruption... (bleeps)... Reset.
26746/2:Collision.  Analyzing... Subject unharmed.
26747/0:Medical repair station, Class 2 automated device.
26747/1:Medical emergencies processed in the order received.
26747/2:Injured?  Not feeling well?  Feel free to access this station's diagnostic capabilities.
26747/3:Patient assumes full liability for any treatment dispensed by this unit.
26748/0:I like to travel.  Any mysteries you want solved in New Cairo?
26749/0:Tampering with a medical bot is a crime punishable by a jail term not to exceed twenty years.
26749/1:Damage to medical equipment will be billed to the perpetrator's estate.
26749/2:This unit is incapable of combat.
26750/0:What can we do?  I worry for the safety of Her Holiness.
26751/0:They towed in some helicopter not too long ago.
26752/0:First the school, then this!
26753/0:I'm here.  You said you had more to say about the raid on Tarsus.  What went wrong?
26754/0:Good luck.
26755/0:You got what you could out of her -- more than enough.  Hire a pilot at the Pequod's coffeeshop on Level 107.  You're going to find this Mr. Tong in Trier.
26756/0:Punk?!
26757/0:Oh well.  Thought I saw something.
26758/0:Must be hearin' things.
26759/0:Sure you don't want to reconsider?  You could become a very powerful woman, Alex.  With biomodification technology properly regulated, you would be the forerunner of a new elite.
26760/0:Scab better not try that on me...
26761/0:Just don't move in on any of my prospects.  I'll let you know.
26762/0:Probably just some scabland feeb havin' a fit.
26763/0:Just me and the gob bait...
26764/0:Yeah, and you better STAY gone.
26764/1:Scab got away from me.
26765/0:My sister went through this with her son....  Now I understand.
26766/0:You blew a circuit!  I just know it!
26767/0:Looked like an enclave type.
26768/0:Perhaps my navigation database is out of date.
26769/0:Offbrand must be lost... heh-heh.
26770/0:You're marked, man.  Hey!  Hear that?  // threatening
26771/0:You're marked, girl.  Hey!  Hear that?  // threatening
26772/0:Alex!  You were right.  The Church can survive this.  Her Holiness sacrificed Herself so that we could make the Order into the world's first truly global faith.  What an extraordinary development -- seekers standing beside enclave chairmen!  I never thought I'd see it in my lifetime.
26773/0:I represent your new supplier.  Mr. Kurczec is dead.
26774/0:In the wake of the unprecedented terrorist attack on Chicago, enclave-area residents are taking a harder look at those groups who oppose WTO expansion.
26775/0:I don't know why the plumbing for the arcology is so important, but this IS a restricted area.
26776/0:The service will be a theft.  In the basement of Club Vox in Upper Seattle the manager has hidden a cadaver.  An unusual mutant he wishes to sell to a biotech firm.  We are interested in the properties of the mutant's tissues, which are highly resistant to radiation and extreme temperature.
26777/0:I'm freezing my ass off out here.  The Omar shut down my enviro-suit remotely.  What are we gonna do?
26778/0:I can't help you any more than that.  I'm not going anywhere until the platform above has been cleared.
26779/0:May Order return, my friend.
26780/0:There were some murders here last night.  It's only fair that I warn you.
26781/0:Lieutenant.  Here is the softkey to the storage room at the back of the hangar [Hangar 24].  I need you to remove the Plague 11 files -- the ones related to the cure -- and bring them to me at the VIP overlook in Flight Bay 23.  Meanwhile, here is the key to the suite on 108.  It's time.  Shut ApostleCorp down, but do it quietly. [Attachment received]
26782/0:
26783/0:Forget it.  Scab's gone.
26784/0:I guess we'll see if it was worth my time and effort.
26785/0:(laugh) We scared him off.
26786/0:(laugh) We scared her off.
26787/0:Not worth stickin' my neck out, I guess.
26787/1:Least I came through it okay.
26788/0:Punk.
26789/0:Least I'm not the one who ended up dead.
26789/1:This ain't goin' unanswered.  Hear me?!  You're gonna pay!
26790/0:Can't believe I let the killer give me the slip...
26791/0:I'm sick of chasing down petty scabland thieves.
26791/1:Guess it's long gone by now.
26792/0:Huh.  Weird.
26792/1:Here I come, feeb.  I know you're here.
26792/2:Real smooth.
26793/0:Let's check this out.
26794/0:Given that it's been two years since they tried to infuse him, I'm guessing the procedure did not go according to plan.
26795/0:I'll feel a lot better when we're out of this place.
26796/0:Or maybe it was just a new flavor the vendor was trying to push.
26797/0:I did what I had to do.
26798/0:Anybody I know?  I spent a right many days in that town with this girl Cindy and her mangy friends.
26799/0:
26800/0:Be a good boy and run along now.
26801/0:So?
26802/0:Are you nuts?  A firefight in the arcology?
26803/0:I don't have enough cash to make a reasonable offer.  [500 credits.]
26804/0:You tellin' me you busted into Tina's apartment and killed the Champ?
26805/0:Where you hidin', feeb?
26805/1:You're about to get badland-cooked like a greazel pup.
26805/2:Don't think I won't stand up to this!
26805/3:If you're out there you're already caught.  Understand?
26805/4:That's right.  Too late to run, so you better hide.
26806/0:It has been a pleasure doing business with you.
26807/0:Easy -- we don't know who this is.
26807/1:Keep lookin'.
26808/0:Watch my back, man.
26809/0:I'm a diplomat, Brett.  Her Holiness and I --
26810/0:Sure.
26811/0:Be careful, sis'.
26812/0:I saw that.  // threat
26813/0:High Augur Chen briefed me.
26814/0:Think I can't hear that...?  What's the matter?  Stagefright?
26815/0:Checkin' out a noise.  Be ready.
26816/0:Hey!
26816/1:So.  That's how it's gonna be...
26817/0:There you are!
26817/1:You're busted, scab.
26818/0:I was monitoring your conversation with Chief Morgan.  Looking for a pilot?  I'll fly you anywhere you want if you can help me.  They're holding me and my chopper captive on the lower level of this terminal.  The passcode to the hangar holding my vehicle is 00485.  My inability to infiltrate more than this terminal's communications grid has put my mission in jeopardy.
26819/0:Get back here!
26819/1:Oh, yeah... punk.  Go cry to your scabland mama.
26819/2:C'mere!  NOW!
26819/3:Nuh-uh... You're gonna stand up to this!
26820/0:Many organizations would like to see us fail.  That's perhaps all I should say for now.
26821/0:I thought the Order was a spiritual movement.
26822/0:
26822/1:
26822/2:
26823/0:Your SMGs.... Well ---
26824/0:I can't wait until I'm back inside the arcology's atmospheric barriers.
26825/0:All I need you to do is finish off the Denton brothers.  The world doesn't need any new gods.
26826/0:You're gonna get me in trouble.
26827/0:Well...another strange visitor.
26828/0:He was a CUSTOMER.  He came to the club for recreational purposes.
26829/0:
26829/1:
26829/2:
26829/3:
26830/0:The Templars came out of nowhere.  Our intelligence people really dropped the ball this time.
26831/0:If we learn to listen to each other, we can coexist peacefully.  The WTO fully supports freedom of thought and freedom of religion.
26832/0:Her Holiness wants to bring everyone together.  It's called koinonia -- fellowship and communication.  Yeah, koinonia... I think it's Greek.
26833/0:I have faith in the SSC and the WTO.  
26834/0:We thank you once more for rescuing from the Hateful Ones.
26835/0:I'm not letting you shut them down.
26836/0:Every day I hear more rumors in the media.  Order fanatics want to destroy the enclave system, terrorists are planning attacks in the night, the Order and WTO are locked in an endless, invisible war...  Not so, citizens.  Her Holiness and I are meeting this week in Trier, Germany, to negotiate better relations.  We do not condemn religion, nor do they condemn free enterprise.  We will find common ground -- have faith in me.
26837/0:
26837/1:
26837/2:
26837/3:
26837/4:
26838/0:Be careful -- they control the whole facility.
26839/0:Help me out!  Jeez!
26840/0:Who's pleading?  I won't give you the code here -- I'll infolink it to you once you're at the entrance.  That way I'll have enough time to get away.  If you want the deal, just go to the bay door.
26841/0:He's gobmeat.
26842/0:You owe this search for true Order not only to yourself, but also to your fellow humans.  There is a Fard bi al-Kifayah, or collective duty.  You are bound to search and bring the search to others so that all may reach deeper understandings and peace.
26843/0:I've made some discoveries.  I think that you've brought me to the right place.
26844/0:Let's move on her!
26845/0:What the--!
26845/1:Aaaa!
26846/0:(growl)
26846/1:Scrip' time...
26846/2:Say bye-bye...
26847/0:Ready, punk?
26847/1:Let's DO this!
26847/2:Sca-a-a-ab ACTION!
26848/0:Any news?
26849/0:Sorry.  Accidents happen.
26850/0:Don't nobody mess with ME, man.
26851/0:Ooo, tough girl.
26852/0:You'll be fine.  Just be ready to go the instant I give the word.
26853/0:Dirty gob.
26854/0:I want to take a look at the extent of the damage.  I might be able to help.
26855/0:Watch THIS!
26855/1:Scab action...
26856/0:
26857/0:Just a minute -- can't carry anything else right now.
26858/0:Terrorists... wonder what they want...
26859/0:They say that their war against augmented and genetically engineered humans is a war against infidels.
26860/0:Guess there's not much we can do yet.
26861/0:Take the thing.  What do I need it for?  I run a coffeeshop.
26862/0:I'm sorry, the Inclinator is closed until we get this toxic spill cleaned up.
26863/0:Any hops during the next twenty-four hours, just fifty percent more than the going rate for one hop.  You can't beat that in this market.  [750 credits.]
26864/0:Sure, take out the Templars.  [1000]
26865/0:Get him!
26866/0:Get her!
26867/0:Get it!
26868/0:You're a well-tooled little automaton.  Even to you, every fiber of your being seems fitted together to fulfill some purpose you only dimly understand.
26869/0:Ain't had enough yet?
26869/1:Goin' for blood this time...
26870/0:You're all hit-and-run like a feeb throwin' rocks.  I've cooked my share of feebs.
26870/1:Thought you was shook.
26870/2:Time's up, feeb.
26870/3:Uh-huh, scrip' it or skip it, up to you.
26870/4:Bring it on, if you think you're all that...
26871/0:Thought that little boy was ghost...
26872/0:Come on.  Take a shot.
26872/1:Now we play by MY rules.
26872/2:They gave me command for a reason, you know.
26873/0:Thought that little girl was ghost...
26874/0:Back in your hole, beggar.
26875/0:Yo, over here!
26876/0:For a pretty lady like you, the going rate minus twenty percent.  [400 credits.]
26877/0:Serious.  Gob-zilla's history.  You've got a good shot at the title.
26878/0:This is the part where you try to make a break for it.
26878/1:What't the matter?  Not turning out like you planned?
26878/2:Funny way to die.  I guess you've got your reasons.
26879/0:I'm waitin'.  Bring it.
26880/0:I already picked up my gear.
26881/0:(grunt)
26881/1:(grunt)
26882/0:Incoming!
26883/0:Piece of advice -- steer clear of the Templar recruiting booth on 107.  They'll talk your ear off.
26884/0:Fire in the hole.
26885/0:Someone set a trap.
26885/1:Looks like a proximity device.
26886/0:I'm blocked!
26887/0:Transaction complete.
26888/0:It won't budge.
26889/0:What's to tell?  It's where I live, fifteen years now.... I was the first one to show up.  Guess it was abandoned during the Collapse... I don't know what's goin' on out there, but this is my home, and I'm equipped for a fight if it comes to that.
26890/0:(grunt)
26891/0:So you're modified?
26892/0:I don't live in the arcology.
26893/0:
26894/0:I wish the violence could've been avoided...
26895/0:The Pit pays.  You spread that around.
26896/0:The Order is not so aggressive in other cities.  This Saman just went extreme on them.
26897/0:In other words, you want modified people to hold their value, like real estate.
26898/0:
26898/1:
26898/2:
26898/3:
26898/4:
26898/5:

26898/16:
26898/17:
26898/18:
26899/0:It's simple enough, shoot at anyone who crosses the line.  I can do that.
26900/0:It's horrible... you go out there to do something for your family and you're willing to work, no matter how hard, whatever it takes to get into a walled enclave.  But you're worthless.  That's what they teach you.  You're not even worth five minutes of their time.
26901/0:You have your orders.
26902/0:Point and pull, drop and drool.
26902/1:Quick -- duck!
26903/0:My kill.
26904/0:Too dangerous.
26905/0:More bellyachin'... (groan)
26905/1:Always stickin' me on the line...
26905/2:Guess rank has its priveleges.
26905/3:I TOLD 'em...
26906/0:Bot, attack.  I said attack!
26907/0:Better call in the bot....
26908/0:Guess there's not much we can do yet.
26909/0:(yawn)
26909/1:(grrr)
26909/2:(cough)
26909/3:(clears throat)
26909/4:(whistles)  // WTO theme, if/when available
26910/0:Better get a med bot over here...
26911/0:Shhh.  Hold that thought.
26911/1:Wait -- I think someone's coming.
26912/0:Real cute.
26912/1:Hey.  What's the idea?
26913/0:Keep clear.
26913/1:You ran into me.  // annoyed
26914/0:Lookin' at something?
26914/1:I feel like I'm being cased.
26915/0:
26916/0:Excuse me.  Ahem.  None of that.
26916/1:Hey -- that's not allowed.
26916/2:You know better than that.
26917/0:The organization does have some image problems, I suppose.
26918/0:You're well aware that some coffee chains use polymerized flavor additives, freeze-dried beans, even coffee proteins that have been synthesized by bacteria.
26919/0:Area restricted.  Please leave.
26919/1:Sorry.  No access.
26920/0:Put that away.
26920/1:You tryin' to mug me or what?
26921/0:What are you going to do?
26922/0:Maybe so, but you have nothing to gain from murdering an old man like me.  I am quite helpless thanks to these useless bots.  I flew them into the area too quickly, not expecting the cold to be so severe.  The processors in the housing units were damaged.
26923/0:Thank you.
26924/0:Scan complete.  Your systems contain impressive innovations.
26925/0:
26926/0:Grand Master Saman doesn't have infinite patience.  It's time for you to get to work.
26927/0:I should warn you that the manager of Club Vox hired me to kill you.
26928/0:
26929/0:We've got our hands full -- most of our guards are at headquarters providing security for the summit.
26930/0:Miss Adams, I understand your grief and frustration.  The building is two-way secure for your safety as well as Tarsus's.  This will be temporary if everyone cooperates.  Incidentally, stay out of my office when I'm not here.  I respect your privacy; you should respect mine.  Please give up your search for an exit.
26931/0:You will fall.  Your culture has already disintegrated into flimsy tatters.  We are merely sweeping the streets clean.
26932/0:Hey!  Watch it!
26932/1:You better not do that again.
26933/0:And the plague lasted for years.
26934/0:... Helios core... lower platform... nanite-capsid upgrate necessary... all five processing modules... go... lower platform... below...
26935/0:Now that the Inclinator's running again, I can get back to work.
26936/0:You better listen to me.
26936/1:Hey, that's enough.
26936/2:Smart alec.
26937/0:Don't give me that look.  Move.
26937/1:Go stare at someone else.
26938/0:You're clumsy or you're pickin' a fight.
26938/1:That hurt!
26939/0:Maybe next time.
26940/0:Touch nothing.
26941/0:Your followers haven't expelled you yet?
26942/0:Stop playing games.
26942/1:You're not kidding around, are you?
26942/2:Put down the weapon right now.
26943/0:Go.  I mean it.
26943/1:Off-limits.  Don't make me use force.
26944/0:Anomaly.  Fire.  Cause unknown.
26945/0:Anomaly.  Smoke.  Cause unknown.
26946/0:Anomaly.  Blood.
26947/0:Anomaly.  Shadow.
26948/0:I need to sleep.  Please leave me alone.
26949/0:t5est.
26950/0:I don't know about this...
26951/0:Why not?  We're clearly the better soldiers.
26952/0:You might like to know that your manager is taking bribes.
26953/0:What cover?  Lonely drunk?
26954/0:How do I get there?
26955/0:My staff is skeptical, but I assure you -- my counter-nanite will work!
26956/0:We have had much luck spreading Her Holiness's word here in Lower Seattle.
26957/0:Sure, make a run at the Statue.  [500]
26958/0:Yes, at last, the old hierarchies will finally be restored.
26959/0:
26960/0:Where ya headed?
26961/0:Which side were you on?
26962/0:Anomaly.  Carcass.
26963/0:Anomaly.  Body.
26964/0:No, no... How can I knowingly work for an illegal monopoly?
26965/0:Anomaly.  Unconscious human.
26966/0:Anomaly.  Dead human.
26967/0:I've made some discoveries.  I think I'm finally in the right place.
26968/0:Network disruption verified.  An Omar has lost consciousness.
26968/1:Unconscious Omar identified.
26969/0:Network disruption verified.  An Omar has died.
26969/1:Omar corpse identified.
26970/0:Sure.
26971/0:Attempting to verify sensor disturbance...
26971/1:Very unusual.
26971/2:Event filed for further analysis.
26972/0:Recurring anomaly.
26972/1:More data acquired.
26972/2:Sensor activity continues.
26973/0:What makes you think that?  Why wouldn't she just leave?
26974/0:There has been a sudden and unseasonable temperature drop which has not as of yet stabilized.  The cause is yet unknown.
26975/0:The Guardian grows weary.  He no longer believes in the Republic.
26976/0:We offer only the finest technologies.
26977/0:
26978/0:
26979/0:Go ahead.  Lie to me.  Lie to the public and lie to the poor saps who worship you and "Her Holiness."  It will just make your day of reconning that much more devastating.
26980/0:
26981/0:
26982/0:Risk reassessment:  minimal.
26983/0:
26984/0:This is what the Illuminati wants you to do.  Destroy Paul Denton and help return biomod technology to international regulation.  Please discuss the operation with the Elite Commando waiting for you in the street.  Paul's frozen body is located in Flight Bay 24 on Level 110 of the arcology.
26985/0:It will be hazy and overcast Outside, so it is safest to remain inside the Arcology's atmospheric barriers.
26986/0:I think you quoted Merton, too.  Discoveries should be public knowledge!  They're essential for fueling science as a whole.
26987/0:I don't.... understand.
26988/0:My, my the flesh seems almost human....  You might feel a little stick.
26989/0:Logging auditory event.
26989/1:Noises.  Frequency response inconclusive.
26990/0:Logging visual event.
26990/1:Pattern recognition inconclusive.  Repeating visual scan.
26991/0:Harmless missionaries at the train station?  Or sleeper agents for a regime fundamentally opposed to commercial society?
26992/0:Alex Denton, welcome to your brother's sanctuary.  My assignment is to answer your questions and provide transportation.
26993/0:Renewed sensor activity.
26993/1:Resuming threat assessment.
26993/2:File re-opened.  Logging all sensors.
26994/0:Negative.  No threat.
26994/1:Aberration resolved.
26994/2:No further events -- area clear.
26995/0:Logging disappearance.
26995/1:Incomplete data.  Pursuit impossible.
26995/2:Intrusion likely.  Resuming basic surveillance.
26996/0:The SSC handles security for the entire Cairo arcology.
26997/0:A person.  Storing identity profile.
26998/0:Logging disappearance.  Assailant added to file.
26999/0:Logging disappearance.  Killer added to file.
27000/0:Logging disappearance.  Larceny suspect added to file.
27001/0:Activity highly probable.
27001/1:Is someone there?  Do not try to evade my sensors.
27001/2:Initiating search.
27002/0:Here you go.
27003/0:
27004/0:I have a ballistic silencer, appropriate for any caliber barrel.  Also a black-market biomod canister, enables non-Piezochem functionality.  I've also got an SMG machine gun.  As a preferred customer, you may purchase items at half-market price.
27005/0:Perhaps you fear that you will inadvertently do the bidding of the Illuminati.  Have patience.  Nothing will be the same once you have revived JC Denton.  Welcome to Antarctica, JC's sanctuary for twenty years.
27006/0:Killed in the line of duty.  At least it's noble, I guess...
27007/0:Truly, the Order is not responsible for those thefts.  Thank you for seeing the truth.
27008/0:Not just the sound barrier.  He can see us.
27009/0:Not for support staff.
27010/0:Calling themselves the Templars, heirs to the ancient sacred brotherhood, they now vow to protect Purity in the present day from biomodification, which they believe pollutes and degrades the human genome. 
27011/0:I just saw one of your Seekers being attacked by a couple factory workers.
27012/0:That's it!  Cut the mike.  Someone.... cut the --
27013/0:I remember a time when they were operational.  They were the backbone of pre-Collapse society.
27014/0:Thanks for braving that mess.
27015/0:Checking non-visible radiation.
27015/1:Scanning.
27015/2:Is someone here?
27015/3:Leave now or you will displease the Omar.
27016/0:Isolating auditory disturbance.
27016/1:Sound location calculated.
27017/0:Analyzing visual disturbance...
27017/1:Visual pattern-match.  Probable threat.
27018/0:
27019/0:Hey!
27019/1:Trouble!
27019/2:You!
27019/3:Leave now -- or I will be required to use force.
27020/0:Yeah, I've met two of the other trainees.  I wasn't impressed.  Just like our first day at Chicago Tarsus, years ago.  There's never any decent competition.
27021/0:I expect compliance.
27021/1:Pursuing sensor lock.
27021/2:You can not out-think my surveillance heuristics.
27022/0:Get down there and scrip' some backup!
27023/0:What the--!
27023/1:Danger!  Overload!
27023/2:Aaaaa!
27023/3:Unexpected... Unexpected...
27024/0:You will understand... We can sense it.
27025/0:I will eliminate the threat.
27025/1:Enemy identified.
27025/2:Switching to combat.
27025/3:Force required.
27026/0:Target reacquired.
27026/1:The enemy persists.
27026/2:Additional force required.
27026/3:I will persevere until the threat is eliminated.
27027/0:My whole life... just something they outlined on a piece of paper.
27028/0:Opponent unprepared.
27028/1:Exploiting advantage.
27029/0:Sighting.
27029/1:Locking on target.
27029/2:Selecting impact point.
27029/3:In range.
27029/4:Target exposed.
27030/0:(groan)  I can't believe you betrayed us like this.  But maybe it's not too late...
27031/0:I'll take that from you later.  I can't carry anything else right now.  ApostleCorp must be a pretty serious threat to be a concern to the Director of the WTO.
27032/0:Fellow WTO citizens, look about you at the splendor of the WTO enclaves. You enjoy a higher standard of living than anyone else in  the world.  Know this, such prosperity is not a product of corruption, and I am injured by the accusations against my office in Cairo.
27033/0:Guess there's not much we can do yet.
27034/0:This is not a drill.  I repeat: this is not a drill.
27035/0:Her Holiness is waiting for you.  She will help you in this search.
27036/0:Thanks for doing all the hard work, finding the way in here.  All I had to do was follow in your footsteps and now I'm just minutes away from completing my objective.
27037/0:We'll see about all of this.
27038/0:There were some murders here last night.  It's only fair that I warn you.
27039/0:Sending instructions to the bot.
27040/0:The scientists who ran our training.  Tarsus was a front.
27041/0:Calling a bot.
27042/0:Calling security bot.
27043/0:Calling medbot.
27044/0:Calling repair bot.
27045/0:Consequence unintended.
27045/1:Costly error.
27045/2:Mistake.  I am the one responsible.
27046/0:Enemy hiding.
27046/1:Target lost.
27046/2:Evasive maneuver.  Analyzing event.
27046/3:Yes.  The enemy is afraid.
27047/0:I'm part of the chief's personal detachment.
27048/0:Enemy escaping.
27048/1:Possible retreat.
27048/2:I am losing the target.
27049/0:While no concrete research has been done, many suspect that breathing these particles causes a higher incidence of certain chronic diseases.
27050/0:
27051/0:Alex Denton.  The Omar are watching.  You hate them, Alex.  You hate them.  They are weak and made of flesh.  Forget their schemes.  Wipe them all out and destroy the machine JC Denton built inside the Statue.
27052/0:Thank you.  I will be assuming command of this facility.
27053/0:
27054/0:
27055/0:Saman?  He's behind this?
27056/0:You shoulda seen the first match.  There was blood and acid slime hangin' from the rafters...
27057/0:I heard there was an accident in the flight bay.  Sorry to spoil your plans.
27058/0:Your brother's dead, and you're next.
27059/0:
27060/0:In a manner of speaking.
27061/0:So?
27062/0:
27063/0:That takes care of our would-be Napoleons.  Now destroy JC's machine and let's get out of here.
27064/0:Enemy unskilled.
27064/1:Favorable error.
27064/2:Enemy assault is uncoordinated.
27065/0:Enemy activating biomod.
27065/1:Cybernetic enemy.
27065/2:Valuable technology detected in enemy's tissues.
27066/0:
27067/0:(grunt)
27067/1:(grunt)
27067/2:(grunt) Damage.
27067/3:(grunt) Body injury.
27068/0:
27069/0:(grunt)
27069/1:(grunt) Significant damage.
27069/2:(grunt) Nearing damage threshold.
27070/0:(grunt)
27070/1:(grunt)
27070/2:(grunt) Cannot sustain additional damage.
27070/3:(grunt) Systems critical.
27071/0:
27072/0:Toxin.
27072/1:Harmful chemicals.
27073/0:Anything I can do to help?
27074/0:(screams)
27074/1:Emergency.  Exoskeleton burning.
27075/0:Go away!  Now!
27076/0:Eyesight disrupted -- unable to compensate.
27076/1:Sensor failure -- vision.
27077/0:Systems unharmed.
27077/1:Negligible damage.
27078/0:I've never seen anything like it.
27079/0:Explosive deployed.
27079/1:Grenade thrown.
27080/0:I don't know how many more times I can stand answering the same questions.
27081/0:I guess I should be grateful you came in to get me.
27082/0:What does it matter, as long as I have customers?
27083/0:Precisely.   We could never lead humanity as one monolithic force, at least not initially.  The Illuminati have always worked in secret, and the WTO and Order are just two of our present facades.
27084/0:He was quite the gentleman, actually.  I have everything I need.
27085/0:You're Tracer Tong.
27086/0:
27086/1:
27086/2:
27086/3:
27086/4:
27087/0:Huh?
27087/1:Hello?
27087/2:Maybe something's up?
27088/0:If he wants to peddle his overpriced Pequachinos down here, let him.  But I deserve a shot at those baby-faced executives uptown.  What I need is a hacker, someone to break into the Civic Manager's computer at the WTO terminal and approve my zoning petition.  Business is good down here.  I've got money, and I want to expand.
27089/0:We will not be separated again.
27090/0:What would this "pure democracy" look like?
27091/0:I don't want to be bothered unless you have business to discuss.
27092/0:There is no doubt now.  You are the complete solution, Alex.  The Helios core -- and the parts of JC's mind locked inside it -- have nearly recovered.
27093/0:Grenade.  Getting clear...
27093/1:Danger.  Explosive device.
27094/0:Proximity device detected.
27094/1:Grenade is armed.  A trap.
27095/0:
27096/0:(groan)
27096/1:(groan)
27097/0:I don't know how much more I can take.  My family here has been systematically murdered.
27098/0:I mean, how loyal can you be to us if you're willing to turn against your own kind?
27099/0:Uh!
27099/1:(grunt) (buzz)
27099/2:(grunt) Systems --
27100/0:Close-range attack successful.
27100/1:Enemy hurt.
27101/0:It looks like we'll be surrendering the arcology here shortly.  If you want to help out with the evacuation, see if you can find where the Templars moved the pilot beacon.  It's got to be nearby -- maybe it's up in the control room?  They have that area pretty well guarded...  Talk to the captain for details.
27102/0:Try to have a good time.
27103/0:Success.
27103/1:Enemy hurt.
27103/2:Excellent.
27103/3:Progress.
27103/4:Action effective.
27104/0:What news?
27105/0:Done.
27105/1:Situation resolved.
27105/2:The Omar have prevailed.
27105/3:Life signs negligible.
27106/0:I took care of the assassins upstairs.  You don't have anything to fear from them.
27107/0:Error.
27107/1:Failure.
27107/2:Missed target.
27107/3:Targeting heuristic failed.
27108/0:Calculating salvage value.... excellent.
27108/1:A very advanced prototype.... interesting.
27108/2:Superior systems, but inferior tactics.
27109/0:Don't tell me.  You're one of them big-city reporters thinks she's gonna sweet-talk the management into giving her a peek at the new weapon.
27110/0:Cairo Arcology Chairman Chris Ubair has recently been accused of civil corruption. Investigators are looking into some of the Chairman's business dealings and the case has just been officially filed in court.  Beyond that, we have no further details at this time.
27111/0:Omar adaptations will soon encompass every climate and biohazard on Earth -- and many more environments that may exist elsewhere.  You have earned preferred customer status -- a fifty percent reduction in prices.
27112/0:I have a good memory.
27113/0:Is the WTO really that bad?  The enclaves are safe and prosperous.  It seems like a solid foundation for the future.
27114/0:Hope they haven't sold my ride for scrap yet.
27115/0:I heard that he wound up dead.
27116/0:Seek a higher path -- seek Order.  Join us for worship at the Hartford Turbine factory in Lower Seattle.  All are welcome.
27117/0:I have analyzed your tactics and predicted your defeat.
27117/1:You will be destroyed.
27117/2:Run or expect to be killed.
27117/3:Scenario duration expected to be short.
27118/0:My attacks will not be limited to your bioelectric systems.
27118/1:My directives permit the use of force.
27118/2:Your systems will have value on the black market.
27118/3:I know how to engage a modified enemy.
27119/0:Proceeding according to expectation.
27119/1:Situation nearly resolved.
27119/2:Time-series analysis of your mistakes indicates that you will lose.
27119/3:Finishing...
27119/4:Victory indicated.
27120/0:No foolhardy maneuvers.  This isn't a game.
27121/0:High probability of success.
27121/1:Objective is reasonable.
27121/2:Nothing to indicate a serious threat.
27121/3:An uneven contest.  The enemy is expected to withdraw.
27122/0:Our most loyal customers are eligible to join the VIP club, upstairs.
27123/0:Careful tactical analysis will be required.
27123/1:Significant risk expected.
27123/2:Even contest.  Switching tactical priorities.
27123/3:A strong enemy, but my capabilities should suffice...
27124/0:The greater strength may belong to the enemy.
27124/1:Good tactics may be insufficient against this enemy.
27124/2:Great danger.  Options limited.
27124/3:It is not too late to control the scenario.
27125/0:What rumors?
27126/0:(grunt)
27126/1:(grunt)
27126/2:(grunt)
27127/0:Well, better get your buns over to the Pit.  Your gob's droppin' into the fire.
27128/0:Threat too great.  Assistance requested.
27128/1:Request backup.  Urgent.
27128/2:Need additional Omar to ensure victory.
27129/0:Responding.
27129/1:Mission accepted.
27129/2:Ready to coordinate.
27130/0:I heard that the Omar began in Russia.  Apparently some people went to extremes to survive the post-Collapse winters.
27131/0:Guess it's my lucky night.  Gob-zilla got cooked in her own cage.  Snake-eyes blew it, but wait and see.  No lap-lizard named the Claw's gonna hold the title for long.
27132/0:What do you mean "no comment"?  I saw a man die.
27133/0:.... like an obsessive-compulsive housewife on pequod's...
27134/0:You run a strict operation here.
27135/0:You must know all the ins and outs of this building.
27136/0:To accomplish these ends, they have officially left the Order church and armed themselves.  Grand Master Saman, a former luminon in the Order, has stepped forward to clarify their agenda.
27137/0:I hope this is a psychological tactic on Nassif and not you stalling so you can carry out some vendetta.  I will uphold the WTO's regulations and stop you myself.
27138/0:These arcology types want to be perfect and live forever, so they pour money into this stuff.  But this stuff's not people.  It's dead.  It's dead money and polycarbons.
27139/0:Fair enough.  Please, don't let me interrupt your work.
27140/0:Let me introduce myself.  Leila Nassif, Director of the Tarsus Academy here in Seattle.
27141/0:Looks like your good friend Billie Adams is a step ahead of you.  She is guarding one of the AI's processing modules with the help of bots, probably in preparation for sabotage.  I hope you two weren't too close, because one of you will probably have to die.
27142/0:We have committed acts of violence only when we believed it could save billions of pure human lives.  A few casualties are a reasonable price to pay to preserve humanity itself.  In the end, people will be grateful for our bravery and vision.
27143/0:Back to downtown.
27144/0:Why don't you tell him yourself?
27145/0:Oh?  Really?  That's hard to believe.  The SSC people keep this place air-tight.
27146/0:Just a glass of sherry... and some conversation... Please don't scare him off.
27147/0:Hello there!  You must be Alex.  I'm Klara Sparks.
27148/0:All is lost now.  Everything!
27149/0:
27150/0:I heard that the Omar began in Russia.  Apparently some people went to extremes to survive the post-Collapse winters.
27151/0:Some of us still worship the old gods, despite everything that's happened.
27152/0:Yeah, I'm working for the Order Church.
27153/0:At least it's interesting down here at this hour.  I'm sure they're all in bed in Upper Seattle. 
27154/0:Close to what?
27155/0:Do not interfere.
27156/0:Sheila, we're still waiting on that inventory audit.  In particular, we need numbers for servomechs, energy clips, rotator bearings, and coffee from your department.
27157/0:You shouldn't be hanging around this place.
27158/0:The Order teaches us to put our humanity first -- a value that should not need to be argued or preached at all.
27159/0:I don't know how I feel about that....  Where's the honor in fighting a battle from a control pod two thousand miles away?
27160/0:They've set up in the abandoned Hartford Turbine factory.  You a Seeker?  You don't look the type.
27161/0:We need a new generation of leaders -- and a plan for the generation after that.  Succession within the Illuminati is usually confined to about a dozen families, most of whom were wiped out first by MJ-12 and then by the Collapse.  As for Nicolette and myself, we were unable to have children.
27162/0:There was a time when we were the rebels.  The older generation had failed us in so many ways.  But now we see that the flaw was in their methods, not their intentions.
27163/0:You're gonna get me in trouble.
27164/0:If only I could get away from all this, I just know I could be a poet.
27165/0:I can't leave these bots unattended, or they might fall into the hands of one of our enemies.
27166/0:
27167/0:
27167/1:
27167/2:
27168/0:The people will welcome true equality.  Help me, Alex.  You've come this far toward restoring ApostleCorp.  Finish the job by rescuing my brother from the Templars in Cairo.
27169/0:Templar HQ is very pleased with the research and development of the armor you've done here in Cairo.
27170/0:I like talking to my fans.  Come back when you have something else to discuss.
27171/0:Hmmm, some sort of monomeloecular mesh....  Let me try a different needle.
27172/0:Nice try.  Sorry.
27173/0:Stand clear.  I'm about to land.
27174/0:It's a shameful distraction.  A bunch of potentates wining and dining.  Plus, they bring in their own coffee.
27175/0:This is the apartment of Dr. Nassif's uncle.  Look around for clues.  Perhaps Dr. Nassif contacted him when she arrived in Cairo.
27176/0:
27177/0:Sounds like a walk in the park.  You stay here and guard the entry.  I'll find Nassif.
27178/0:You must mean Billie and the Templars.  I guess she's already passed through this way.  Did she take any Templars with her?
27179/0:You are nearing my limit.  
27179/1:You would do well to stop testing my temper.
27180/0:Once more, and my patience will have expired.
27180/1:You are about to cross the threshhold.
27181/0:Where JC and Paul failed their intended purposes, you will soon succeed.
27182/0:Behavior returning to within appropriate bounds.
27182/1:I am pleased to see you behaving properly again.
27183/0:Now is not the time.
27183/1:Too dangerous for conversation.
27184/0:Hello.
27184/1:Greetings.
27184/2:Good day.
27185/0:With your background, you should have no problem sneaking by the camera or taking it out with an EMP.
27186/0:Hello.
27186/1:Greetings.
27186/2:Good day.
27187/0:Yes.  Over there.
27187/1:Yeah.  That way.
27188/0:How do I get in?
27189/0:No.  
27189/1:Nothing notable here.
27190/0:Leave at once.
27190/1:You can't come this way.
27191/0:I'm a man of the cloth, dear child!
27191/1:Is that a weapon?  Put it away, friend.
27192/0:
27193/0:How 'bout those weapon mods you told me about?
27194/0:Maybe I can settle things on Mr. Black's behalf.
27195/0:This won't be the first time I got paid overtime after someone forgot to send me home.
27196/0:He's not working for Tarsus and it sounds like he wants to hurt us.  We are better off hiding for now.
27197/0:(gasp)
27198/0:(gasp)
27199/0:I know a chopper pilot who might be available.
27200/0:Direct hit!
27200/1:Like shooting greasels in a sewer!
27200/2:Her Will be done...
27200/3:That's what I like!
27200/4:Yeah!
27201/0:But the tasks grow in strangeness and complexity.  The demands of others corrupt you.  All because you allow yourself to be something other than human.
27202/0:Direct hit!
27202/1:Like shooting greasels in a sewer!
27203/0:I want to hear what you know about the terrorist attack that led to your escape from Tarsus Academy.
27204/0:I got him!
27204/1:Oh yeah -- he's toast.
27205/0:I got him!
27205/1:Oh yeah -- he's toast.
27206/0:
27206/1:
27207/0:I got her!
27207/1:Oh yeah -- she's toast.
27208/0:I got her!
27208/1:Oh yeah -- she's toast.
27209/0:That's what you get for messing with me.
27209/1:How do you like that!
27210/0:That's what you get for messing with me.
27210/1:How do you like that!
27211/0:What?
27211/1:Hey...
27211/2:(humming, interrupted) --Eh?
27211/3:What's that?
27211/4:Huh?
27211/5:Strange.
27211/6:Hm?
27211/7:Probably nothing.
27212/0:Strange...
27212/1:Hmm?  I'm too unfocused.
27212/2:Maybe I'm just getting edgy?  I'm not sure.
27212/3:That's really weird.
27212/4:I wonder what that is already.
27213/0:I don't think we have anything to worry about.
27213/1:Probably nothing, eh?
27214/0:That noise...  Hmmm....
27214/1:Those noises are getting on my nerves. 
27215/0:I do not know what the Templars are planning, but I know it cannot be good.
27216/0:I'm pretty sure I saw something... I just don't know what.
27216/1:What's that?  I can't see for sure.
27217/0:I'm beginning to wonder what's going on here.
27217/1:This is starting to add up.  Hmmmm....
27217/2:There it goes again...
27218/0:Is someone there?
27218/1:I'd better look into this.
27218/2:You've got my attention now.
27218/3:That might be something.
27218/4:Maybe I should report this.
27218/5:I'll find out what this is about.
27218/6:Hello?
27218/7:Suspicious activity...
27219/0:Someone's going to be sorry... 
27219/1:I want answers -- now.
27219/2:Finally, something to do.
27219/3:Something's definitely going on.
27219/4:I'll get to the bottom of this.
27219/5:Might be nothing, but I've got to be sure.
27219/6:Hello?  Is that you?
27219/7:This isn't funny.
27220/0:Maybe they're testing us.  Let's go.
27220/1:Looks like we've got some activity here.
27220/2:I think someone's here...
27221/0:We have our differences.  Maybe I care a little more about some things -- purity of the soul and all that.  But that doesn't mean we can't get along.
27222/0:I don't think I'm just hearing things.
27222/1:Such weird noises....  I need to look into this.
27223/0:We must carefully control access to the nanotechnology you possess.
27224/0:Thank you again for your help.
27225/0:Never can be too careful.  These kids are pretty clever.
27226/0:Here's that biomod.
27227/0:Hush up.  Talk about gettin' us FIRED...
27228/0:Sometimes they talk to me.
27229/0:I'd put down some money to see NG promote QueeQueg's.  [500 credits.]
27230/0:A Headmaster's work is never done.
27231/0:Why did you expect to find an international airport?
27232/0:May you now find Order...
27232/1:At last, it's over...
27232/2:The Search sometimes demands violence.
27232/3:Return to nature.
27232/4:May Her Holiness watch over your spirit.
27232/5:That does it.
27232/6:Another lost soul...
27233/0:May you now find Order...
27233/1:At last, it's over...
27233/2:The Search sometimes demands violence.
27233/3:Return to nature.
27233/4:May Her Holiness watch over your spirit.
27234/0:
27235/0:Rest, now that the chaos in you is quelled.
27235/1:I wish it wouldn't have come to this... but I did what I had to do.
27236/0:Rest, now that the chaos in you is quelled.
27236/1:I wish it wouldn't have come to this... but I did what I had to do.
27237/0:We were chosen to succeed.
27237/1:(sigh) Why don't they just believe?
27238/0:Any tips?  You must know the floorplan by heart.
27239/0:We were chosen to succeed.
27239/1:(sigh) Why don't they just believe?
27240/0:Missed!
27240/1:Must relax...  Allow Order to guide my hand...
27241/0:Missed!
27241/1:Must relax...  Allow Order to guide my hand...
27242/0:I can't get a clear shot.
27242/1:Target lost.
27242/2:Come out and fight!
27242/3:Come on back!  You're not helping yourself.
27242/4:Be warned -- my ekaggat is strong.  I'm not easily deceived.
27243/0:I can't get a clear shot.
27243/1:Target lost.
27243/2:Come out and fight!
27244/0:Sure. [20 credits]
27245/0:Do I LOOK stupid?
27246/0:I don't like the looks of this.
27246/1:Out of the corner of my eye... I'd better investigate.
27247/0:I'm ready for action now.
27247/1:You've got my attention.
27247/2:Hey!  I'm onto you now.
27247/3:Come back here!
27247/4:I will find you.
27247/5:Enough of this.
27247/6:Show yourself!
27248/0:We're onto you now.
27248/1:Find this troublemaker.
27249/0:I will keep this zone secure.
27249/1:Step out where I can see you clearly.
27249/2:I'm not joking!  Give yourself up!
27249/3:Okay, last chance... I'm warning you...!
27250/0:What the...?!
27250/1:By Her Holiness!?
27251/0:I guess I was imagining things.
27251/1:Hmm?  I need to spend more time in meditation...  
27252/0:I must be hearing things.
27252/1:Just random sounds, I guess.
27253/0:Maybe it was an otherworldly vision...  Her Holiness trying to tell me something?
27253/1:I guess I didn't see anything after all.
27254/0:Someone was poking around, but the area's clear now.
27254/1:Looks like my unauthorized visitor has taken off.  Smart decision, there.
27255/0:What happened?
27255/1:Whoa, something must be going on.
27255/2:Never a good sign.
27256/0:It looks like it's safe around here now.
27256/1:I guess I can relax.  Looks like the thug moved on.
27257/0:Trouble must be coming.
27257/1:That bodes ill.
27257/2:What are you running from?
27258/0:Not only do you need to work on your error-checking there in Cairo, but apparently you also need to learn to return video mail messages.  It's been SIX hours and I still haven't heard anything back about the design glitch I reported.  I demand an immediate response.
27259/0:But where does the Order fit into all of this?  I thought they were a world church, not private investigators.  I need to know more before I start making decisions.
27260/0:I lost him!
27260/1:Maybe I scared him off.
27261/0:I lost him!
27262/0:I lost her!
27262/1:Maybe I scared her off.
27263/0:Get the hell out of here.  No payout, no refund, you're lucky we don't sell your butt to the Omar to recoup damages.
27264/0:I lost her!
27265/0:We needed to know everything.  Not just the biochemistry, but how you might use it.
27266/0:That hardly matters in the grand scheme of things.  You can try, but you're not going to be able to stop me from repurposing the Helios core for more beneficial purposes.
27267/0:Any special instructions for the drop?  Strafing run?  Hostile insertion?  Drop you near a pub?  You're payin' for quality, remember.
27268/0:Oh, you again.
27269/0:No, globally.  We're taking these summit preparations very seriously.  You and the other delegates will be able to conduct your business without any distractions.
27270/0:I guess the murderer fled.
27270/1:I got the job done, and chased off that bloodthirsty miscreant.
27271/0:That burglar got smart and left.
27271/1:I must have intimidated that foolish thief, because the area's clear now.
27272/0:Don't disappoint us like your classmate, Miss Sparks.  This was her mission, but she wouldn't follow through.  My captain on the ground took her into custody and will handle the transport out of the arcology.  Pay attention, Alex.  I'm through sweet-talking you trainees.  Do as we say or your traitorous friend dies.
27273/0:Well, she's out cold.  Happy now?
27274/0:I think I saw something...
27274/1:What's that?  It was a blur.
27275/0:I asked one guard if I could help -- you know, zap Archer with the stun prod a few more times -- but he wasn't too keen on that.
27276/0:Not so sneaky, are you?
27276/1:A-ha!
27277/0:That's a strange sound...
27277/1:I wonder what made that noise.
27278/0:I just felt something.
27278/1:What did I just bump into there?
27279/0:(grunt) What just hit me?!
27279/1:(grunt) Okay now you've got my attention...
27280/0:I'm Bud Puckett.  I live in Upper Seattle.  Call me sometime, maybe next time you're in town.  Okay?
27281/0:What is THAT?
27281/1:Whoa!
27282/0:Hmmm...  Foul play.
27282/1:Whoever's responsible can't have gotten far...
27283/0:Whoa.  Out cold.
27283/1:Still breathing...
27284/0:No thanks.
27285/0:I can take care of myself, but I might have use for a pilot later.  A long trip -- one way to New York City.
27286/0:The Age of Light is at hand.
27287/0:Guess it's my lucky night.  Gob-zilla gets cooked in her own cage -- now Snake-eyes goes four-to-one against some lap-lizard called the Claw.
27288/0:We were watching that facility ourselves.  Ever heard of an organization code-named ApostleCorp?
27289/0:Hey, back off.
27290/0:I hope you have a good time.
27291/0:More than you could handle, eh?
27291/1:You should've known you were no match for a member of the Order.
27292/0:More than you could handle, eh?
27292/1:You should've known you were no match for a member of the Order.
27293/0:
27294/0:Target's on the move.
27294/1:We've got a target taking flight.
27295/0:Target's on the move.
27295/1:We've got a target taking flight.
27296/0:Her Holiness was correct, in the beginning, to describe the problem as one of human growth.  Human growth was impeded in the old society.  "Almost all men carry out the purposes of other men, rather than their own, making them feel impotent in action."  Bertrand Russell.
27297/0:He's taking off!
27297/1:Look -- we must have scared him.
27298/0:JC is waiting.  Go.
27299/0:He's taking off!
27299/1:Look -- we must have scared him.
27300/0:She's taking off!
27300/1:Look -- we must have scared her.
27301/0:If you have official business, speak with Chief Morgan.
27302/0:She's taking off!
27302/1:Look -- we must have scared her.
27303/0:It is not clear.  It seems they are trying to learn more about us, but in gravely vicious ways. Right now, there is one of our number in captivity.  If you could help him reach this location, it would mean a great deal to us.
27304/0:I wouldn't worry about it.  Every client has a few quirks.  Anything else I can help you with?
27305/0:Wonder what happened to HIM...  
27305/1:...at least he's just unconscious.
27306/0:You arrive.  Good.  I am here to assist.
27307/0:Wonder what happened to HER...  
27307/1:...at least she's just unconscious.
27308/0:The killer must be nearby.
27308/1:I will remember your spirit in my meditations.
27309/0:Gotta find the culprit responsible for this attack.
27310/0:It's tricky getting in and out of this place unnoticed, but there ARE ways to stay inside and out of sight...  I have never been there myself, but I have heard some kids talk about a hideout somewhere in the ventilation system.  It seems no one on the faculty knows about it.
27311/0:My wife wants me to try to get a job in the arcology.  She doesn't understand that working there will only bring our family more materialism and chaos.
27312/0:You won't have died in vain, friend.
27312/1:I'll continue the Search in your name.
27313/0:Is that a unique detail?
27314/0:I'm not cleaning THAT up.
27314/1:Bleah.
27315/0:We should unfreeze him and say it's like the year 2525... just mess with his head.
27316/0:Whoa!  I wonder what got under it's skin...
27316/1:The animals sure are restless around here.
27317/0:
27318/0:Aww... poor thing.
27318/1:That's awful.
27319/0:Here you are -- you and Klara both -- our biggest secrets walking straight into a deployment of Templars.  Surely you've guessed -- You're the next generation of the technology MJ-12 used to create JC Denton.  You, Alex, are the third Denton prototype, a clone of JC.    
27320/0:What's wrong, kitty?
27321/0:Responding to the rioting in Trier, WTO Director Chad Dumier made a gesture of reconciliation today.
27322/0:The Nine Worlds is a no-weapons zone, strictly enforced since the riots.
27323/0:Why the necessity for an enclave, I am often asked.  Why a barrier between Upper and Lower Seattle?  Citizens, growth must be managed and contained, or we are the playthings of market forces.  Dumier economics provide a bulwark against these... struggles, these... unpredictable numbers... a bulwark against another Collapse.
27324/0:Have faith.  This must be part of some greater order we cannot yet see.  
27325/0:
27326/0:I'll take the multitools. [400]
27327/0:They really want us to find true balance and order in our lives, which can only be possible when we're not being subjected to secret experiments and agendas.  
27328/0:Not only do you need to work on your error-checking there in Cairo, but apparently you also need to learn to return video mail messages.  It's been SIX hours and I still haven't heard anything back about the design glitch I reported.  I demand an immediate response.
27329/0:You will need my assistance.
27330/0:Ha!  Missed me!
27330/1:Order protects me.
27331/0:Ha!  Missed me!
27331/1:Order protects me.
27332/0:Blasted mods...
27332/1:The target's modified.  Great.
27333/0:Blasted mods...
27333/1:The target's modified.  Great.
27334/0:Hey -- the target just went... invisible.
27335/0:Hey -- the target just went... invisible.
27336/0:
27337/0:Enemy's got that agg-def system.
27338/0:Enemy's got that agg-def system.
27339/0:Out of the eye?!  That's just nasty...
27340/0:Out of the eye?!  That's just nasty...
27341/0:Yikes.  I wonder what startled the rat.
27342/0:Eh?  The birds sure seem anxious.
27343/0:Some people build things up -- other people try to tear them down.
27344/0:Wish I had the buy-in money, but I don't.  [100 credits]
27345/0:Uh -- excuse me... This facility is for gold-team personnel only.  Stay right there while I check with security.
27346/0:Thank you.  I'd almost given up hope.  This morning I lost my daughter Mina to the plague.  I was here to claim the body when the Templars attacked.
27347/0:Sid Black.  How'd you end up in Trier?
27348/0:Stop doing this to me, Ani!  Oh!  (sobs)
27349/0:We've got it all under control.  Just go ahead and follow your orders.
27350/0:I'm a writer, in case you were wondering.  A novelist.  My job is to understand this rush of experience that sails past people around here -- and then fling it back in their faces.
27351/0:Of course Purity will prevail.  We are the righteous.
27352/0:Nice footwork, Flash. 
27353/0:Nice footwork, Flash. 
27354/0:I think the target's disrupting the mech's sensors. 
27355/0:I think the target's disrupting the mech's sensors.
27356/0:Got a casualty here.
27356/1:We're taking damage over here.
27357/0:Got a casualty here.
27357/1:We're taking damage over here.
27358/0:That monster hurt a Seeker!
27359/0:Maybe another time.
27360/0:That monster hurt a Seeker!
27361/0:No!  Arrrrgh!
27361/1:You will not have died in vain.
27362/0:No!  Arrrrgh!
27362/1:You will not have died in vain.
27363/0:What happened to the city's security forces?
27364/0:Listen.  Her Holiness is speaking.
27365/0:But how long until I'm threatened again?
27366/0:Very interesting.  I'll be sure that this info gets passed along to my superiors and that the Templars are punished for this violation.  It's a serious offense.  And here's a reward for your fact-finding.
27367/0:Who's the pyro?
27368/0:Looks like this area's seen action recently.
27369/0:Heard you've been playin' the Pit.  In a few minutes, they'll start the championship.
27370/0:As you know, after the Collapse, it was the WTO that started putting the pieces together, creating safe, clean, profitable enclaves, and opening up and regulating trade between them.  With this web of structures in place globally, we can offer an agent many opportunities in many locations.
27371/0:Does the phrase Total Information Awareness mean anything to you?  Never mind.  Here's the money.
27372/0:Someone's fired a crossbow here.  And missed.
27373/0:Nah, it's just another part of the city-wide lockdown, along with the curfews, to try to regain control after the riots broke out at Panzerwerks.
27374/0:If it wasn't for the Order, I would have nothing... Nothing!
27375/0:My orders are to secure the lower level.
27376/0:Good.  Now I'd like you to come downstairs to meet the other trainees.  Billie Adams you know from Chicago.  Check in with her in Apartment 454 on your way down.
27377/0:Need medical assistance?  Experts recommend bots over human physicians three-to-one.
27377/1:Public medical terminal.  Diagnostic corpus updated daily.
27377/2:In your time of need, consider Piezochem medbot.  Piezochem: there for life.
27378/0:New patients welcome.
27378/1:Greetings.
27379/0:Wonder what happened to HIM...  
27379/1:...at least he's just unconscious.
27380/0:You'll be safe in the rec area.  GO, Alex.  I don't have time to debrief every one of the trainees.
27381/0:Wonder what happened to HIM...  
27381/1:...at least he's just unconscious.
27382/0:We will avenge your death!
27383/0:Wonder what happened to HER...  
27383/1:...at least she's just unconscious.
27384/0:Someone is reading too much into Chairman Dumier's concern for your leader.  He was simply being a good statesman by authorizing a rescue attempt.
27385/0:We will avenge your death!
27386/0:Wonder what happened to HER...  
27386/1:...at least she's just unconscious.
27387/0:You see these radicals in the news -- they want a Crusade against the rest of us.
27388/0:That thing killed one of our soldiers!
27389/0:The killer must be nearby.
27389/1:May your spirit now find true Order.
27390/0:That thing killed one of our soldiers!
27391/0:The killer must be nearby.
27391/1:May your spirit now find true Order.
27392/0:The Templars have been airlifting troops into the arcology.  This is a foreign invasion, pure and simple.
27393/0:Yeah, just like I taught you.
27393/1:That, my friend, is how it is done.
27394/0:Let's just say I'm a fan of QueeQueg's coffee.
27395/0:Yeah, just like I taught you.
27395/1:That, my friend, is how it is done.
27396/0:Now you've got groups like The Order who are making more trouble every day BECAUSE of the WTO, especially their more extreme members.
27397/0:But -- how?  I've heard that Miss Withers is a leech.  She won't do an endorsement unless there's something in it for herself.
27398/0:Our willingness to negotiate is met with violence.  This only underscores that the time for talking has passed.
27399/0:It was just a matter of time.
27399/1:No match for the Order.
27400/0:My staff is skeptical, but I assure you -- my counter-nanite will work!
27401/0:It was just a matter of time.
27401/1:No match for the Order.
27402/0:Hey!  Coward!
27402/1:How can you desert your brethren like this?
27403/0:Hey!  Coward!
27403/1:How can you desert your brethren like this?
27404/0:I wonder where this knife came from.
27405/0:We will try to help you as you helped us.
27406/0:I don't think that just moved on it's own...
27406/1:Is someone there, moving things around?
27407/0:It's safe to leave this platform now.  The spill's been cleaned up.
27408/0:Where did it go?
27408/1:Did it just get up and walk off on its own?
27409/0:Here.  Take Chen's present.
27410/0:Hmm... That's not where it's supposed to be.
27410/1:I wonder how that got there.
27411/0:They're up to something...  and if it was in our best interest we wouldn't be kept in the dark about it.
27412/0:That can't be good for it.
27412/1:Yikes.  That's wrecked.
27413/0:I wonder how THAT happened.
27413/1:Yikes.  What a mess.
27414/0:This shouldn't be shut down.
27414/1:Hope the repair bot tends to that soon.
27415/0:(laugh)  Nice.
27416/0:I have good days and bad days.
27417/0:That's not what it's designed for.
27417/1:I think it's malfunctioning.
27418/0:I guess this room might have a ceiling vent or something, but that won't do ME any good.  I'm claustrophobic.  If you've got a multitool, you might try hacking the control panel next to the beams.  Or disable it with an EMP weapon.  Or -- or something else that might work -- just blow the whole thing up with a grenade.
27419/0:QueeQueg's is all about the bean.  You can't have a good cup of coffee without a good bean.
27420/0:You have my compliments.  I heard through the grapevine that you gave the WTO a tip that led to the assassination of the cyborg.  That'll buy me a month or two until the Omar sneak another one into town.
27421/0:By the way, Miss Klara Sparks is now dead.
27422/0:Someone overpowered a Seeker...?  
27422/1:Looks like we've got an enemy in the area, knocking out our troops.
27423/0:Someone overpowered a Seeker...?  
27423/1:Looks like we've got an enemy in the area, knocking out our troops.
27424/0:You won't have died in vain, friend.
27424/1:May your spirit find true Order.
27425/0:Okay.
27426/0:You won't have died in vain, friend.
27426/1:May your spirit find true Order.
27427/0:The vent shaft... good idea.  You might be able to avoid the creatures altogether.
27428/0:Clearly no match for a Seeker.
27428/1:Soon, another Order victory.
27429/0:Ick.  What a mess.
27429/1:I'm not cleaning THAT up.
27430/0:Clearly no match for a Seeker.
27430/1:Soon, another Order victory.
27431/0:Ick.  What a mess.
27431/1:I'm not cleaning THAT up.
27432/0:
27433/0:We're making quick work of this one.
27434/0:Whoa!  I wonder what got under it's skin...
27434/1:The animals sure are restless around here.
27435/0:We're making quick work of this one.
27436/0:Whoa!  I wonder what got under it's skin...
27436/1:The animals sure are restless around here.
27437/0:When will they learn, eh?
27438/0:Aww... poor thing.
27438/1:That's awful.
27439/0:I have five pilots, and you aren't any of them.  This is just PERFECT.
27440/0:When will they learn, eh?
27441/0:Aww... poor thing.
27441/1:That's awful.
27442/0:Here.
27443/0:He's done for.
27444/0:I don't understand...
27445/0:He's done for.
27446/0:She's done for.
27447/0:
27447/1:
27447/2:
27447/3:
27447/4:
27448/0:
27449/0:She's done for.
27450/0:My foster parents enrolled me at a Tarsus middle school.  I never thought about it much.
27451/0:Give me the black market biomods. [850]
27452/0:They have put us here with a badness in mind.
27453/0:Not interested, honey.
27454/0:What exactly are you suggesting?
27455/0:No solicitors.  Violators will be prosecuted and/or shot.
27456/0:Huh.  Better look again.
27456/1:That didn't look right.
27457/0:The chances of you finding a bug in a globally distributed AI construct are ten billion to one.
27458/0:During the Collapse, JC had little choice other than exile.  The merger with the Helios AI was unstable.  He needed a safe place to retire while we developed a more compatible biomod architecture.
27459/0:Wake your ass up -- I saw something.
27460/0:Don't like the sound of THAT...
27460/1:... hearin' somethin'...
27461/0:Hey -- listen.
27462/0:Whah!  What's that?
27463/0:Sure, take out Dumier's commandos on the dock.  [1000]
27464/0:I tried to work up a system for the commodities market, but it turns out my talent's more for general trends than specifics.
27465/0:I met him in Paris once, a long time ago.  He helped me against MJ-12.
27466/0:What's wrong, kitty?
27467/0:What's wrong, kitty?
27468/0:Yikes.  I wonder what startled the rat.
27469/0:Yikes.  I wonder what startled the rat.
27470/0:The tide's about to turn.  I can feel it.
27470/1:Her Holiness, guide me to victory...
27471/0:Eh?  The birds sure seem anxious.
27472/0:The tide's about to turn.  I can feel it.
27472/1:Her Holiness, guide me to victory...
27473/0:Eh?  The birds sure seem anxious.
27474/0:I wouldn't stick my neck out if I was you.  These are powerful people.
27475/0:Focus!  Take care of him already!
27476/0:Looks like this bot has seen action recently.
27476/1:Seems like the repair bots should've fixed this up already...
27477/0:Focus!  Take care of him already!
27478/0:Looks like this bot has seen action recently.
27478/1:Seems like the repair bots should've fixed this up already...
27479/0:Out, demons, out!  Out, demons, out!
27480/0:Focus!  Take care of her already!
27481/0:Focus!  Take care of her already!
27482/0:
27483/0:(scream)
27483/1:This can't be happening!
27484/0:(scream)
27484/1:This can't be happening!
27485/0:Seattle and the WTO -- an exciting past and a glorious future.  Be proud, Seattle.  You are an example to the world.
27486/0:Oh no!  He just won't quit!
27487/0:Oh no!  He just won't quit!
27488/0:(grunt) ... gob-eatin' thug...
27488/1:(grunt) Come out and stand up to this!
27489/0:My orders encompass that contingency as well.
27490/0:(grunt) Scab's lightin' my ass UP!
27491/0:What the --
27492/0:Hey... Hey!  What's THAT?  // calling to an ally
27493/0:Oooo, tricky...
27494/0:Scab's tryin' to fake us out.
27495/0:Alex, no luck finding an exit.  Why are we locked in?  And why aren't the other trainees asking questions?  Maybe they're in on it... whatever IT is.  I don't like this, Alex.  They whisk us out of bed, bring us here in the middle of the night, and... Hold on.  I hear someone.  Come see me as soon as you get this.
27496/0:Hm, somebody scare it?
27497/0:Great.  The stench'll draw gobs from a mile away.
27498/0:Area returning to normal.
27499/0:A dead cat.  There's a mean son-of-a-bitch around here somewhere.
27500/0:Another dead bird.
27501/0:Sources tell us that a formal acceptance speech from Her Holiness is imminent.
27502/0:If you want to keep your state-of-the-art development facility, you'll continue developing these "toys" for the rich.
27503/0:A bot down?  I wonder what's going on...
27503/1:I don't think this bot should be offline.
27504/0:A bot down?  I wonder what's going on...
27504/1:I don't think this bot should be offline.
27505/0:You don't see a bot acting like that everyday.
27505/1:Don't try to tell me that's a new bot feature...
27506/0:You don't see a bot acting like that everyday.
27506/1:Don't try to tell me that's a new bot feature...
27507/0:Oh no!  She just won't quit!
27508/0:That door shouldn't be open. 
27509/0:Ready for an extraction, sweets.  Just send word with the pilot beacon by Flight Bay 23.
27510/0:Oh no!  She just won't quit!
27511/0:That door shouldn't be open. 
27512/0:We're all going to die!
27512/1:We're falling apart!
27513/0:Hmmm... Door's closed.
27514/0:Gain access to the arcology.  I will do the same.
27515/0:We're all going to die!
27515/1:We're falling apart!
27516/0:Hmmm... Door's closed.
27517/0:Why can't people just leave the lights alone? (sigh)
27518/0:Why can't people just leave the lights alone? (sigh)
27519/0:We are improving our services for biomodified customers.
27520/0:Shall we conduct business?
27521/0:Trying to keep it safe around here.
27522/0:Oh really?  More fun for us.
27523/0:He didn't even have a chance.  He was just standing there...
27524/0:I'm ready to make a run for it.  The infested air in the medina would be better than waiting for our doom here.
27525/0:You mean...?
27526/0:Help us strengthen our control.
27527/0:What's it mean for us?
27528/0:I heard you talking about Dr. Nassif.
27529/0:The city's under martial law, but the attacks on Seekers continue.
27530/0:You'll be fine.  Just be ready to go the instant I give the word.
27531/0:Right!  Knights!  That's rich.... Beat up a few defenseless bystanders, and suddenly you're --
27532/0:Who shut off the light?
27533/0:Who shut off the light?
27534/0:That looked funny.
27534/1:Hey!  Someone there?  Thought I wasn't lookin', huh?
27535/0:Either I saw somebody or I don't know what.
27536/0:Don't like the sound of THAT...
27536/1:... hearin' somethin'...
27537/0:I'll let you know if I learn anything.
27538/0:Hear that?  Wasn't no cleaner-bot.
27539/0:Whah!  What's that?
27540/0:(grunt) Come out and stand up to this!
27540/1:(grunt) What the -- !
27541/0:(grunt) Hey, you see the scab?  Cuz I can't.
27542/0:So they let the Chicago transfers out of their cages.  You're looking at Leo Jankowski.  You train here now, so I guess you can call me Leo.
27543/0:The Omar.  Hmph.  They show up out of nowhere.  Now they are in a hurry to turn into something even stranger.
27544/0:Man...  // solemn
27545/0:Are you sure we can trust JC?  Even after the merger and Antarctica?  Have you looked around?  All he's done -- I have to wonder about his sanity.
27546/0:I hope this is not some weird test of my concentration...
27547/0:Thanks.
27548/0:I've got more important things to do with my time than gossip.
27549/0:By the way, we let Miss Sparks go.  Chief Morgan has taken her out of the arcology.  I'm glad that we can trust each other, Alex.
27550/0:Talk to Red.  He's the friendly one.
27551/0:Protesters claimed that the vote had been somehow fixed and that the results did not reflect the will of the people, particularly those living outside the enclave.
27552/0:I have to guard the apartment, or I'd go to Club Vox myself.
27553/0:Thanks.  What are you going to do?
27554/0:They don't like me talking to the customers too much.
27555/0:Bud!  It's been three days.  How was your date?
27556/0:Upon consideration, you'll see that this arrangement is for the best.  "General ideas are no proof of the strength, but rather of the insufficiency of the human intellect."  The words of Alexis de Tocqueville, an observer of the birth of modern democracy.  Though general ideas allow human minds to make judgments quickly, they are necessarily incomplete.
27557/0:Hey... Hey!  What's THAT?  // calling to an ally
27558/0:And you think you can equalize human ability with biomods?
27559/0:Think I'm some kinda simp?  Huh?
27560/0:It's horrible... you go out there to do something for your family and you're willing to work, no matter how hard, whatever it takes to get into a walled enclave.  But you're worthless.  That's what they teach you.  You're not even worth five minutes of their time.
27561/0:Scab's tryin' to fake us out.
27562/0:
27563/0:Too much smoke...
27564/0:Hm -- that wasn't what it sounded like.
27565/0:Huh?
27565/1:Eh?
27565/2:Oh?
27566/0:Someone's tryin' to throw us off...
27567/0:Go.  History is waiting to be made.
27568/0:Scabby pests...  Now what?
27569/0:It's dead.  Wonder why the filthy scab didn't eat it.
27570/0:Billie, what are you talking about?  Do you know something?
27571/0:Hm.  That wasn't open.
27572/0:Hm.  That wasn't closed.
27573/0:Pequod's Coffee, Arcology Level 107 -- on the edge.
27574/0:You're the best, Alex.  Don't worry -- I'll think of something.
27575/0:It is time for vitakka, applied thinking.  Taking what we desire and reconciling it with what we know.  Vitakka.  Study your meditations.  Nothing pleases the balanced mind more than to bring its good work into the world.
27576/0:The Order opened my eyes and saved me from the wicked consumerism that was unbalancing my life.
27577/0:How can you be so sure?
27578/0:The REAL opposition right now comes from the Templars, the militant anti-biomodification group.  The summit was only a cover to justify our public presence in Trier.  Our true goal was to investigate rumors of a Templar splinter cell within the Order. 
27579/0:Be prepared for delays.
27580/0:If anything happens to my daughter, you're going to pay.  I mean it.
27581/0:Enough talking.  I have much to think about.
27582/0:You don't sound worried.
27583/0:I found out that the missing Tarsus children were just playing a prank.
27584/0:My seekers, from today you are all missionaries.  Chairman Dumier welcomes your teaching in the WTO enclaves.  Just as Rome, once touched, fell to the spell of Christianity, so too will the city-states of our time accept order, respect, and balance.
27585/0:That repair bot better show up.
27586/0:Let's see what this drone can do...
27587/0:Stick around and we're gonna be gob-meat.
27587/1:Ain't worth it.
27587/2:Scatter!  Go!  Go!  Go!
27588/0:Quit bunchin' up!
27588/1:Get over there!  Now!
27588/2:Cut the scab off!
27589/0:Surround him!
27590/0:You wouldn't believe me.
27591/0:Thought that was off.
27592/0:Surround her!
27593/0:If he wants to peddle his overpriced Pequachinos down here, let him.  But I deserve a shot at those baby-faced executives uptown.  What I need is a hacker, someone to break into the Civic Manager's computer at the WTO terminal and approve my zoning petition.  Business is good down here.  I've got money, and I want to expand.
27594/0:Thought that was on.
27595/0:With me?  Come on, just a little closer.
27595/1:A little more....  Don't freeze up on me now...
27595/2:Just stick together and keep moving.
27596/0:All busted up.  Man.
27597/0:Ready... jump!
27597/1:Now, my killers.  Now!
27597/2:Go in!  Go in!
27598/0:Looks broke...
27599/0:Let's hope he has a sense of humor.
27600/0:Scabland bums... always stealin' something.
27601/0:These kids probably have no idea how good they've got it.
27602/0:Wow.  Guess THAT'S out of order
27603/0:Guess it's down for some reason...
27604/0:Where'd THAT come from?
27605/0:So ApostleCorp has some sort of home base in Cairo.  I guess we know where you're going to find your next target.  Your pilot will be waiting for you on the roof.
27606/0:We've been with the program since we were thirteen years old.  Why are you so quick to abandon that?  What can the Order offer you?
27607/0:That ain't for decoration, I bet.
27608/0:Someone cut the lights...
27609/0:We will transact again.
27610/0:Whatever you say.
27611/0:Billie... a Templar...?  Wow, am I the only one without a secret alliance?
27612/0:At least greasels have some personality.
27613/0:Huh?
27613/1:Eh?
27613/2:Oh?
27614/0:You saved our necks.  Now she can't fire us or force us to go in there.
27615/0:I guess I took a wrong turn somewhere.
27616/0:Awaiting payment...
27617/0:Lemme splatter this scab...
27618/0:Free this one.
27619/0:A helicopter followed you here.  Tracer Tong sent it to pick me up from Area 51 after my infiltration of MJ-12.  Ava Johnson was the pilot, an AI construct.  I'm putting her at your disposal.  Go back to the surface and activate the pilot beacon at the abandoned VersaLife base so that she will know where to land.
27620/0:
27621/0:It's live!   // panic
27621/1:Stingball!
27622/0:Thanks for the tip.
27623/0:He's tryin' to bomb us!
27624/0:She's tryin' to bomb us!
27625/0:Damn, almost got my face blown off.  Bet it's on a motion-trigger.
27625/1:Better stay clear -- it might blow...
27626/0:Pitch black... oooo, scary.  Who's hiding in here?
27627/0:
27627/1:
27627/2:
27627/3:
27627/4:
27628/0:Lost the scab.
27628/1:Soon as I find you?  You're dead.
27628/2:Must be hiding...
27629/0:I don't remember it being this dark out here.
27630/0:Guess he got shook and hid.
27631/0:Why's this light on...?
27632/0:Guess she got shook and hid.
27633/0:Mama shoulda taught the scab to close the door...
27634/0:Don't worry.  We always find our rat...
27635/0:Glad I could help.
27636/0:I thought this door was open.
27637/0:Damn!  We almost had the scab.
27638/0:Ooo, classy job.  Whoever it is ain't afraid of gettin' caught.
27639/0:Hey!  Who started the fire?
27640/0:I was called in to help with this Templar debacle... for all the good it did the SSC.
27641/0:Hm, smoke...
27642/0:Hm, blood.
27643/0:Then who is in the apartment upstairs?  Not you?  A neighbor told me she saw Templars, and I received a threatening vmail from a man I used to know like a brother -- now he parades down the street in his robe, goes with a mob into the arcology, and threatens my life!
27644/0:If I can turn public opinion against the Order and WTO, then the Illuminati will have nothing.
27645/0:Yo!  Who's blocking the light?
27646/0:You know I can't.
27647/0:I'm sure that Max was at Panzerwerks when the riot started.  He's never late for work.
27648/0:How can you be so sure?
27649/0:Look out!
27650/0:When you drink a cup of coffee, you drink Pequod's, because Pequod's is a pioneer of the new economy: efficient, modern, clean...
27651/0:Wish I could afford the silencer.  [300]
27652/0:Good work.  Chief Morgan will be pleased.
27653/0:Keep the peek -- he ain't dead yet.
27654/0:Keep the peek -- she ain't dead yet.
27655/0:The important thing is to rebuild.  Then we can stop fixating on the Collapse and get back to normal lives.
27656/0:Think you can run?  I won't let you!
27656/1:Smart move.  Get out while you can.
27657/0:See?  You can't scrip' it in a straight fight.
27657/1:Didn't mean to scare ya off...
27658/0:That way!
27659/0:So you're Mr. Kurczec.  I met your partner, Mr. O'Rourke, in Seattle.
27660/0:Whoa!
27660/1:Oooo.  I'm shakin'.
27660/2:That's right.  You're missin'.  Scared or somethin'?
27661/0:Yuck.  Another dead gob.
27662/0:Ha-ha!  Look at me!
27663/0:I'm sorry.  That's what he said.
27664/0:Somebody's packin'...
27665/0:Huh.  Scab's all bark.
27666/0:Must've been a pretty big gun to do THAT.
27667/0:Brother can't fight.
27668/0:Bulletholes... (laugh) Ain't gonna be no bulletholes in me -- I know that much.
27669/0:Girl can't fight.
27670/0:A caster bolt?  Hm.
27671/0:That knife's for fightin'...
27672/0:After the decimation of Chicago, the obscure motives of Her Holiness and the Order are only part of what worries security experts.  Go under the veil of the Order and you find that perhaps Disorder is a better word for this so-called unified world faith.
27673/0:Hm, bot got roasted.
27674/0:But I also have access to better-quality protection, thanks to mercenaries like you.
27675/0:Looks like bad news.
27676/0:You sound sincere.  I will discuss the matter with the captain.
27677/0:Splendid.  An opportunity for my new friend to meet the enemy.
27678/0:Security must be pretty nonexistent around here.  Is there a lot of crime?
27679/0:A co-dominion with the WTO?  Not in my lifetime.
27680/0:Just visiting New Seattle.
27681/0:Trier residents will be getting a new cup-o-Joe next month.  Pequod's has announced plans to open a branch in the downtown district.  The manager of the local Queequeg's has been curiously silent on the issue.
27682/0:
27682/1:
27682/2:
27682/3:
27682/4:
27682/5:
27682/6:
27682/7:
27683/0:Some people in the medina think these are just for show, but I KNOW.  I work here.  The counter-agent gets encoded at that computer terminal over there.
27684/0:How does the Church and Mr. Dumier plan to deal with New Cairo?  There won't be any enclave citizens to convert if the Templars get their way.
27685/0:Must be some sort of biomod.
27685/1:How'd you do THAT?
27686/0:Enough talk.  You've put us in danger by coming here.
27687/0:Tell me about this epidemic.
27688/0:Camoflage, huh?  Think I'm scared?  Think again.  Ain't exactly fair, though.
27689/0:Huh?  Was that a laser?
27690/0:Looks mean, but I bet it's pretty low-caliber...
27691/0:So -- think you're too fast for me...
27692/0:I've learned a lot since leaving Chicago...
27693/0:Still breathing... Hm.
27694/0:Dude can move!
27695/0:Poor fool.
27696/0:Chick can move!
27697/0:Someone knocked out one of my pack...  Didn't have the guts to finish the job, I guess.
27698/0:Must be some kinda field for confusing sensors...
27699/0:At least the brother's still alive...
27700/0:(grunt)
27700/1:(grunt) That all you got?
27700/2:(grunt) Scab got lucky.
27701/0:At least the sister's still alive...
27702/0:(grunt) I've taken worse than THAT.  Know how to GIVE it, too...
27703/0:Grand Master Saman doesn't have infinite patience.  It's time for you to get to work.
27704/0:Ain't how it's s'posed to get scrip'ed, huh-uh.
27704/1:Real bright, scab.  Where are ya?
27705/0:Brother's gone.  Nothin' we can do for him.
27706/0:No problem.  I'm gonna have to get used to the idea sooner or later.
27707/0:Sister's gone.  Nothin' we can do for her.
27708/0:The REAL opposition right now comes from the Templars, the militant anti-biomodification group.  The summit was only a cover to justify our public presence in Trier.  Our true goal was to investigate rumors of a Templar splinter cell within the Order. 
27709/0:We must return the safeness to this area.
27710/0:Nickel and dime, nickel and dime...
27711/0:I've completed my mission.
27712/0:You know, what's really going on...
27713/0:When you drink a cup of coffee, you drink Pequod's, because Pequod's is a pioneer of the new economy: efficient, modern, clean...
27714/0:We welcome parents' visits, but it IS the middle of the school day right now.
27715/0:
27716/0:Sorry.  I had some business to take care of in Trier.
27717/0:Not much is open in this neighborhood this late.
27718/0:Time limit reached.  Deposit more credits.
27719/0:Live it up.  Someone from SSC will be running you off shortly.
27720/0:Ow!
27721/0:(grunt) Get in this!  Come on!
27722/0:I just want my job back.
27723/0:(grunt) (growl) // angry
27723/1:(grunt) ... turning into a real fight...
27724/0:(grunt) I'm hurtin' pretty bad.
27725/0:I don't even have to worry about this weird weather when I'm wearing this thing.
27726/0:Nothing to be concerned about.  You have your assignment, Alex.
27727/0:(groan)
27727/1:(groan) No!
27728/0:So it wasn't an accidental spill?
27729/0:(groan) Forget me.  I'm just about ghost.
27730/0:Aaagh!  Some kind of poison!
27731/0:I'm not much of an NG fan, but I will do whatever it takes to sell more QueeQuachinos.
27732/0:Nothing you can give me will help Paul now.  I've joined the Illuminati cause and Paul is dead.
27733/0:(scream)
27733/1:(scream)  I'm cooked!
27734/0:... got me in the eyes!
27735/0:I can handle my own affairs.
27736/0:Ha!  Look at me!  Dancin' like a fool greasel!
27736/1:Lucky I know how to take a hit.
27737/0:That's the machine talking, the machine that runs your cells and rules your heart.
27738/0:Go.  Before more seekers arrive.
27739/0:Versalife long quiet.  Their base is nearby.
27740/0:Just like her to flaunt her position...
27741/0:No society is without this conflict.  Our intention is to develop both principles and then integrate them into an open, secular society.
27742/0:Get out of here!
27743/0:Go to hell.
27744/0:I'll have more influence on the WTO from inside the ranks.
27745/0:You're a fool.  All JC's machine requires is your brain's neural tissue.  If you are unwilling, I will have to bring your head to him myself.
27746/0:
27747/0:By the way, we let Miss Sparks go.  Our people took her out of the arcology.  I'm glad that we can trust each other, Alex.
27748/0:(grunt) 
27748/1:(howl) 
27749/0:Then what are you going to do?
27750/0:(grunt) I'm cooked... (gurgle)
27751/0:(gasp)
27752/0:Gettin' in my game...
27752/1:Try an' scrip' a hit, forgettin' it -- I'm too quick.
27753/0:Lemme show you feebs how it's done.
27754/0:A grave mistake, then.  Their children are waking up.  You, too.  You don't want to live in an engineered society, whether it's stratified like a Masonic pyramid or subsumed by the Denton-Helios panopticon.
27755/0:Hurt me, baby!
27756/0:Let's see what you got, bro'.
27757/0:Yeah.  Yeah, I can do this.  // thinking hard
27757/1:This is gettin' serious.
27758/0:Wake up down there!  Come on!
27759/0:Ain't no random feeb...
27760/0:Time to PROVE.  Know what I'm sayin'?
27761/0:That was a practical joke.
27762/0:Take care of your business, then find me at Pequod's Coffee on 107.  We'll negotiate a fee for the next hop.
27763/0:
27764/0:All I know is I've never seen weather like THIS before.
27765/0:
27766/0:Right, Morgan told me to expect you, Alex.  She said you might want some help, especially since we suspect the Order may be plotting to assassinate Nassif.  My orders are to protect Nassif, no matter what.  We need her alive AND conscious for quick information extraction.
27767/0:We explained that our research would eventually permit us to offer the same opportunities for biomodification to everyone.  She had a responsibility to the world to help advance this venerable cause.  Plus she was generously compensated for the necessary risks and sacrifices. 
27768/0:
27769/0:Great work.  Both shoppers have made it to safety.
27770/0:You!  Who sent you?
27771/0:
27771/1:
27771/2:
27771/3:
27771/4:
27772/0:Trying to brainwash more mercenaries?
27773/0:What the hell are you doing?!  They're just children!  
27774/0:Guess it's my lucky night.  Gob-zilla gets cooked in her own cage -- now Snake-eyes is the new Champ!  It's been a long time comin', lemme tell ya.

27777/3:
27778/0:Trouble in the Inclinator.  Some sort of spill.
27779/0:I've seen the NG commercial, the endorsement of Pequod's.  Thanks a million.
27780/0:It's a hard time for the Church, but this is when Her Holiness would have needed your support.  She died during the rescue attempt, which means that there might be a crisis in faith unless you, as the High Augur, can reassure the believers.
27781/0:Tough break about Chicago.  I think everyone'll understand if you want to take it easy these first few days.
27782/0:Uh-oh.  Now I did it.
27782/1:That's just fear talkin'.  I gotta stay in this...
27783/0:Stop!  Don't kill me!
27784/0:I wonder what the WTO's gonna say.  Companies have to get their garbage out of Upper Seattle SOMEHOW.
27785/0:We're cooked!
27785/1:Gonna be scab graves for all of us if we don't DO somethin'!
27786/0:This was a historic day.
27787/0:How we gonna stop him?  // panic
27788/0:How we gonna stop her?  // panic
27789/0:I'll go in close with the shotgun.
27790/0:Groovy.
27790/1:Ba-boom!
27790/2:Juice!
27790/3:BOOM!
27790/4:Oh, yeah, I'm GOOD...
27791/0:Like juicin' gobs in a gutter...
27791/1:(laugh) Got you scrip'ed now...
27792/0:Right, but you've been working for both the WTO and Order, so the jury's still out on whether I can even trust you.  I will warn you that I suspect the Order may want Nassif dead, but the WTO doesn't believe in vigilantism and I plan to enforce the law, no matter who threatens Nassif or why.  We need her alive AND conscious for quick information extraction.
27793/0:My show, staring me, myself, and I...
27794/0:I am not sure, but I think we are in real danger.
27795/0:Ha-ha-ha!!!  Scared?
27796/0:Can't scrip' it up close, huh?
27796/1:Do or die, scab.
27797/0:And they called it Aquinas.  That's about all I need to know.
27798/0:This is a crime scene.  Please leave.
27799/0:I looked around the school.  Listen, there's no other way to say this -- your daughter's dead.
27800/0:Hey!  Pit's off-limits!
27801/0:I am serious.  Take a weapon mod.
27802/0:We have gathered the data we need.  Soon we will be able to halt modification entirely.
27803/0:Uh... dumpster diving?
27804/0:Everyone loses their way at some point -- we just want to help people find the way back.
27805/0:The Director must've found someone to clean up the mess.
27806/0:I'm getting groomed for my dad's job.  He handles the entire continent of Africa.
27807/0:There's fifty-two cetasikas, according to the Order Church.  Fifty-two aspects of the mind.  That's a lot of knots to untangle.
27808/0:Human consciousness is not ready for what JC and Paul intend.
27809/0:
27810/0:What if I wanted to take a look at the prototype?
27811/0:Clearly we were all very wrong about you, Alex.
27812/0:Then ApostleCorp has already lost everything.  Rescue Her Holiness.  Save the Summit for the sake of both factions.  They will help you against the Templars.  You will need the help of the WTO and Order just a little while longer...
27813/0:Ever since the Collapse, the whole world's a Pit, except instead of gobs it's cults.  WTO, Order, Omar, Templars -- they're all the same.
27814/0:Oooooo, yeah...
27814/1:I saw, I said, I did.
27814/2:Too bad.
27814/3:Guess that means I win...
27815/0:Ain't no one stands up to ME.
27815/1:Feeb meat.
27815/2:Hey, yo, somethin' wrong?  You not feelin' well?  (chuckle)  What you need?  A glass of water?  Come on, get up.  You look like a damn wino.
27816/0:Big mistake.  I grew up on the outs, man.  Been fightin' since before I remember.
27817/0:Big mistake.  I grew up on the outs, lady.  Been fightin' since before I remember.
27818/0:It took countless hours of negotiations, but we were able to come to an agreement that benefits both organizations' individual members worldwide.  
27819/0:Huh... foxy lady... out slumming, I guess.
27820/0:Huh... pretty boy... out slumming, I guess.
27821/0:We are about to see the rebirth of global civilization.  What form it takes will shape human history for centuries.
27822/0:That's what I'm talkin' about.  Scrip' it once and scrip' it hard.
27822/1:Check it out.
27822/2:Look -- scab's eyes are still movin'!
27823/0:That's what we're all told when we join -- what you would've been told, eventually, if your training hadn't been interrupted.  It sounds better than the constant bickering and war-mongering between the Order, the WTO, the Templars... all the quasi-Feudal powers that sprang up after the Collapse.
27824/0:We got the scab.
27825/0:Got him.
27826/0:So?
27827/0:Got her.
27828/0:On a stage near the Pequod's coffeeshop.  That'll be SO COOL if you come!  Tickets are 200 credits at the door.
27829/0:The separation of powers -- from Aristotle to Montesquieu -- is designed purely to thwart the ambitions of individuals.  How comical, the West's pride in its vast tangle of agencies, jurisdictions, arcane procedures...
27830/0:I think I changed my mind about that other code.
27831/0:Take care, Alex.  The Program will endure as long as one of you survives.
27832/0:I took care of that lawyer, Kevin O'Rourke.  He won't be bothering your customers anymore.
27833/0:More hours.
27834/0:Mr. O'Rourke wishes to be alone now.
27835/0:I tried to get answers out of Dr. Nassif, but all she'd give me is the elevator code.  It's 28901, if you need it.  I don't know what's going on, but it's clear we're not safe.  We don't know anyone here, so we'd better watch each other's back.
27836/0:This is a Code Yellow health advisory.
27837/0:Perhaps.  If you'd like free transportation, I'll be waiting at the landing pad outside the arcology.
27838/0:He said he'd meet you at your penthouse in an hour.  He seemed disappointed that I'm not your new chamber-boy.
27839/0:I'm ready.
27840/0:No....!  NO!  The Omar are destroying the Helios core!  Satisfied, Alex?  I'm mortal like you again.  Helios won't be able to save me this time, but I don't plan to be the one who needs saving.  You want to plunge the world into chaos...?  Come and take it from me.  I have reclaimed the Statue of Liberty for all of humanity.
27841/0:Gob don't scare ME.
27842/0:See ya later, alligator.
27843/0:Need a lift?  [500 credits.]
27844/0:Just a pup.
27845/0:Sack of slime...
27846/0:Oh yeah?  Oh yeah...?
27846/1:What-ever, how-ever -- I'm ready.
27846/2:Time to make some juice...
27847/0:(bleeps) Diagnostics passed.
27847/1:(bleeps) Culling bad cells (bleeps).... Done.
27847/2:(bleeps) Checking CAM unit... Done.
27847/3:(bleeps) Fuel cells charged.
27847/4:(bleeps) Proceeding with current directive.
27847/5:(bleeps) Posting status.
27847/6:(bleeps) Communication received.
27847/7:(bleeps) Power glitch... fixed.
27848/0:Think you can scrip' it against ME?
27848/1:I ain't no feeb.
27849/0:I drink what I like.  I don't try to make some sort of political statement with it.
27850/0:(bleeps)
27850/1:(bleeps)
27850/2:(yawn)
27850/3:(clears throat)
27850/4:(electric buzzing)
27850/5:(sparks crackle)
27850/6:(error bleeps)
27851/0:I'm scrippin'... Ain't slippin' -- nuh-uh -- Ain't trippin' -- just scrippin' this gutter-gob.
27852/0:What about you -- here to eliminate more of my men?  The Templars have given it a good start.  I was called in to help with this debacle... for all the good it did the SSC. 
27853/0:Go back to your apartment.  You'll be able to get to the biomod lab through a breach the Order made in the residential area.
27854/0:Guy must be some kinda feeb to attack US.
27855/0:I suggest you manage your behavior wisely.
27855/1:None of that activity, please.
27856/0:Girl must be some kinda feeb to attack US.
27857/0:Be careful... the wiring.
27857/1:Warning: high subcutaneous voltage.
27857/2:All of my equipment is cybernetic and impossible to steal.
27858/0:Ain't lost my touch.
27858/1:Not then, not now, not ever!
27859/0:But -- armed guards in a nightclub?
27860/0:You cannot learn anything about my systems from visual analysis.
27860/1:Is there a problem?  Why are you staring?
27860/2:See something unusual?
27861/0:What are you doing?
27861/1:I am wondering what your intention might be.
27861/2:Behavior heuristic abnormal.   Require reassurance.
27862/0:You don't see that too often in a championship.  A draw.  Here's your money back.
27863/0:Please -- I know too much already, and my living situation in Lower Seattle is not secure.
27864/0:Restricted area.  Please leave.
27864/1:Go back.  Now.
27864/2:You will respect the privacy of the Omar.
27865/0:Hostility noted.
27865/1:Force will be answered with force.
27865/2:Assault me and you will learn about polyaniline-augmented reflexes.
27866/0:I will assume that was an accident.
27866/1:Do not make that mistake again.
27867/0:This is your second warning.
27867/1:Please modify your behavior.
27868/0:Hop in.
27869/0:It was unbelievable -- SSC just hauled him off!  I wish I'd had my camera...
27870/0:Your evidence?
27871/0:He is, but the merger with the Helios AI has been problematic.  He has fallen into a state of near-catatonia and will be vulnerable until you can revive him.
27872/0:The black market biomod sounds great, but I haven't got the credits. [1000]
27873/0:There's been a hazardous spill on the Inclinator platform.  No travel to Lower Seattle.  Not that that's a bad thing...
27874/0:Sid Black.  Why are you still hanging around Cairo?  You do know that the medina could get overrun by Templars at any moment...?
27875/0:Too long.  Fortunately, this job is almost finished.
27876/0:Feeb.
27876/1:Ain't no use, ain't no truce.  Know what I'm sayin'?
27876/2:You picked the wrong man to move on...
27877/0:See?  Hang like a pack and we win.
27878/0:I want to take off this mask and run down the street screaming at my neighbors to do the same!
27879/0:What you waitin' for?  Cook this feeb.
27880/0:We got this dude.
27881/0:We got this chick.
27882/0:
27883/0:Interference with my systems will be forcefully resisted.
27883/1:No.  Do not jostle my bioelectric systems.
27883/2:I will not accept unwanted contact.
27884/0:Ain't so scary now, gob.
27885/0:Unbelievable -- the Chairman himself is a Templar.  Maybe you should locate the files he was talking about and confront him in the hangar bay.  But first check out that ApostleCorp facility.  Your assignment will be to eliminate Dr. Nassif before she gives any information to the Templar extremists -- or to the WTO.
27886/0:You might as well do what the Order wants -- you might turn up a lead.  The Nassifs run the greenhouse.
27887/0:Check it out: endangered species.
27888/0:Enough of this garbage.  We know what you did and now you are going to regret it.
27889/0:Move along.
27889/1:The Omar are not curiosities.  Stare at something else.
27889/2:We choose the Omar.  Don't pity the individual member.... Please go.
27890/0:(grunt)
27890/1:(grunt)
27891/0:Stop doing that.
27891/1:I will not allow that.
27891/2:No.  That is unacceptable behavior.
27892/0:No!
27892/1:Come on, punk.  Try that on me!
27893/0:I am authorized to force you to leave.
27893/1:I am to be obeyed.  Leave.
27893/2:Go.
27894/0:Get up, man!  You all right?
27895/0:I'm in no position to be disbursing handouts.  This WTO investigtor is about to have me bankrupted with fines.  Deal's off, whatever I might have told you.
27896/0:There's a dance floor on the upper level.  No rough-housing, though.  Someone could fall over the railing and get hurt.
27897/0:I will defend myself.
27897/1:Kill one of us and nothing changes.  I am just one node.
27897/2:Please withdraw your weapon.
27898/0:
27899/0:Action interpreted as deliberate.
27900/0:This is your third warning.
27901/0:Got it.
27902/0:Final warning.
27903/0:Report the truth to my seekers -- to true seekers everywhere.  What more would be necessary?
27904/0:Every minute the Inclinator is offline, we're ALL losing money.  Think about that.
27905/0:I have put my systems on alert regarding you.
27905/1:The expectations of the Omar are reasonable.  Please obey.
27906/0:Or "private negotiations."
27907/0:Situation precludes conversation.
27907/1:Danger -- please wait.
27908/0:Thanks.  You're clear to enter now.
27909/0:So we're the keys...  The gate must use some sort of DNA fingerprinting...  And since both Billie and I have Denton genetic code, we were able to use it...  It was never about the training, was it?  They were just perfecting the DNA...
27910/0:It was for utilities.  Then the canal dried up and you could get in from outside.  One of these times, I'm going to set a fire!  (exultant laugh)
27911/0:I helped a harrier pilot take care of an old debt.  He'll fly me in.
27912/0:Living in the medina is not always easy, but the Order brings me much peace.
27913/0:I could party all night.
27914/0:Every voice will be heard -- it won't matter who or where you are.  The stratification of influence will fade away.
27915/0:I was monitoring your conversation with Chief Morgan.  Looking for a pilot?  I'll fly you anywhere you want if you can help me.  They're holding me and my chopper captive on the lower level of this terminal.  The passcode to the hangar holding my vehicle is 00485.  My inability to infiltrate more than this terminal's communications grid has put my mission in jeopardy.
27916/0:I don't recommend going against a direct order from the Grand Master himself.  Besides, do YOU want to try to take on a modified Denton by yourself?
27917/0:dsadasd
27918/0:I thought this SSC gig would just be some quick money... never expected to see action.
27919/0:Can't afford that biomod. [1000]
27920/0:Who made it?
27921/0:
27922/0:Greetings.
27923/0:Greetings.
27924/0:It's ridiculous that anyone still buys low-tech QueeQuechinos, when they could have bioenhanced drinks like ours.
27925/0:That way.
27925/1:I believe that someone is over there.
27926/0:No information available.
27926/1:I am unable to be helpful.
27927/0:(gasp)
27928/0:Wait.  I believe someone may be listening.
27928/1:Stop.  Postpone this discussion until we can be confident about our privacy.
27929/0:Drone.  Proceed.
27929/1:Sending instructions to the drone.
27930/0:Never can be too careful.  These kids are pretty clever.
27931/0:Unable to open the door.
27931/1:This door will not open.
27932/0:This is Headmaster Archer's office.
27933/0:Direction blocked.
27933/1:Unable to proceed.
27934/0:Applying force.
27935/0:C'mon, man, back off.  Why every time we do a job you gotta schitz an' get us all fired?
27936/0:Do you mind?  I was thinking.
27937/0:I think the ice is a sign...  of what?  I don't know.
27938/0:
27939/0:There are always dissenters.  
27940/0:Okay.  I'll be right behind you.
27941/0:So -- you're performing in New Cairo.
27942/0:Without extraordinary individuals, civilization will founder.  Total homogeneity -- now THAT'S unnatural.  That's what we have to resist at all cost.
27943/0:Already tossed back a few pints.  May I say that I approve of your itinerary so far?
27944/0:We will RUN to the greenhouse!  Hurry, before your grandfather hears you!
27945/0:I know Saman says you're on our side now, but can I really trust you?
27946/0:It doesn't involve chatting with young women.
27947/0:He your brother or something?  Huh.
27948/0:Your notions of privacy are old-fashioned.  It was a love of privacy that brought on the Collapse.  A love of secrets, plans, and personal possessions.
27949/0:Hazard too great.  Unable to proceed.
27950/0:A dead body!
27950/1:A corpse...
27951/0:Something must have startled 'em.
27951/1:Uh-oh.  What's with the animals?
27952/0:How did this get busted?
27952/1:Someone needs to take the anger management class. 
27953/0:
27954/0:I don't think that's fixable.
27954/1:Wow.  Someone really went to work on this. 
27955/0:
27956/0:Hm.  It's disabled.
27956/1:How'd that get shut down?
27957/0:
27958/0:That's a serious malfunction.
27958/1:Hm.  Bad wiring?
27959/0:I wonder how that got turned on.
27959/1:I'm pretty sure that was off.
27960/0:I wonder how that got shut off.
27960/1:I'm pretty sure that was on.
27961/0:I think that should be closed.
27961/1:I don't think that's supposed to be open.
27962/0:
27963/0:The children are in danger.
27964/0:We're here to make sure you keep your mouth shut about Lt. Archer's project.
27965/0:
27966/0:Do not betray the trust of the Illuminati.
27967/0:Dr. Finstermaker, while you do work publicly at Mako, you must also attend to your responsibilities to...private contractors.  Contact me on a secure channel when you get this.  New measures have been instated since our recent problems in Chicago and Seattle.
27968/0:The jet's on the landing pad.
27969/0:Finish the job, and let's get out of here.
27970/0:Are you sure?
27971/0:I just hope Eeva's safe.
27972/0:Any questions?
27973/0:My lawyer knows how to prosecute pushy fanboys.
27974/0:Come on.  250 creds.  That's chump change for a pilot like me.
27975/0:....  Shut up.
27976/0:Yes.  We have saved you so that you can help us identify and defeat your creators.  Please listen to my High Augur, Lin May Chen.
27977/0:Small-time crooks don't need jet fighters.  Your guards are dead, and you're next.
27978/0:Now, I know you're both ready for assignments, but Tarsus is seeing everything through the events at Chicago right now.  Security is higher than ever. Soon you'll each be interviewed individually to determine your interests and suitability for assignments. We know you're anxious. Hang in there.
27979/0:The cost of a good defense lawyer.  Give me the money and I'll keep your dirty secret.  [750 credits]
27980/0:Trying to get to the roof?  First you'll have to deal with that beam trigger. If you're running low on multitools, you could just destroy it with an explosive.
27981/0:I think that should be open.
27981/1:I don't think that's supposed to be closed.
27982/0:JC Denton has a hold on your imagination, perhaps.  Talk to your friend Leo in front of the mosque.  See how much he likes enforced modification.  Do you really think ApostleCorp is any different than the sect of the Omar?
27983/0:Now how did that happen?
27983/1:What's going on?
27984/0:It's me, Alex.
27985/0:Huh.  It's missing.
27985/1:I wonder where it went... 
27986/0:Guess it's my lucky night.  Gob-zilla gets cooked in her own cage -- now Snake-eyes goes four-to-one against some lap-lizard called the Claw.
27987/0:That's not where it should be.
27987/1:Hey.  It's been moved.
27988/0:Whoa!  Looks like there's been a fight.
27988/1:Uh-oh.  That looks dangerous.
27989/0:I have to see your arcology pass before I can let you in.
27990/0:Oh I see, it's just a trick.
27990/1:A clever ploy...
27991/0:I guess I made a mistake.  I thought Tarsus put out a different sort of product.  Here's your money, bandita.
27992/0:Here we go...? //unsure
27992/1:Okay, I'm ready, I'm ready... //unsure
27993/0:Not again...  //tired
27993/1:Okay, this time I think I'm ready...  //unsure
27994/0:I'm serious -- you're in for it now.
27994/1:Are you going to try to take me on with your bare hands??
27995/0:Actually, I already talked to Miss Withers.
27996/0:(yells)
27996/1:(grunt)
27997/0:Thanks.  I would think that you and ApostleCorp would be bitter enemies.
27998/0:Order principles are meant to be universal.  If we can't absorb our enemies, then we've failed.
27999/0:Personally, I think it's about time Lower Seattle -- QueeQueg's Coffee, in particular -- got their own taste of terror.
28000/0:The WTO and Order have long been at odds.  Why the sudden flare-up in Trier?
28001/0:I hope nobody finds out.
28002/0:I'm a little confused.  I heard through the grapevine that you gave the WTO a tip that led to the assassination of the VIP Mr. Levine was so keen on protecting.  You playing both sides?
28003/0:Guess there's not much we can do yet.
28004/0:The Claw's gonna be hard-pressed to fill Gob-zilla's skin, but always bet on the trainer, I like to say.  How much?
28005/0:Right.  What was I thinkin'?
28006/0:Gotcha!  
28006/1:I got a hit!
28007/0:Just keep it up.
28007/1:I've about had it.
28007/2:You deaf or something?
28008/0:Go ahead.  It's your life.
28008/1:Stop!  This minute!
28008/2:Don't say you weren't warned.
28009/0:It's official -- no NG Resonance concert.
28010/0:You had me worried back there.
28010/1:Just settle down.  We've got work to do.
28011/0:Not now.
28011/1:Can't talk...
28012/0:Uh-oh.
28012/1:Sorry -- my fault.
28013/0:Hi.
28013/1:Hello.
28014/0:At ease.
28014/1:Officer.
28015/0:It's really too bad that groups like the Order can't see what we're working for.
28016/0:One Metro Pass, please.  [250 credits]
28017/0:Hi.
28017/1:Hello.
28018/0:Officer.
28018/1:At ease, officer.
28019/0:Just like I was at Tarsus.
28020/0:I need a matter clip.  I'll take it.  [400]
28021/0:... a gun... in his skull... (giggle)...
28022/0:Give me the ammo clips. [600]
28023/0:All this scandal -- I love it!
28024/0:Over there.
28025/0:Sorry -- no idea.
28026/0:Gotcha!
28026/1:I got a hit!
28027/0:At least it's over...  //shaken
28027/1:Oh... I wish it didn't have to come to this... // shaken
28028/0:What a waste of the program's resources.  //semi-calm
28028/1:It's a shame -- we really thought this one had potential. //semi-calm
28028/2:Hopefully we can salvage something for the project from this. //semi-calm
28029/0:Well... it's not unusual for a company to promote more than one brand of a product.
28030/0:I'm glad we found out about his bugs before we put him in active service. //semi-calm
28030/1:Maybe we can still recycle some of his materials so it's not a complete loss? //semi-calm
28031/0:You are a truly evil man.  You are awakening a being of such power that the human race will have no choice but to kneel before it -- unless we can turn its power to our own purposes.  May God give you the wisdom to right your crooked path.
28032/0:Gotta coach my gob.
28033/0:I'm glad we found out about her bugs before we put her in active service. //semi-calm
28033/1:Maybe we can still recycle some of her materials so it's not a complete loss? //semi-calm
28034/0:I missed!         // shrill
28034/1:Can't connect... can't connect... // anxious
28035/0:Oh no... he's getting away...  // deflated confidence
28036/0:The Templars are not murderers.  We just want what's best for humankind and realize that present circumstances demand sacrifices.  
28037/0:Oh no... she's getting away... // deflated confidence
28038/0:I can tell when a girl's had some combat training... HAVE TO in my business.
28039/0:
28040/0:
28041/0:The WTO ignored them as some tiny harmless cult.  Apparently they've got more followers than we expected.
28042/0:That's what they get for using a so-called "specialist..."
28043/0:The Omar do not take such actions lightly.  For this hostile act, all preferred customer privileges are hereby revoked.
28044/0:We want to bring humanity into the light.
28045/0:Don't let a bunch of pseudoreligious mystics turn you into an assassin.  Locate Dr. Nassif and interrogate her.  The WTO wants to get to her before she reveals anything valuable to the Templar terrorists.  We think she may be holed up behind what remains of the ApostleCorp security system.
28046/0:
28047/0:Your purchases will serve you well.
28048/0:Out.
28049/0:...a responsibility to share my research with the rest of the scientific community and humankind at large.
28050/0:What's your rate?
28051/0:Small-time crooks don't need jet fighters.  Hand it over or else.
28052/0:No matter what, Her Holiness leads this church.  We can accomodate a range of ideas under her leadership.
28053/0:Locate the power-assault armor schematic in this hangar.  We will be able to scan and upload it through your infolink once you find it.  You will also find information about your counter-nanite in this hangar.
28054/0:In the bull's eye today, WTO Security Chief Donna Morgan.
28055/0:Whew!
28055/1:Close one... // scared
28056/0:I can't get a clear shot. //shaky
28057/0:Ow!
28057/1:(grunt) I've been hit!  //shrill
28058/0:Pilot beacon's still giving me a flatline.  Maybe those poor sods in the flight bay know what happened.
28059/0:Ungh...  starting to take its toll.
28059/1:(grunt) I don't know how much more I can stand.
28060/0:Umph!
28060/1:(grunt) Don't!  I'm just a scientist!
28061/0:Ugh... must be... Holocyclotoxin-based...  unngh.
28061/1:(grunt) I've been hit!  Poison!
28062/0:(yells)
28062/1:Argh!  I'm on fire!!
28063/0:(grunt) I can't see!
28063/1:(grunt) My eyes!
28064/0:If you're ready to depart the Mosque, go ahead.  Scanners in the doorway will reactivate all your weapons.
28065/0:Noooo....
28065/1:Not like this...
28066/0:No use complaining now.  That's not going to cure me.
28067/0:(grunt)
28067/1:(groan)
28068/0:Living in a nanite cloud is a strange choice, but I guess you get what you pay for.
28069/0:You haven't seen the last of ME!
28070/0:A risky one.  With a big salary.
28071/0:The intellectual property has been secured and will be analyzed by our experts.  Well done.  We will have another mission for you as soon as you learn where Dr. Nassif went.  Look for clues in the biolab on the second floor.  We believe that ApostleCorp has sleeper agents in that division of Mako.
28072/0:
28073/0:
28073/1:
28074/0:This battle will be the first step in your purification.
28075/0:Get some rest.  Cairo is not as friendly as it was when you left it.
28076/0:Sure.  Off the main square, just around the bend from here.
28077/0:Nothing you can give me will help Paul now.  I've joined the Illuminati cause and Paul is dead.
28078/0:
28079/0:We'll show them exactly what our "pollution" can do in the field.
28080/0:Ugh.
28080/1:Umph.
28081/0:(gasp)
28082/0:Allow me to introduce you to the concept of vivisection.  Heh. // trying to be cool, but failing
28082/1:I'm not afraid of you! // unconvincing
28083/0:Don't forget that I received combat training in the program as well...
28083/1:I've had access to your file -- I know your weaknesses...
28084/0:... class of oligonucleotide surrogates capable of sequence specific binding...
28084/1:... which renders the surface nonthrombogenic...
28084/2:... a silicon piezoresistive pressure transducer...
28084/3:... polymer substrates through hydrophobic interaction...
28084/4:... subcutaneously implantable intracranial pressure telemetry transmitter... 
28085/0:You sound pretty upset.
28086/0:(yawn)
28086/1:(sniff)
28086/2:(achoo)
28087/0:Not now!  //rattled
28087/1:I can't talk right now!  //rattled
28088/0:Oops!
28088/1:Aw nuts!  I'm sorry.
28089/0:The lower levels become a ghost town whenever I sing.
28090/0:Tell me about this VIP club.
28091/0:Look over there.
28091/1:Head over that way.
28092/0:I have no money, but I'm a doctor.  I'd be willing to tend to any battle wounds.
28093/0:Excellent.
28094/0:Sid Black.  Harrier pilot.  Best flyer in the Western Hemisphere.  I drop my birds on the curb.  Spread it around.  I'm looking for another contract to get out of this town.
28095/0:I haven't seen anyone.
28095/1:I haven't noticed anything.
28096/0:I've risked my neck for less.  I'll think about it.
28097/0:We're not exactly sure what went wrong, but there are some radical cells within the Order that want to take more extreme measures.  They certainly don't represent the Order as a whole.  
28098/0:
28098/1:
28098/2:
28098/3:
28098/4:
28098/5:
28099/0:It was a baby greasel that got me.  The doctor caught it, raised it, and made a killing at the fights.
28100/0:I cannot talk right now.  Mrs. Rashidi would not like it.
28101/0:I mean it.  If you want a medkit, it's yours.
28102/0:Where to?  I always charge the going rate. [500]
28103/0:Our current plan nears closing, but we will continue our work in the shadows, as always.
28104/0:Time for you to go.
28105/0:He needs to upgrade the Helios core by merging it with your systems.  With access to a living host, Helios will be able to regulate the planetwide distribution of the biomod architecture.
28106/0:Suspicion naturally gravitates toward the nondenominational faith known as the Order.  But who are the Order?  
28107/0:Ready yet?
28108/0:If you want to even out the social order, you have to change the nature of power itself.  Right?  And what creates power?  Wealth, physical strength, legislation -- maybe -- but none of those is the root principle of power.
28109/0:Get outta there!
28110/0:I think the city's settling back down.
28111/0:Hello.
28111/1:Hi.
28111/2:Hey.
28112/0:Hello.
28112/1:Hi. 
28112/2:Hey.
28113/0:I know your schedule and I know it doesn't include this.  
28113/1:You're never going to graduate if you continue behaving like this.
28113/2:This will all be noted in your permanent record.
28114/0:Apparently your stealth training has been inadequate.
28114/1:I'll be sure to sign you up for more agility practice next week.
28115/0:This area is off-limits to trainees.
28115/1:This is a restricted area, trainee.
28116/0:Is there a problem with your vision?
28116/1:What are you staring at?
28117/0:Political thinkers of the Enlightenment were building a clockwork.  We need to assemble a genome.
28118/0:Stop acting like a nut.
28118/1:Such nonsense will not be tolerated.
28119/0:I am your superior.  This is inappropriate.
28119/1:I don't recommend continuing with this aggressive behavior.
28120/0:This behavior will NOT be tolerated.
28120/1:Clearly, you need some additional target practice.
28121/0:Enough with this nonsense.  Get to work.
28121/1:I think it's time for a remedial course on concentration and focus...
28122/0:Sssh.  
28123/0:I hope nothing else goes wrong.
28124/0:I -- I'm sure SSC will be sending help, any minute now...
28125/0:Crazy what you end up doing sometimes, isn't it?
28126/0:The lady can pick her gobs...
28127/0:I'm not much of an NG fan, but I will do whatever it takes to sell more QueeQuachinos.
28128/0:Hello.
28129/0:
28130/0:I don't drink it if it's marketed to snobs as a status symbol.
28131/0:Why not?  I'm not planning to spend the rest of my life in this place.
28132/0:
28133/0:Piezochem.... Medkits.  Respirators.  Bots for recovery and medical assistence.  Providing necessary products as we stand beside you in a difficult time.
28134/0:Yo, not now.  My gob's in the ring!
28135/0:This?  THIS is too much.  I can't believe it.
28136/0:I think I'm getting better.
28137/0:... just bumming around, you know.
28138/0:One of the guards turned up dead.
28139/0:Later, lady.
28140/0:You're quite the diplomat.
28141/0:You just gave the world another twenty years of chaos.  You have broken from me completely.  Do not expect to leave the island alive.
28142/0:All this commotion is probably just some non-enclave types trying to make some extra credits by smuggling.  I don't know that I blame them.  It's rough in Lower Seattle.
28143/0:What's the status on the search for their leader?
28144/0:
28145/0:
28146/0:For Cairo?
28147/0:Not likely.  Tong always has an ulterior motive, at least where I am concerned.  You have my authority to attempt a rescue, but stay away from that old fool.  He will lure you into the criminal underworld.
28148/0:
28149/0:
28150/0:
28151/0:
28152/0:Uh -- no one.  Is something wrong?
28153/0:Please leave me to my work.
28154/0:Right up ahead, Alex -- transgenics.  This research facility is where Versalife developed many of those creatures.  Sorry to say, the generator is at the back of the complex, in the northeast corner.
28155/0:Do not push your luck.  Leave me alone.
28156/0:Stay sharp, Chicago.
28157/0:You have no reason to see Miss Sak.
28158/0:Tough break about Chicago.  I think everyone'll understand if you want to take it easy these first few days.
28159/0:One of your own captains?  AWOL?
28160/0:You're well aware that some coffee chains use polymerized flavor additives, freeze-dried beans, even coffee proteins that have been synthesized by bacteria.
28161/0:You'll be able to breathe as freely out here as the New Cairo citizens do in their arcology.
28162/0:Doing business in the enclave is always interesting.
28163/0:It was good bumping into you, Leo.
28164/0:One too many strange events lately.
28165/0:I'm talking about the attack on Tarsus!  Is that what you do when people won't listen to your sermons?  You murder them?
28166/0:Somebody killed a rat.  It's a start.
28167/0:Hm.  That wasn't open.
28168/0:Hm.  That wasn't closed.
28169/0:Thought that was off.
28170/0:The QueeQueg's manager lives in Apartment 21 of the Heron's Loft building.  I bet you could find the code to the shop there.  Careful, though, he's always loafing around at home since he doesn't have to do the 24-hour schtick like us.
28171/0:Thought that was on.
28172/0:I cannot talk right now.  Mrs. Rashidi would not like it.
28173/0:I'll pay you back someday -- I promise!
28174/0:All busted up.  Man.
28175/0:Someone scrip'ed it good...
28176/0:Wonder where it is.
28177/0:Someone must've messed with it.
28178/0:Mr. Dumier said that I would be most useful in the medina, comforting our concerned believers.  Perhaps there is an operation planned against the arcology, but I did not inquire.  I trust him to take appropriate action.
28179/0:
28180/0:Try to have a good time.
28181/0:Alex!  You were right.  The Church can survive this.  Her Holiness sacrificed Herself so that we could make the Order into the world's first truly global faith.  What an extraordinary development -- seekers standing beside enclave chairmen!  I never thought I'd see it in my lifetime.
28182/0:
28183/0:You were mistaken.
28184/0:I don't want any trouble.  Let me just give you the credits.  [150]
28185/0:I wish I could get word to my uncle.
28186/0:Probably just more demolition.  That's Upper Seattle, you know, always growing....  We hear it all the time.  Hey, you must be overwhelmed.  I mean -- Chicago, the whole city.  Was your family from there?
28187/0:I need backup!
28187/1:I could use some support over here...
28188/0:It doesn't take a genius to see that they all want one thing: to force their system or whatever on the rest of us.  The world is doing just fine without a supreme leader.
28189/0:I need backup!
28189/1:I could use some support over here...
28190/0:You run a strict operation here.
28191/0:We're outnumbered!  We need some backup!
28192/0:I am trying to get ahead in Calculus.  I want to make it into whatever new elite program Tarsus has just started.
28193/0:Versalife abandoned their base, but JC ensured that we would be safe.  The Hateful Ones have upset this balance.
28194/0:We're outnumbered!  We need some backup!
28195/0:Guess a little bit of excitement never hurt anyone.
28196/0:I'm on my way.
28196/1:Count me in.
28197/0:Perhaps this means nothing to you, but Leila is a hero around here.  She is the one who funded the greenhouse.
28198/0:I'm on my way.
28198/1:Count me in.
28199/0:Wonder why it's down...
28200/0:Some feeb havin' a fit, I guess...
28201/0:A member of the Order.  Are you with the summit?
28202/0:Mr. Kirkpatrick.... Hmmmm.
28203/0:That wasn't there before...
28204/0:Stay sharp, Chicago.
28205/0:I thought that light was on...
28205/1:So you shut off the lights... oooo, sneaky.
28206/0:I don't remember it being dark in here.
28207/0:I don't remember it being dark out here.
28208/0:Hey, who turned on the lights?
28209/0:Shh.  You'll disturb their studies.
28210/0:I thought this door was closed.
28211/0:Hi.  I'm NG Resonance.  Welcome, Alex D.  Your last interaction was at Club Vox in New Seattle.  Hey, I heard you were in New Cairo -- and you didn't even stop by my kiosk to say hi.
28212/0:You will understand... We can sense it.
28213/0:Wonder who shut the door.
28214/0:The Nassif girl was one of the key candidates for nanite infusion at Tarsus.  Her whole family is likely to give itself over to that pollution, so they must be exterminated.
28215/0:A real pro came through here...
28216/0:Oh, you again.
28217/0:
28218/0:Thanks for nothin'!
28219/0:You don't want all the details in one dose -- trust me.  Why don't you come downstairs to meet the other trainees.  Refer to the map you found of the facility.  Billie Adams you know from Chicago.  Check in with her in Apartment 454 on your way down.
28220/0:Two words -- gob fights.  I'm not kidding.  Every night at the Greasel Pit, on the other side of the Inclinator tunnel.
28221/0:I should get back to work.
28222/0:Rip 'em to shreds!
28223/0:
28224/0:Citta... Citta... Citta... 
28224/1:Ommm... Ommm... Ommm... 
28224/2:My self-awareness isn't what it could be.
28224/3:The faithful will be rewarded.
28224/4:I wonder if I'll ever achieve samadhi.
28224/5:I think it's time to wash this robe.
28224/6:Her Holiness is so wise.
28224/7:My mind opens more each day to the true path.
28224/8:Can't get that song out of my head.
28224/9:Cat food, milk... what was the other thing?
28224/10:Need some more time on the range.
28224/11:All will be forgiven...
28224/12:Never enough time to study...
28224/13:So many new proclamations...
28224/14:If only my ex-wife had understood...
28225/0:Only thing is I can't afford the feebsville markup.  That's where YOU come in.
28226/0:Citta... Citta... Citta... 
28226/1:Ommm... Ommm... Ommm... 
28226/2:My self-awareness isn't what it could be.
28226/3:The faithful will be rewarded.
28226/4:I wonder if I'll ever achieve samadhi.
28226/5:Her Holiness is so wise.
28226/6:I am lucky to have seen the light.
28227/0:Sorry, I don't have enough money. [500]
28228/0:... I wish I wasn't stuck inside today.
28229/0:... I wish I wasn't stuck inside today.
28230/0:Beautiful weather. 
28231/0:Her Holiness fears we will take society through its next Prigigonic leap.  But she would accept our work over time.
28232/0:Beautiful weather. 
28233/0:Ack.  I'm soaked to the bone.
28234/0:Ack.  I'm soaked to the bone.
28235/0:I hope my next assignment is on a BEACH.
28236/0:It's probably the beer.  Sure you can fly?
28237/0:I hope my next assignment is on a BEACH.
28238/0:I'm EMBARASSED for you, Chairman.  Seriously.  You're kneeling before con-artists.  I'm turning red.  Look at me -- I'm turning red just thinking about it.
28239/0:Hm, a fire...
28240/0:More stinkin' smoke...
28241/0:Poor scab's bleedin'...
28242/0:You want me to steal a carcass -- from a nightclub?
28243/0:Wonder whose shadow it is.
28244/0:What's the sample for?
28245/0:More freak mutants every day...
28246/0:Wonder what happened HERE...
28247/0:That bot took a hit.
28248/0:(gasp) A body!
28249/0:Meanwhile, I owe Upper Seattle SSC a hundred units.
28250/0:Remember my advice, Alex.  You will need it.
28251/0:To be honest, though, I still don't trust you.  You let me down in Cairo.  My commandos will stay on high alert as they try to deal with the situation themselves.  Such will be the dictates of prudence until you prove me wrong.
28252/0:... humm hmm ...
28252/1:... onward Order soldiers ...
28252/2:(sniff)
28252/3:(achoo)
28253/0:Uh-huh.
28254/0:... humm hmm ...
28254/1:... onward Order soldiers ...
28254/2:(sniff)
28254/3:(achoo)
28255/0:I know I'm supposed to love all creatures as part of the grand order, but even the rats...?
28256/0:... including the dictates of a nightclub owner.
28257/0:I know I'm supposed to love all creatures as part of the grand order, but even the rats...?
28258/0:
28259/0:Meow yourself, heh heh...
28260/0:Eh?  Yeah, this job is for the birds.  heh heh...
28261/0:Eh?  Yeah, this job is for the birds.  heh heh...
28262/0:Yeah, I've got business with Leila too.
28263/0:Don't DO this, Alex!  
28264/0:I can't talk now.
28264/1:I'm busy. //sarcastic
28265/0:Dr. Nassif, I want to know the truth -- what's MY story?
28266/0:I can't talk now.
28266/1:I'm busy. //sarcastic
28267/0:Some scab thinks he's real smart...
28268/0:Stay true, young Pliable.  Now go to -- Wait!  Must be an overload... or a self-destruct sequence.  A blast door just sealed off the only exit.  You'll be trapped unless you can kill the power with the control box on the south wall -- or destroy the exposed conduits.  I guess the technician who worked here was a little paranoid about hackers.
28269/0:Guess there are worse ways to die.
28270/0:Out cold.  Scab's tryin' to be sneaky.
28271/0:Those are encrypted files.
28272/0:At least he's still alive...
28273/0:I will take my case all the way to WTO High Command if I have to.
28274/0:I would've preferred something more direct.
28275/0:At least she's still alive...
28276/0:Damn.  One mistake and that's it.  Won't let that happen to me.
28276/1:Scab must be playin' hit and run.
28277/0:One of those "dodgy business owners?"
28278/0:You mean the guys with the bug eyes and gray skin? Ugh.
28279/0:I think they've grounded the flights until they can figure out what's going on with that copter that was circling.  
28280/0:I have enough worries just getting profitable.  The Regional Director is reviewing my books at the end of the week.  My only enemy is Pequod's, and our battlefield is the customer.
28281/0:People are mad.  Sewer gobs killin' their kids, pollution, nanite swells as big as hurricanes, cyborgs in the alleys -- all fallout from the big labs.
28282/0:I've already heard rumors about this spill.
28283/0:The money will be deposited in your WTO credit account.  Mr. Nassif, trust me.  We will make sure nothing happens to Eeva.
28284/0:
28285/0:Let's go.
28286/0:Knocked her out? !  Gob-zilla?  Tina'll just pump it full of zyme, and it'll bounce back twice as mean.  There aren't a lot of rules in this business.
28287/0:They really want us to find true balance and order in our lives, which can only be possible when we're not being subjected to secret experiments.  
28288/0:Excuse me?! //sarcastic and serious
28288/1:Hey!
28288/2:I really don't appreciate that.
28289/0:Excuse me?! //sarcastic and serious
28289/1:Hey!
28289/2:I really don't appreciate that.
28290/0:Watch it!
28290/1:You're invading my space.
28290/2:Hey -- I just got this cleaned.
28290/3:Careful!
28291/0:Watch it!
28291/1:You're invading my space.
28292/0:We're the good guys.  Trust me.
28293/0:Watch it!  That hurt!
28293/1:Pay a little more attention to where you're aiming...
28294/0:We're not letting ourselves get threatened into risking our lives.  You can't fire us for having some common sense.
28295/0:Watch it!  That hurt!
28295/1:Pay a little more attention to where you're aiming...
28296/0:Please stop looking at me like that.  // sarcastically
28296/1:Take a picture--it'll last longer.
28296/2:Do I know you?
28296/3:All will be well, friend.  Look to yourself for guidance.
28296/4:Please -- I'm not an exhibit.
28297/0:You're done here.
28298/0:Please stop looking at me like that.  // sarcastically
28298/1:Take a picture--it'll last longer.
28299/0:What's that all about? 
28299/1:Very funny.
28299/2:Unwise, my friend.
28300/0:I heard there was an accident in the flight bay.  Sorry to spoil your plans.
28301/0:What's that all about? 
28301/1:Very funny.
28302/0:The chopper should arrive soon.  Thanks for your hard work.
28303/0:Excellent work, Alex.  Repair this Tower of Babel, and just when the King reaches out to touch the sky, we will be there to snatch his hand away.
28304/0:Okay.  A Templar paladin, an Omar cyborg, and an Order seeker walk into a bar.  Bartender says, "I'll make you a deal.  First one that mixes a drink that knocks me on my butt, you drink for free.  I'm gettin' killed by these novelty bars with their coconut and Day-Glo and paper umbrellas.  I need a drink of my own."  The Templar goes behind the bar.  He shakes and stirs and yodda yodda he comes up with a Bloody Mary.  Bartender knocks it back in one swallow.  "You call that a DRINK?  Tastes like tomato juice."  "It is the fermented blood of transhumans.  85-proof and laden with toxic particles."  "I don't feel a thing.  Next!"  The Omar goes behind the bar.  Puts his finger in a beer mug and fills it with a brown liquid.  "Tastes like maple syrup!  You couldn't get my grandma drunk with this rubbish."  "It is oil from my body.  Soon you will be one of us."  "Funny, ha ha.  I'm not seeing the hook.  Next!"  Finally the Order seeker goes behind the bar.  He just stands there.  "Well?" says the bartender.  "Make a drink."  The seeker puts a bottle of spring water in front of the other three.  "Water?  That's IT?" says the bartender.  "Drink," says the seeker.  The bartender opens the bottle and takes a sip.  He drops like dead man onto the floor behind his stool.  "What the HELL was THAT?" he says when he wakes up.  "The distilled teachings of the Church.  For a moment, you knew every thought Her Holiness ever had."  "Really?" the bartender says.  "Her Holiness thinks you poisoned her?"
28305/0:I haven't got the credits for the biomods. [1700]
28306/0:Any luck?
28307/0:Hey!  I live here!
28308/0:That guy over there at the table said he admires your work as Minister of Culture.
28309/0:Level 149 penthouses are reserved for arcology management.  Please conduct your business in public areas or leased offices.
28310/0:Wish I could help.  If you have a problem with the new policies, talk to someone at the SSC station across the square.
28311/0:Looks like the area's clean.  
28312/0:Cairo would be an acceptable destination.  I haven't yet searched Cairo for my passenger.
28313/0:Doesn't matter much to me.  Sure -- take a look.  Go over to the weapon case and get ready to press that button.  Meanwhile, I'll unlock the controls from the safety of my office.  No offense -- but I'm not standing out in the open while a stranger is fingering the trigger of the Mag Rail.
28314/0:ApostleCorp needs me now, and I'm stuck here.
28315/0:What else do you know about this spy?
28316/0:With biomods?
28317/0:You should reconsider that.
28317/1:You really don't want to mess with me.
28318/0:You should reconsider that.
28318/1:You really don't want to mess with me.
28319/0:You're not supposed to be here.
28319/1:Loitering is prohibited.
28320/0:The payment first, please.
28321/0:You're not supposed to be here.
28321/1:Loitering is prohibited.
28322/0:I think you need to move along.
28322/1:Ok, ok, enough of that already.
28322/2:Nothing to see here.  Move along.
28323/0:Aerostats protect every one of our stores, so you can be certain that your latte is grit-free.
28324/0:Show us what you can do, Alex.  With Tarsus gone, maybe a position with WTO Security would appeal to you.
28325/0:I think you need to move along.
28325/1:Ok, ok, enough of that already.
28325/2:Nothing to see here.  Move along.
28326/0:You're not going to prove anything by doing that.
28326/1:That's enough.
28326/2:Ow!  Do you have NO RESPECT for the Church?
28326/3:Look out!
28327/0:They'll track us if we take a chopper, but I think I can get us out of the Upper Seattle enclave.  Where are you?
28328/0:I have business to attend to.
28329/0:You're not going to prove anything by doing that.
28329/1:That's enough.
28330/0:That's not funny!
28330/1:You don't need me as an enemy.  Cut it out.
28331/0:What's so great about this club anyway?
28332/0:That's not funny!
28332/1:You don't need me as an enemy.  Cut it out.
28333/0:I wish the real NG would come to North America again.  She's awesome live.
28334/0:
28335/0:If you start to change your mind -- don't worry -- I'll be ready to pull the trigger.
28336/0:Auxiliary systems not responding.  Greenhouse shutting down.
28337/0:And you don't care where I'm headed.  You're ready to go anywhere I decide to go.
28338/0:
28338/1:
28338/2:
28338/3:
28338/4:
28339/0:Not disparity, but difference, and the well-managed specialization it makes possible.  Some people just aren't leaders and shouldn't be granted great powers.  The Illuminati want to ensure that humankind will always have a select few -- like you, Alex -- to inspire the rest.
28340/0:Stay sharp, Chicago.
28341/0:Sorry, old man.  I've got my own plans for these bots.
28342/0:Just having a little argument about who makes the best coffee.
28343/0:Billie -- what are you doing?  We all got the same orders, get out of the facility through Nassif's office.
28344/0:Stop staring at me.
28344/1:You're not going to intimidate me.
28344/2:Is there some kind of problem?
28344/3:Leave me to my work.  Go watch someone else.
28345/0:Stop staring at me.
28345/1:You're not going to intimidate me.
28346/0:Locate the power-assault armor schematic in this hangar.  We will be able to scan and upload it through your infolink once you find it.  You will also find information about your counter-nanite in this hangar.
28347/0:I already talked to him.  I'm too important to his plan for him to kill me.
28348/0:Curfew remains in effect until further notice.  All citizens should remain indoors from 9pm until 6am.  
28349/0:You are not amusing.
28349/1:Take your nonsense elsewhere.
28349/2:Having fun?
28349/3:Uh-uh.  Not with me standing here.
28350/0:You are not amusing.
28350/1:Take your nonsense elsewhere.
28351/0:Thanks.
28352/0:You really don't want me to accept that challenge.
28352/1:This is a serious offense.
28353/0:You really don't want me to accept that challenge.
28353/1:This is a serious offense.
28354/0:This area is restricted.  Leave now.
28354/1:You don't have access to this area.  Get lost.
28355/0:This area is restricted.  Leave now.
28355/1:You don't have access to this area.  Get lost.
28356/0:Move it!  Now!
28356/1:Get outta here.
28356/2:You're really trying my patience.
28357/0:Move it!  Now!
28357/1:Get outta here.
28357/2:You're really trying my patience.
28358/0:Ain't no one gonna get a jump on ME...
28358/1:Hm.
28358/2:Weird...
28359/0:I'm gettin' a bad feeling about this.
28359/1:This ain't gonna scrip'.  Not with me...
28359/2:Somethin' ain't right.
28360/0:I don't like it...
28361/0:I can't imagine where they might be.
28362/0:Real smooth.  Think I'm blind?
28363/0:Give me the biomod. [1000]
28364/0:... some scab draggin' his feet...
28365/0:Make it quick.  Championship's next.
28366/0:Breaking news:  The city of Chicago is under attack.  We've only just received the first reports, so little is clear at this point.  
28367/0:If it's not one thing, it's another...
28367/1:Hm.  Better not be psychin' myself out...
28367/2:I knew it was SOMETHIN'...
28368/0:Nevermind.  I'll stay out of it.
28369/0:Guess I was wrong.
28369/1:Startin' to freak myself out.
28370/0:Had us goin' there.
28371/0:Must be seein' stuff.
28371/1:THOUGHT I saw it.... Gotta kick that zyme...
28372/0:Sabotaging a bot production plant -- what were they thinking?
28373/0:This is an impressive campus.  It seems like a great facility -- nothing like the Tarsus I went to at their age.
28374/0:I can hear Ophelia calling to you.
28375/0:Live from Cairo, Egypt, where the arcology has been taken by a small military group called the Knights Templar.
28376/0:Decide for yourself what kind of world would sustain the dignity of humankind.
