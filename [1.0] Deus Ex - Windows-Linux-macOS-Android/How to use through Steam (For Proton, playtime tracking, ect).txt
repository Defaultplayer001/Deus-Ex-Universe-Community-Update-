The simplest solution right now seems to doing a "hard" install of the community update.

To do a "hard" install, you just copy the community update out of it's subdirectory (\Mods\Community Update) in your Deus Ex folder, into the root. Overwriting when asked.

Then rename the exe and inis in \System, renaming DeusExCommunityUpdate.exe&ini, to DeusEx.exe&ini. As well as DeusExCommunityUpdateUser.ini to User.ini. Again overwriting when asked. 

Then simply launching normally!

Note that this will break any of the shortcuts the installer made. Though you won't need them ofc if using Steam.
If you have any issues please let me know! If I have to I'll install Linux to help test, something I've meant to do for a while anyways.
