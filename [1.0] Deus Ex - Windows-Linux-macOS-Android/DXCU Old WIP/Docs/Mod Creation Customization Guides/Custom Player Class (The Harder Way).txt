Actual Custom Player Class:

	1. Hex Edit ConSys.dll:

		1. Open up ConSys.dll in XVI32.

		2. Search for text string "JCDenton", without quotes. Unicode enabled.

		3. Replace with custom player name, no spaces and has to be shorter then 8 characters! 
			Make sure to zero out blank spaces, not just replace them with 0s!

	2. Create Custom Player Class:
		
		1. Create an extension of Human.uc into your mod's custom package.
			Can use JCDentonMale as a base, deleting everything but defprops. 

		2. Copy any desired defprops from a chosen NPC / JC. 

		3. Set any names to be your characters name, instead of JC's.
			
			Alt (Better) version in Tack's Guide (Too long to copy here.) 
			

	3. Create custom DeusExGameInfo.

		1. Copy DeusExGameInfo.uc into your mod's custom package.
			As typical, give the edited .uc a custom name.

		2. Find "Class'JCDentonMale'", without double quotes. 

		3. Replace with "Class'YOURCUSTOMCLASSNAME'", without double quotes.
			
		Alt (Better) from Tack's Guide: 
			Create another .uc file in your Classes folder.  Call it MyGameInfo.uc and put this in it:

class MyGameInfo extends DeusExGameInfo;

function bool ApproveClass( class<playerpawn> SpawnClass)
{
    return true;







i mean literally, open consys.dll in xvi32
search for JCDenton
replace it, 0 terminate if name is shorter
