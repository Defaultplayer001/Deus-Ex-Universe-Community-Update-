This is an alternate step to "Custom Player Class (The Harder Way).txt"

1. Go to DeusExGameInfo.uc, under ApproveClass()

2. Change return false to return true.

3. Go fuck yourself, you just made your mod incompatible with any other DeusEx.u modification. 

This at least a catch all solution?

Should disable Multiplayer menu button, probably cause issues. 

Tutorial too, for neatness. 

Or better yet, DON'T DO THIS.
