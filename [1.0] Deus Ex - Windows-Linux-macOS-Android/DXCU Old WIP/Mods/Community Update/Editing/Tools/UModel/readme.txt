Some usage information:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a console application, there is no GUI.
For the list of command line options run 'umodel' without arguments.
Note: if you will launch program from Windows explorer etc, you will get a console
window with a help message, but this windoww will immediately disappear.

Keyboard:
H                full keyboard help
ESC              exit umodel
PgUp/UpDn        browse loaded objects
Ctrl+S           take screenshot
Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn   scroll onscreen texts
Ctrl+L           switch lighting modes
Ctrl+G           toggle OpenGL 2.0 / OpenGL 1.1 renderer


Notes about psk/psa export.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is a 3ds Max importer script (Actor X Importer) created by me:
http://www.gildor.org/projects/unactorx
Its announcements thread is here:
http://www.gildor.org/smf/index.php/topic,228.0.html


Notes about md5mesh/md5anim export.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To use these exporters you should add "-md5" key to a command line options.
MeshAnimation/AnimSet objects are exported as multiple md5anim files (one
file per animation track). "bounds" section in md5anim is filled with dummy
data. Also, "hierarchy" section does not contain real skeleton hierarchy,
because Unreal Engine uses hierarchy from mesh, not from animations. Some md5
viewers/importers does require md5anim hierarchy, some - does not.

There is a 3ds Max md5mesh/md5anim importer script available on umodel forum:
http://www.gildor.org/smf/index.php?topic=87.0
This script was originally created by der_ton, but was updated by me.


Notes about StaticMesh support.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
StaticMesh export made into psk format. This format is designed for SkeletalMesh
export, but umodel uses it for StaticMesh too. Exported mesh will not have
skeleton and contains only one UV set.
Resulting psk files are cannot be imported directly into UnrealEd.


Notes about material export.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Materials are exported in a custom format. File extension is ".mat". At the
current moment, this format is supported by my Actor X Importer plugin only.
Unreal Engine materials are very complex, it's hard to separate a few channels
(diffuse, specular, bump etc) from it. Umodel tries to do this using some
heuristics. Umodel will never export full materials (GLSL script etc). Do not
expect much from this.
