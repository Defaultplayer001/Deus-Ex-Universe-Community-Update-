Copy all files into Steam's Deus Ex root, and run "Delta Installer.bat".

By default in: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Deus Ex

Everything else are source files, can be ignored in case you want to make a new Delta Installer based on this. Nothing too complex, should be easy enough to understand.
