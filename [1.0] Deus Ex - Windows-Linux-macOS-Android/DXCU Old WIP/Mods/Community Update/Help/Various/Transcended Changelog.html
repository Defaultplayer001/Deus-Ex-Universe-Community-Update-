<h1>THE FOLLOWING CHANGELOG CONTAINS MASSIVE SPOILERS!</h1>

Preface: While creating the Game of the Year version of the game something must've gone wrong. While Game of the Year includes the *newest* code, it contains the *oldest* versions of the maps. So old that even the unreleased v1.00 version of the game is newer. 
<br>
<br>
These old maps are rough, glitchy, and unpolished in comparison to the maps released in non-GotY versions. As such, this mod contains the non-GotY maps, and then combines the following bug fixes on top of them. Bug fixes from the official maps compared to the GotY versions are not mentioned here.
