Collection of fixes in a framework created by Han and Bjorn of Revision.

Example of features:
Revision UI scaling, more finer grained brightness and mouse sensitivity settings, fixed resolution selection in the display settings (now displays all of the resolutions instead of the 16 smallest or whatever it was before),
fixed Effects channel for both AlAudio and Galaxy, being able to save on drives with huge amount of free space, and FOV selectior in the display settings.
