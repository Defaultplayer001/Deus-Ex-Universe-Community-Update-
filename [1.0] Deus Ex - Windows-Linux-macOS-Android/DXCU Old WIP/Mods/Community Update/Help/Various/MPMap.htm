<p>Making a deathmatch level for Deus Ex requires more than standard deathmatch 
  architecture. Many of the game elements have been balanced assuming certain 
  standard map settings. This document explains those map settings.</p>
<p><b>Computers<br>
  </b>In multiplayer games, all computers are supposed to start hacking automatically 
  and not allow login via password. Since we don't support randomized passwords, 
  any actual password would allow users to completely skip the hacking step, and 
  thus eliminating the usefulness of the computer skill. To remove the password, 
  set the Login and Passwords for all accounts on the computer to "" (that is, 
  blank). If the passwords are successfully removed, the computer will not have 
  a login screen and hacking will be automatic. </p>
<p><b>Keypads<br>
  </b>Multiplayer ignores keypad codes. Keypads are almost always used to guard 
  repair bots, and for nothing else. There are exceptions, but the standard for 
  the multitooling skill is that it allow Repair bot access and the ability to 
  disable turrets. Repair bots should be locked up with a keypad between 20% and 
  30% strength. Repair bot doors should close about 28 seconds after they open. 
</p>
<p><b>Locked Cabinets</b><br>
  Locked cabinets are used to guard alternate ammo types, LAMs, biocells, LAW 
  rockets and possibly other goodies such as ballistic armor. The standard lock 
  should be between 20 and 30% difficult. LAW rockets should be locked up at about 
  60% difficulty. Locked doors close automatically in multiplayer, there is no 
  need to make them do so yourself.</p>
<p><b>Weapon Racks</b><br>
  Weapon racks are used to distribute weapons. Every spawn point should have both 
  kinds of weapon racks (small and large weapons) within easy grasp.</p>
<p><b>Repair/Med Bots<br>
  </b>All bots should be set so that they don't move around. This involves setting 
  their orders to "standing", and setting all Stimuli, Reactions, and Fears to 
  false. </p>
<p><b>Cameras and Turrets<br>
  </b>In order to correctly inform your teammates as to which turret you've hacked, 
  each turret should be set with a distinct TitleString. This name will appear 
  when you put your crosshairs over a turret or when you or a teammate hacks a 
  turret. It will also be the name displayed when a turret kills someone. <br>
  <br>
  Cameras should be set with bNoAlarm false and bActive false. They will start 
  out off, and players using a computer can then turn them on. There should only 
  be one camera per computer, due to the extra network traffic required for additional 
  camera views.</p>
<p><b>Spawn Points<br>
  </b>Spawn points should be clustered together near weapon racks, approximately 
  100 units from each other. Clustered spawn points allow teams to spawn together. 
  Team spawning is handled automatically in code. As long as you provide sufficient 
  spawn points in an area, an entire team can spawn there. Since spawn points 
  should be clustered together in team games, this reduces the number of areas 
  where players can reasonably spawn. In non-team games, this can present problems 
  as players are more likely to spawn near each other. To solve this, any cluster 
  of spawn points should have mark most spawn points bTeamOnlyStart. Only one 
  spawn point per cluster should not be so marked. In addition, it is recommended 
  that deathmatch maps have additional spawn points. These should be marked as 
  bNonTeamOnlyStart true. This will activate them only in non-team games. </p>
