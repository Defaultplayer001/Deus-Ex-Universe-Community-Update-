<p><b>General<br>
  </b>Augmentations can seem complex to someone new to Deus Ex Multiplayer, even 
  if you are experienced with the single player game. There have been several 
  changes to the drain on various augs, and it takes a while to get used to these 
  new costs. Novice players are sometimes overwhelmed by the choices augmentations 
  offer, and it also takes experience to learn how the various augs interact in 
  a multiplayer setting. This section covers some basic strategies for using augs, 
  along with discussion of each aug's strengths and weaknesses. </p>
<p><b>Power Management</b><br>
  Managing your bioenergy well is essential to any play style. There are a couple 
  of general guidelines that can help make this easier. First, get familiar with 
  the various drains on the augs you have chosen. Knowing how fast something is 
  going to drop your bioenergy means you have a large advantage over someone who 
  doesn't. There are a number of ways to regain bioenergy that apply to all players. 
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Repairbots are your friend. If you are getting low on energy and don't 
    seem to be getting shot at the moment, look around and see if a repairbot 
    is close by. Access to repairbots is also a very good reason to buy up the 
    multitool skill. </li>
  <li> Biocells are also your friends. Stopping for a few seconds to pick one 
    of these up can save your life later on. You can only carry 5 at a time, but 
    each one gives you 50 bioenergy points, and those can go a long way. </li>
  <li> If your energy level gets very low, and all of your augmentations are off, 
    you will start to regenerate it slowly up to ¼ of your total level. This means 
    that if you can find a place to hide for a bit when you are very low, you 
    will then have enough energy to go out in search of more. </li>
  <li>Searching a body will give you an automatic 25 pts of energy. Few things 
    are as satisfying as adding insult to injury by using your fallen opponent 
    as a slurpee. </li>
</ol>
<p><b>Prioritizing</b><br>
  How you prioritize your augs is going to be very dependent on what style of 
  play you are most comfortable with. If you are a stealth player, then cloak 
  and run silent might top your list, while a more combat oriented player might 
  choose targeting and aggressive defense. Play with various combos and find out 
  what works best for your play style.</p>
<p><b>Dealing with Opponent's Augmentations<br>
  </b>If you find yourself up against an aug combo that you can't seem to deal 
  with, remember that you can change your augs during a game. Go to the multiplayer 
  augmentations screen and change your aug picks to something you think might 
  be more useful. When you die, you will start your next life with the changed 
  settings. Changing your augmentation choices in game will also affect any bonus 
  augs acquired during the current life. An emp attack is often the best way to 
  deal with enemy augmentations. Many players rely on specific augmentation combos 
  in order for their strategies to work. If they start to attack you, and you 
  drain their bioenergy, they are often sitting ducks. The best targets for an 
  attack like this are people relying on the speed aug to stay close to opponents, 
  and people relying on defensive augs to block your attacks. </p>
<p><b>Binding Function Keys<br>
  </b> In Deus Ex Multiplayer, just as in the single player game, Augmentations 
  are activated and deactivated using the function keys. Often, trying to reach 
  for a function key while in the middle of a fire fight can be awkward. For frequently 
  used or favorite augmentations we recommend binding a easier to reach key to 
  one of the function keys in the 'Keyboard/Mouse' menu. For instance, the Aggressive 
  Defense Augmentation is toggled on and off by the F9 key in Multiplayer. A user 
  might decide to bind the F9 key to the letter 'a'. Pressing the 'a' key would 
  activate (or deactivate) their Aggressive Defense. </p>

<p><b><a name="CombatStrength"></a>Combat Strength</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>Advantages</i><br>
    This aug has not been changed very much from the single player, but does have 
    an added dimension in a multiplayer setting. This aug works well for a stealth 
    player, especially when combined with a cloak. Hand to hand weapons will do 
    quite a bit of extra damage if you have this aug turned on, and getting the 
    drop on someone with a nanosword and combat strength usually means instant 
    death. It should also be noted that this damage bonus also applies to throwing 
    knives, which have limited range but a fairly high damage and a very fast 
    rate of fire, making them a viable option for a low tech specialist.</p>
  <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
    </i>No significant disadvantages to this aug, as it has a fairly low power 
    drain.</p>
  <p><i>Opposing<br>
    </i>This aug only affects weapons using the low-tech skill, and all weapons 
    of this type can be shielded against using ballistic protection. A player 
    using this aug will also have to get in fairly close in order to cause damage, 
    and listening for their footsteps can make it difficult for them to get in 
    close enough. Using the vision aug can also help defend against low-tech weapons, 
    since if they are in close enough to hit you, they are close enough for you 
    to see them. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><a name="EnergyShield"></a>Energy Shield</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>Advantages</i><br>
    The energy shield has a fairly low power drain, and a high defensive percentage. 
    This aug is particularly useful against a heavy weapons player, since it works 
    on the flamethrower, plasma, and wp rockets. It is also helpful if you use 
    it in conjunction with a plasma rifle at short range or point blank targets, 
    since you don't have to worry about hitting yourself as hard with the plasma 
    splash damage.</p>
  <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
    </i>This aug is only useful against the aforementioned weapons. If no one 
    in the game is using any of the heavy weapons, you have a wasted aug slot 
    and might be burning energy uselessly if you use the 'allaugs' hotkey.</p>
  <p><i>Opposing</i><br>
    The best offense against the energy shield is to notice if someone is using 
    it. It's harder to notice the blue shield effect if you are firing energy 
    weapons, so watch closely. If you are firing a flamethrower or plasma at them 
    and they don't seem to care, it's time to switch weapons. If you are the heavy 
    weapons player, you have fewer options, and your best bet is to get away from 
    them and hit them with regular gep rounds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><a name="RadarTransparency"></a>Radar Transparency</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>Advantages</i><br>
    While this aug is turned on, you will be completely invisible to turrets and 
    also to any placed grenade traps. This aug has a low power drain, and can 
    be left on for a very long time when combined with the recirculator. Radar 
    transparency is a must have if you are going to be hacking turrets with multitools 
    or placing a lot of demolitions. It makes it incredibly easy to walk past 
    turrets and remove enemy demolitions traps and make them your own. </p>
  <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
    </i>First off, you cannot take the regeneration aug if you take radar transparency. 
    Secondly, while turrets can't see you, other players still can. This means 
    if you want full stealth, you will have to take cloak as well, which has a 
    much higher power drain. Another important note is that while grenade traps 
    won't go off on you directly, you can still be caught in blasts caused by 
    other players.</p>
  <p><i>Opposing</i> <br>
    The main defense for this aug is paranoia. Check previously safe grenade traps 
    when you pass by them again. Keep an eye out at the turret and terminals, 
    since opponents with this aug will probably be spending significant amounts 
    of time there. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><a name="Regeneration"></a>Regeneration</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>Advantages<br>
    </i>Healing is a good thing. Regen is very useful if you can find a place 
    to hide for 30 seconds or so and get yourself combat-ready again. The drain 
    is also fairly low.<i> </i></p>
  <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
    </i>Regeneration has been toned down a lot from the single player version. 
    In multiplayer, you will only heal up 10 health per tick as opposed to the 
    40 in single player. The result of this is that you can no longer wade into 
    combat with this aug turned on and expect to come out the other side unscathed. 
  </p>
  <p><i>Opposing</i> <br>
    The simplest way to oppose this is to cause damage faster than they can heal 
    it. With almost all weapons, this is not a problem. This aug also makes a 
    distinct sound when it is turned on, and if you are close enough you can hear 
    your opponent healing. Half dead opponent hiding and trying to heal? Sounds 
    like a good time for an attack. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><a name="EMPShield"></a>EMP Shield</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>Advantages<br>
    </i>The emp shield has a very low drain and protects very well against emp 
    damage. This is also a great aug to use in conjunction with emp grenades or 
    the spy drone. Turn on your shield and fire off emp attacks at close range 
    with near impunity. Your enemy is suddenly weaker, while your own energy is 
    barely depleted. </p>
  <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
    </i>This only blocks emp damage, and thus is of limited usefulness. It should 
    also be noted that the shielding effect is lessened the closer you are to 
    the center of the emp attack. Standing at the fringe of an emp blast with 
    the shield on means you take minimal drain. Standing at the center of an emp 
    grenade will still drain you for a significant amount. </p>
  <p><i>Opposing</i> <br>
    Someone ignoring or lobbing emp attacks everywhere is easy to spot as using 
    this aug. Stay as far away as possible and hit them as hard and fast as you 
    can. If they are throwing emp attacks at you, that means they aren't actually 
    causing damage, which is a perfect time to dish out some damage yourself. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><a name="EnvironmentalResistance"></a>Environmental Resistance</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>Advantages<br>
    </i>This is another low cost aug that can be left on a lot of the time. Having 
    it turned on beforehand will block the vision wavering effects of poison or 
    gas, and greatly reduce the damage from gas clouds and dart poison. This is 
    a great one against players too fond of the crossbow. It works well in conjunction 
    with gas grenades. You can throw one into a room and then charge in and start 
    shooting. In this respect, it acts much like a flashbang does in other multiplayer 
    games. </p>
  <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
    </i>Turning this aug on after your vision is already wavering will not remove 
    the effect, though it will still block most of the poison damage. Another 
    aug that is only useful in very specific situations. </p>
  <p><i>Opposing</i> <br>
    Players blithely wandering through gas clouds are easy to spot as using this 
    aug. Once you notice that, simply don't bother with the crossbow or more gas 
    attacks and switch weapons. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><a name="Targeting"></a>Targeting</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>Advantages<br>
    </i>Targeting provides many advantages. It is effectively a skill increase 
    of one level in all weapon skills. This means that you do more damage and 
    have higher accuracy. The GEP gun will also lock onto opponents faster. Even 
    preplaced grenades do more damage if placed while target is on. This is particularly 
    nasty when combined with the sniper rifle or other high damage weapons. The 
    other advantage is more subtle, in that you can see how much overall health 
    your opponent has left. </p>
  <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
    </i>The only real disadvantages are the drain, and the fact that you have 
    to really pay attention to get the health info, and the health info is an 
    overall number, and does not reflect specific body parts. </p>
  <p><i>Opposing</i> <br>
    The direct defense against targeting is to use ballistic protection. This 
    will more than make up for the targeting damage bonus. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><a name="BallisticProtection"></a>Ballistic Protection</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>Advantages<br>
    </i>This will block 40% of the damage you receive from most weapons. This 
    is a great aug to use right before or as you enter combat, and can keep you 
    alive while you are being sniped until you can find cover. It is also very 
    useful to turn on before you cross any large open area, especially when combined 
    with the speed aug. </p>
  <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
    </i>Significant power drain. This really isn't an aug you can leave on all 
    the time unless you have a recirculator going and stop in at repairbots quite 
    a bit. </p>
  <p><i>Opposing</i> <br>
    This is one of the toughtest augs to oppose. Attacking someone with this aug 
    going can make combat somewhat frustrating. The moment you see that blue shield, 
    it's time to switch weapons or hit them with an emp attack. The crossbow or 
    energy weapons are probably the best to switch to. Anything that will disorient 
    the other player will help you take them out faster, and poison, fire, or 
    plasma will usually distract them at least into trying to turn off the ballistic 
    and turn on another defensive aug. Making the ballistic person multitask is 
    essential to taking them out. The effectiveness of this aug can be reduced 
    by using the targeting aug, which provides a damage bonus. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><a name="SpeedEnhancement"></a>Speed Enhancement</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>Advantages<br>
    </i>Turning on this aug doubles your movement speed and makes very high and 
    long leaps possible. This is a great aug for getting into or out of combat 
    quickly, or just crossing a large open space while minimizing risk. While 
    you are moving at this speed, you are much harder to hit, and incredibly difficult 
    to get locked onto with the gep gun. All in all, this is one of the most powerful 
    and versatile augs. </p>
  <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
    </i>While it is harder for other enemies to hit you, it is also more difficult 
    to target others when moving that fast. Combat can get very frantic very fast, 
    and overcorrecting is a common problem. The drain on this is also the highest 
    of all the augs. This is really only useful in short bursts, you simply don't 
    have enough energy to leave it on for long, especially since if you have speed 
    you cannot have the recirculator. Another important note: You do not jump 
    as high while carrying the gep gun as you do with other weapons. So don't 
    expect to be able to hop that fence with a gep drawn. </p>
  <p><i>Opposing</i> <br>
    Trying to defeat someone who has speed, especially if you don't, can be incredibly 
    difficult. Your best bet are weapons with some sort of spread, such as the 
    shotgun, assault rifle, or plasma. Explosives also work well, but you have 
    to remember to lead them pretty heavily. Hitting a jackrabbit with an emp 
    blast can also be fairly rewarding, as most people who use this aug a lot 
    come to rely on it heavily, and take time to adjust to moving at the regular 
    speed. Also remember that even if you are moving, you will still have a slightly 
    easier time aiming than the person blitzing across the map. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><a name="PowerRecirculator"></a>Power Recirculator</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>Advantages<br>
    </i>This is probably the simplest aug available. If you turn on any other 
    aug, the recirculator kicks in automatically. There is no drain on the recirculator, 
    so it never adds to your power loss. This aug is also incredibly useful if 
    you are fond of the 'allaugs' hotkey. Combining the power recirculator with 
    a few defensive augs and the 'allaugs' key can make you very difficult to 
    attack successfully. </p>
  <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
    </i>Having this aug means you cannot have the speed augmentation. Get used 
    to moving at the regular speed, and playing a slightly slower paced game. 
  </p>
  <p><i>Opposing</i> <br>
    There really isn't a very good way to oppose someone with this other than 
    emp attacks or using the speed aug to your advantage if that is what you took. 
    If your opponent has the recirculator, you are going to have to hit them more 
    often, since they can keep their augs going for longer. This means hit hard 
    and fast, since you probably won't win a war of attrition with this player. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><a name="Cloak"></a>Cloak</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>Advantages<br>
    </i>This augmentation is great for avoiding enemy snipers and for avoiding 
    enemies at a distance. When active, it is much safer to cross open spaces. 
    When you wish to use the cloak to attack someone, the general strategy is 
    to either maneuver around behind them, or wait for them to turn their back 
    on you. When they do so, draw a weapon and fire at them. After you do this, 
    it is often a good idea to put your weapon away, cloak again, and move. If 
    you don't do this, then your opponent will most likely return fire. And since 
    your opponent was not cloaked, he or she probably has a combat enhancing augmentation. 
    Finally, the cloak prevents the GEP gun from locking onto you, and will break 
    a lock if turned on after the lock is acquired. </p>
  <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
    </i>It has a fairly high power drain, so you have to manage your energy carefully 
    while using it. It doesn't mask your footsteps, so people can often tell when 
    you are nearby. Finally, while it is active, you have no weapon out. If someone 
    with the vision augmentation spots you while cloaked, you are at a disadvantage, 
    as your opponent is armed and you are not. </p>
  <p><i>Opposing</i> <br>
    The vision augmentation is the most useful anti-cloak power. At short to medium 
    ranges, it will display cloaked enemies. Since these enemies are cloaked, 
    they do not have weapons out, and are at a disadvantage if you choose to attack 
    them. If you do not have the vision augmentation, be alert for footsteps. 
    If you hear them, but don't see an opponent, you can try spraying the area 
    with the flamethrower. If you hit someone, he or she will catch on fire and 
    be easy to track. A WP rocket fills a similar role at longer ranges, if you 
    suspect a cloaked person to be in a particular sniper spot. If you have a 
    weapon equipped, and target a cloaked enemy, you will get white targeting 
    crosshairs. You get the same crosshairs if you look at objects in the world, 
    such as crates and doors, but if you get them when not looking at an object, 
    then you may very well be targeting a cloaked enemy. Many cloaked players 
    think of themselves as undetectable, so a shot at them while they are cloaked 
    will often catch them by surprise. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><a name="Vision"></a>Vision</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>Advantages<br>
    </i>This is the best defense against a cloaked player. It is also a vast improvement 
    over your usual crosshair iff. Friends will now appear as bright green, and 
    enemies will now glow red. This makes it much easier to spot enemies at a 
    distance, even if they are in shadows, and thus is great for spotting troublesome 
    snipers. You can also see friends/enemies on the other side of walls at very 
    close range. </p>
  <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
    </i>There are 4 main problems with this aug. First, you can only see cloaked 
    people at medium/short range. This makes the vision aug slightly less advantageous 
    on a larger map. Second, the drain on the vision aug is greater than the cloak 
    drain, which means they can stay cloaked longer than you can see them. Third, 
    if you are facing any kind of explosion with this aug turned on, you will 
    be temporarily blinded. The severity and duration of the blindness depend 
    on the closeness/brightness of the explosion, and whether you were looking 
    straight at it or caught it at an angle. Finally, the farther away an enemy 
    player is, the less bright red he will glow. </p>
  <p><i>Opposing</i> <br>
    The vision aug is directly opposed by the cloak. If you have the cloak, stay 
    as far away from this person as possible and try to snipe them. The vision 
    aug player is also very vulnerable to being blinded. Any kind of explosion 
    or grenade stands a good chance of temporarily blinding them. The flamethrower 
    and plasma are also bright enough to impede the vision aug player somewhat, 
    although they do not cause the same type of blinding effect. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><a name="SpyDrone"></a>Spy Drone</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>Advantages<br>
    </i>The spy drone lets you scout an area where you suspect an enemy to be 
    at reduced risk to yourself. Once this is activated it moves very quickly 
    across even the large maps, and is difficult for enemies to spot. The emp 
    attack has been enhanced for multiplayer, and detonating this anywhere near 
    a person will cause massive bioenergy loss. The drone is also useful to send 
    ahead and disable a turret so you can then run past. The spy drone is nearly 
    invulnerable while it is in flight. The drone is great to send alone up to 
    the top of that likely sniper nest and flush someone out. A favorite close 
    range tactic is to activate the spy drone and the emp shield at the same time, 
    and detonate the drone immediately. This is very surprising to an enemy at 
    close range and gives you an immediate energy advantage. </p>
  <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
    </i>This aug does have a couple of drawbacks. First, while it is active, you 
    cannot move. This means you better have a really secure place before you go 
    flying around with the drone. Second, having this aug in a slot makes it very 
    difficult to use the 'allaugs' hotkey without special planning. Also note: 
    while the spy drone can't be directly damaged by bullets, any type of nearby 
    explosion has a good chance of blowing it up. This means an enemy can defend 
    themselves with plasma or explosives, and you really don't want to get caught 
    in your own emp blast. </p>
  <p><i>Opposing</i> <br>
    There are a couple of ways to deal with an incoming drone. They make a distinctive 
    humming sound so you can generally hear them coming. The simplest way to deal 
    with one is to get a direct or near hit with some type of explosive or plasma. 
    You can also emp a spy drone, knocking it out of the air. Also remember that 
    while someone has a drone out, they are basically a sitting duck. </p>

<p><b><a name="AggressiveDefense"></a>Aggresive Defense</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>Advantages<br>
    </i>This aug has a fairly low drain, and is quite effective at keeping away 
    unwanted rockets. It is also useful as an umbrella for teammates, so if you 
    are close together, only one of you needs to have this turned on. This is 
    a great aug to turn on while crossing open areas. The offensive use of this 
    aug is when you turn it on while very close to someone firing rockets or 20mm 
    at you. The closer you are to them when they fire, the more likely they are 
    to damage themselves. The other nice thing is that you can often hear incoming 
    rockets and thus have time to turn this on quickly, thus negating or at least 
    reducing the damage you take. </p>
  <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
    </i>This is not a stealthy aug. Whenever you have this turned on you and nearby 
    players will be able to hear a distinctive sound somewhat like a sonar pulse. 
    This makes it much easier to find you if you are trying to hide. There have 
    also been some major changes from the way this worked in single player. The 
    only things aggressive defense will block in mp are rockets, wp rockets, 20mm, 
    and the law rocket. It will not block placed or thrown grenades, darts, knives, 
    or any of the other things it stopped in the singleplayer game. Also, depending 
    on the skill of the opposing player and the weapon they use, you may still 
    take some damage from incoming rockets even if you have this turned on. The 
    best example is the law, which will still cause significant damage to you 
    if you get caught in the open and try to defend yourself with aggressive defense. 
  </p>
  <p><i>Opposing</i> <br>
    Listen for the distinctive sound of this aug and be very careful before you 
    start firing rockets around. When you hear this aug turned on, or you see 
    a rocket detonate with a large blue explosion (much like an EMP explosion), 
    it's time to switch weapons to something else. Since EMP grenades are not 
    blocked by this augmentation, don't be afraid to toss one at your opponent.

<p><b><a name="RunSilent"></a>Run Silent</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>Advantages<br>
    </i>This is a nice low drain aug that is loads of fun for a stealth player. 
    Experienced players will be listening for footsteps and it's great to be able 
    to pop up without them hearing you. Using this with the vision aug to see 
    your enemy through a wall and then walking (or running with the speed aug) 
    up behind them is very satisfying. </p>
  <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
    </i>No disadvantages worthy of note, except you can't have its opposing aug. 
    This aug can cause a bit of overconfidence though. Just because you are being 
    sneaky is no reason to let down your guard. </p>
  <p><i>Opposing</i> <br>
    Again, paranoia is a great defense. If you can't hear their footsteps, sometimes 
    you can hear them switching weapons or activating/deactivating augs. Look 
    around a lot, watch for movement. The vision aug also helps a lot to defend 
    against this: they think they are sneaking up the ladder, you are watching 
    them through the floor and can mow them down before they pop their head up.

<p><b><a name="MicrofibralMuscle"></a>Microfibral Muscle</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>Advantages<br>
    </i>While this aug doesn't have any direct damage applications, (at least 
    in the premade maps), it does offer some interesting map control options. 
    Few people take this aug, so if you are the only player who has it, you can 
    move those large crates and no one else will be able to do anything about 
    it. This doesn't sound terribly useful until you realize that you can use 
    those large crates to strategically block off small passages or elevators, 
    and thus funnel your opponents wherever you want them. Blocking doorways, 
    air vents, and elevator exits can be extremely amusing. </p>
  <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
    </i>The only real disadvantage is that the usefulness of this aug is directly 
    tied to which map you are on, and if there are any large crates for you to 
    move. </p>
  <p><i>Opposing</i> <br>
    The simplest way to oppose this aug is to take it yourself. That or simply 
    go way around and realize that you are being channeled to where your opponent 
    wants you. The speed aug will often also allow you to jump over crates that 
    your opponent has moved. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><a name="Aqualung"></a>Aqualung</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>Advantages<br>
    </i>Using this aug will not only increase your air supply, but in multiplayer 
    it also increases the speed at which you move underwater. If you arm yourself 
    properly, you can get someone to follow you into the water and waste them 
    when they try to keep up. This works particularly well if you have taken a 
    weapon that works underwater (sword, knives, or crossbow). </p>
  <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
    </i>No significant disadvantages unless you are on a map with no water, in 
    which case this is just cluttering up your hud. </p>
  <p><i>Opposing</i> <br>
    If you are on a map where water is a significant factor, make sure you have 
    the aqualung as well, at least that way you are on an even footing. Also, 
    while you can't fire most weapons underwater, that doesn't mean you can't 
    fire into the water at your swimming opponent. </p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="+2"><a name="Weapons"></a>Weapons</font></b></font></p>
<p><b>General<br>
  </b>There are 14 different weapons in Deus Ex multiplayer, not counting grenades. 
  Most of them just deal damage, but a few have additional extra uses, and all 
  of them have certain situations in which they are more effective than in others. 
  Since you can only carry three weapons at a time, and since you often won't 
  be equally skilled with all weapons, deciding what weapons to carry can be a 
  tough choice. Generally you want to carry weapons that have different uses. 
  Carrying two weapons that do almost exactly the same thing (such as carrying 
  both shotguns) is a waste of valuable inventory space.</p>
<p><b>Accuracy<br>
  </b>Unlike singleplayer, most weapons in multiplayer are perfectly accurate. 
  They shoot exactly where you point. That doesn't mean they always hit, since 
  your opponents may be moving as well, but you can count on your shots to go 
  where you aim. This is not true of some multiple shot weapons. </p>
<p><b>Ammo considerations<br>
  </b> With the exception of the nano sword and the combat knife, all weapons 
  need ammo. Generally they carry about three clips worth. There are three ways 
  to get more ammo for a weapon. The easiest is to use an ammo crate. This will 
  replenish the ammo for the weapons you are carrying. Note that this will not 
  replenish throwing knives if you have used all of them, since when you use your 
  last throwing knife, you are no longer carrying that weapon. The next is to 
  pick up another copy of the same weapon from a weapon rack. This will replenish 
  your ammo with that weapon. Finally, if you search a corpse, and that corpse 
  was carrying a weapon that you are carrying, your ammo will be replenished with 
  that weapon. None of these methods restore alternate ammo (20 millimeter grenades 
  or WP rockets). You must pick up more of that kind of ammo by finding the ammo 
  itself. This ammo is usually stored in locked cabinets. </p>
<p><b>Hit Locations</b><br>
  There are three hit locations in Deus Ex Multiplayer. Legs, Torso, and Head. 
  All of them have the same number of health points. The torso is the easiest 
  to hit, and taking it out kills your opponent. Destroying your opponents legs 
  slows him down greatly and leaves him crouched and unable to jump. Destroying 
  your opponents head will kill him, and head shots count for double damage. </p>
<p><b>Reloading </b><br>
  Reloading is generally faster in multiplayer than it was in the singleplayer 
  game. In addition, if you put a weapon away, it automatically reloads itself. 
  This is not faster than the automatic reload when you expend your current clip, 
  but it means that if you equip a weapon and have ammo left, that ammo will be 
  loaded. </p>
<p><b>Skills</b><br>
  Weapons require different skills to use. In the basic team deathmatch game, 
  all weapons skills are at maximum level. In other gametypes, weapon skills may 
  start a lower levels and you may need to spend skill points to buy them up. 
  The effect of a higher weapon skill varies from weapon to weapon, but in all 
  cases, a higher skill means more damage. </p>
<hr>
<p><b><font size="+1"><a name="RifleWeapons"></a>Rifle Weapons</font></b><br>
  The rifle skill affects the Sniper rifle, the Assault rifle, the Assault shotgun, 
  and the Sawed off shotgun.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> <b>Sniper Rifle</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i>Advantages<br>
      </i>The sniper rifle is one of the most useful long range weapons. Bullets 
      travel instantaneously to point of impact, and at master skill level, a 
      head shot taken with a zoomed in sniper rifle will kill. Even torso shots 
      will do a significant amount of damage. The vision augmentation is very 
      handy with this weapon, since it helps you find enemies more easily. </p>
    <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
      </i>The sniper rifle does significantly less damage if the scope is not 
      in use. It also has a fairly slow rate of fire, reloading after every shot. 
      While zoomed in, you can't see a lot of the world around you, making you 
      a prime target for being attacked from behind. Due to its slow reload time 
      and need to be zoomed in, it is almost impossible to use this weapon effectively 
      at close range. </p>
    <p><i>Opposing<br>
      </i>Ballistic defense protects somewhat against the sniper rifle. It is 
      also very hard for someone to snipe at you if you have the speed augmentation 
      on and are running. The cloak augmentation provides near perfect protection; 
      since the distances involved in a sniper attack are generally much greater 
      than the distance at which the vision augmentation perceives cloaked people, 
      snipers will almost never be able to see cloaked people. If you don't have 
      these augmentations, try dashing from cover to cover. Snipers have to be 
      able to see you to shoot you. Closing very quickly with a sniper is often 
      a good way to kill one, since his weapon is next to useless at close range. 
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Assault Rifle</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i>Advantages<br>
      </i>The assault rifle is a fairly versatile weapon. It works at both close 
      and medium ranges, and does a fair amount of damage. Unlike most multiplayer 
      weapons, it is not perfectly accurate. When unskilled, it is actually fairly 
      inaccurate, although because it has burst fire, it tends to wound the opponent 
      some anyway. Standing still or buying higher skill levels increases this 
      accuracy, but not to perfect accuracy. This is both an advantage and a disadvantage. 
      It makes it easier to hit a target with some of the bullets, but makes it 
      harder to hit with all of them. The alternate ammo, 20 millimeter, is one 
      of the most powerful ammo types in the game. The 20 millimeter grenades 
      arc, and can therefore be used to shoot over obstacles with indirect fire. 
      They are also highly explosive, and can be used as splash damage weapons. 
    </p>
    <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
      </i>This gun is useless at long range when loaded with bullets. It is also 
      not perfectly accurate, and when firing, can burn through a clip pretty 
      quickly. The 20 mm ammo is very useful at longer ranges, but the arcing, 
      although useful for indirect fire, can take a lot of getting used to. You 
      must also be careful not to hit yourself with the 20 mm with a stray shot 
      into a nearby wall. </p>
    <p><i>Opposing</i><br>
      Staying far away from your opponent helps, as the gun is useless at long 
      ranges. If you can force your opponent to keep moving and firing, he will 
      be less accurate and may run out of ammo quickly. Ballistic protection also 
      protects well against this weapon, protecting you against both ammo types. 
      The aggressive defense augmentation will stop the 20 mm, and, if you are 
      close enough to your enemy, may even cause him to injure himself.<i> </i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Assault Shotgun</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i>Advantages<br>
      </i>The assault shotgun has a high rate of fire and does decent damage. 
      It works at short to moderate ranges. Since it fires five pellets, it is 
      fairly easy to hit opponents with at least one of them. If you are right 
      up next to your enemy, you can often hit with all five pellets. Unlike the 
      singleplayer game, higher accuracy will not reduce the spread of the pellets. 
      This is both an advantage and a disadvantage. It is an advantage in that 
      it makes it easier to hit enemies, but a disadvantage in that those hits 
      are less likely to be from all pellets. </p>
    <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
      </i>It doesn't work at longer ranges, and unless you are right next to your 
      enemy, you're not going to get any one shot kills, since the pellets spread 
      out. </p>
    <p><i>Opposing<br>
      </i>If you keep moving around, your opponent will find it very difficult 
      to tag you with more than one or two pellets a shot. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Sawed-off Shotgun</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i>Advantages<br>
      </i>The sawed off shotgun does a lot of damage, almost twice as much as 
      the assault shotgun. Like the assault shotgun, it works better at closer 
      ranges, and the pellets always spread at least somewhat. Unlike the assault 
      shotgun, it is much easier to get one shot kills. A full load of all five 
      pellets, with skill level 3 and the targeting aug will kill someone if all 
      pellets hit the torso. </p>
    <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
      </i>It has a slow refire rate, and doesn't hold much ammo in a clip. Although 
      very dangerous at short ranges, this isn't a very dangerous weapon at longer 
      ranges, even at ranges where the assault shotgun might still be effective. 
    </p>
    <p><i>Opposing<br>
      </i>Much as with the assault shotgun, try to stay out of close range. If 
      you must be in close range, take advantage of the slow refire rate to circle 
      around your opponent with a much faster firing weapon. </p>

<hr>
<p><b><font size="+1"><a name="PistolWeapons"></a>Pistol Weapons</font></b><br>
  The pistol skill affects the Pistol, the Stealth pistol, and the Mini-crossbow.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Pistol</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i>Advantages<br>
      </i>This weapon is a good middle-of-the-road weapon. It does a fair amount 
      of damage, fires moderately quickly, and has a decent range. It lends itself 
      well to a number of fast, aimed shots at a target. </p>
    <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
      </i>The pistol has no obvious disadvantages, but neither does it have any 
      clear advantages. For any given purpose, there is probably another weapon 
      that is more effective because of specialization. </p>
    <p><i>Opposing<br>
      </i>Escaping this weapon's most dangerous middle range is the most effect 
      defense against it - either close quickly or get out of range.<i> </i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Stealth Pistol</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i>Advantages<br>
      </i>This weapon features a very quick refire rate as its main strength. 
      It is used best on unsuspecting targets, as the quiet nature of the weapon 
      makes eliminates one of the main cues that players use to find their attacker. 
      In addition, it works well on stationary targets where you can land a number 
      of shots before they have time to react. </p>
    <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
      </i>The relatively short range of this weapon makes it useless for most 
      sniping uses, and it's moderate damage and fast-but-not-rapid refire rate 
      makes it both difficult to do snap shots and impossible to hose down an 
      area. </p>
    <p><i>Opposing<br>
      </i>Escaping this weapon's most dangerous middle range is the most effect 
      defense against it - either close quickly or get out of range. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Mini-Crossbow</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i>Advantages<br>
      </i>This weapon does a decent amount of damage, in addition to poisoning 
      your target. Poisoned targets have blurred vision and continue to take damage 
      for a short time. In fact, poison from crossbows kills more often than the 
      actual dart impacts. This weapon also works underwater. </p>
    <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
      </i>The darts have limited range, and, since they are not instant hit weapons, 
      often miss their targets. </p>
    <p><i>Opposing<br>
      </i>Stay a moderate distance away from your opponent and he can't hit you 
      with the darts. If you have environmental resistance, the greatest threat 
      (the poison) will be nullified. </p>

<p><b><font size="+1"><a name="HeavyWeapons"></a>Heavy Weapons</font></b><br>
  The heavy weapons skill affects the GEP gun, the Plasma rifle, the Flamethrower, 
  and the LAW.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>GEP Gun</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i>Advantages<br>
      </i>This is a great long-range weapon. It is very useful for suppressing 
      fire, forcing people to stay behind cover. Its locking capability is also 
      very useful, and has been enhanced from the singleplayer version. At short 
      to mid ranges, it is more useful than the sniper rifle is at similar ranges. 
      It also has an alternate ammo type, the WP rocket. The WP rocket does less 
      damage, but has a much larger blast radius, and anyone caught in the blast 
      radius gets set on fire. The GEP comes with a sniper scope attached by default. 
    </p>
    <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
      </i>There are a number of drawbacks to the GEP. First, more than any other 
      weapon, this weapon relies on higher skill. With the GEP out, you cannot 
      jump as high, run as fast, or turn as quickly. Skill reduces this somewhat, 
      but does not completely eliminate it. The GEP can be almost completely stopped 
      by the aggressive defense augmentation. It has a slow refire rate, and while 
      you're waiting to reload, enemies can trace the trail of smoke back to figure 
      out where you are. Also, because it causes explosions, this is not a good 
      weapon to use at closer ranges if you have the vision aug on.</p>
    <p><i>Locking<br>
      </i>It is generally easier to get a lock than it was in the singleplayer 
      game. To get a lock, try to hold your crosshair over the target. If it moves 
      off a little bit, your lock will start slipping away, but won't go away 
      instantly. If you generally keep it on the target, you should get a lock. 
      Time to lock varies from 1.5 seconds to 0.25 seconds, depending on skill 
      level. After the ammo counter indicates that you are locked, you will hear 
      a tone. While you are getting the tone and the ammo counter indicates that 
      you are locked, you are. If you have a lock and move your crosshairs off 
      of the target, you have about a second to move them back on before the lock 
      is lost.<br>
      <br>
      For the curious, here is how a locked on GEP chases a target: <br>
      1. If the GEP rocket has a line of sight to the center of the target, it 
      aims for that point. If it does not: <br>
      2. If the GEP rocket has a line of sight to the target's head, it aims for 
      that point. If it does not: <br>
      3. The rocket heads for the last place where it had a line of sight to one 
      of those two points on the target. <br>
      <br>
      The GEP rocket slows down a bit for turns, but it still has a significant 
      turn radius, so it doesn't corner exceptionally well. It doesn't cheat, 
      it only updates targeting information if it has a line of sight to the target. 
    </p>
    <p><i>Opposing<br>
      </i>The cloak augmentation prevents locking. It is also very hard for someone 
      to get a lock on you if you are moving around erratically. If a GEP round 
      is incoming, moving out of the way when it gets close often causes it to 
      miss, even if locked, as it has a minimum turn radius. Aggressive defense 
      almost completely stops GEP rounds, and ballistic protection helps. Also, 
      the rocket leaves a large smoke trail that indicates from where it was fired. 
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Plasma Rifle</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i>Advantages<br>
      </i>The plasma rifle is an excellent suppressive-fire weapon. Fires three 
      plasma bolts that explode on impact. It has a fairly good rate of fire and 
      good range. If you want to force someone to keep his head down, this works 
      very well. It is generally best employed by shooting at the ground near 
      your opponent's feet. </p>
    <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
      </i>The energy shield greatly reduces the effectiveness of this weapon. 
      The splash damage can also hurt you if you are firing too close to yourself, 
      and it can be dangerous to teammates. The energy shield helps reduce the 
      penalties of self inflicted wounds. </p>
    <p><i>Opposing<br>
      </i>Jumping helps to avoid splash damage from bolts hitting the floor. The 
      energy shield is very effective at stopping this weapon.<i> </i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Flamethrower</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i>Advantages<br>
      </i>This weapon has a very high rate of fire, and, if you back someone into 
      a corner, you can kill him with it very quickly. It also sets people on 
      fire when it hits them. This doesn't do a lot of damage, but it makes them 
      easy to spot, even if they are cloaked. The flamethrower can function as 
      a sort of alternate vision augmentation. If you hear footsteps nearby but 
      don't see anyone, spraying the area with the flamethrower may set your opponent 
      on fire, making him easy to shoot. </p>
    <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
      </i>This weapon has very limited range, and the energy shield is very effective 
      at blocking it. </p>
    <p><i>Opposing<br>
      </i>The energy shield is extremely effective at blocking the flamethrower. 
      If you have the energy shield, you don't need to worry too much about the 
      flamethrower. If you get set on fire, jump in the water or use a medkit 
      to put it out.<i> </i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>LAW</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i>Advantages<br>
      </i>Does massive damage in a wide area. Will even do a significant amount 
      of damage if the other person has aggressive defense up. </p>
    <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
      </i>Only one shot, but it takes up a whole weapon slot. It also requires 
      lockpicks to get. </p>
    <p><i>Opposing<br>
      </i>There isn't a lot you can do when one is actually coming at you. Aggressive 
      defense alone won't prevent you from taking a lot of damage. Aggressive 
      defense combined with ballistic protection generally works fairly well. 
      Ducking behind cover will also reduce the damage. All of these help, but 
      if someone shoots a LAW at the ground near you, expect to take at least 
      some damage. </p>

  The Low-tech skill affects the Nano sword, the Combat knife, and the Throwing 
  knives. All of the low-tech weapons are short range, all of them work underwater, 
  and combat strength helps with all of them. The speed, cloak, and combat strength 
  augmentations are all helpful when trying to use these.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Nano Sword</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i>Advantages<br>
      </i>The nano sword does a lot of damage and has a fairly high rate of fire. 
      In addition, unlike the singleplayer game, it has a fairly high swing arc. 
      The closer your opponents are to you and to the center of your screen, the 
      more damage the sword does, but you can still hit people at the ends of 
      the arc. This weapon also works under water. Combat strength greatly enhances 
      the damage it does. </p>
    <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
      </i>The weapon is fairly short range. It is also very obvious when someone 
      is using it. Equipping it makes a very distinct sound, and it emits a blue 
      glow around you </p>
    <p><i>Opposing<br>
      </i>The best defense is to stay out of reach. This isn't very hard. If you 
      have the speed aug on, your opponent will find it very difficult to hit 
      you with the sword, even if he has the speed aug himself. If you hear the 
      sound of the sword being drawn, move out of the way. It might be someone 
      uncloaking behind you with the sword. Often someone attacking you with the 
      sword is relying on the speed augmentation. Take that out and it is pretty 
      easy to defeat him.<i> </i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Combat Knife</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i>Advantages<br>
      </i>A decent amount of damage and a high rate of fire. Works underwater. 
      Combat strength greatly enhances the damage it does. Unlike the nano sword, 
      equipping it doesn't advertise your presence. </p>
    <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
      </i>Unlike the nano sword, it does not have an enhanced swing arc. Your 
      opponent needs to be right in front of you at fairly short range. </p>
    <p><i>Opposing<br>
      </i>Stay out of range. If your opponent is relying on the speed aug, EMP 
      him to eliminate that advantage. </p>

  <p><b>Throwing Knife</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i>Advantages<br>
      </i>The throwing knife does a lot of damage and has a high rate of fire. 
      It works at greater ranges than the other lowtech weapons. It works underwater, 
      and combat strength makes it do more damage. </p>
    <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
      </i>Limited ammo. Unlike the other lowtech weapons, you can run out of ammo 
      with this weapon. Once you run out of ammo, the weapon is gone, and using 
      an ammo crate won't restore your ammo. It is also not instant-hit, and therefore 
      it can be difficult to hit with it. </p>
    <p><i>Opposing<br>
      </i>Back up and dodge around. Your opponent will most likely run out of 
      ammo quickly. </p>

<p><b><font size="+1"><a name="Grenades"></a>Grenades</font></b><br>
  Grenades are affected by the demolitions skill. They include the EMP grenade, 
  the Gas grenade, and the LAM.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>General</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i>Advantages<br>
      </i>Grenades are fairly handy weapons. They don't take up slots that would 
      be used by something else; each grenade has its own belt slot. They can 
      be placed on walls as defense systems, or thrown at enemies as an attack. 
      Each grenade has a very different effect on an enemy, making the demolitions 
      skill fairly versatile. The screen of the player who planted or threw a 
      grenade will flash an appropriate color (blue for EMP, green for Gas, white 
      for LAM) when the grenade detonates. This is useful for knowing when grenades 
      you have planted are being detonated.</p>
    <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
      </i>You can only carry three grenades of each type at any time, and many 
      of the grenades are locked up. Also, thrown grenades will blow up if an 
      explosion goes off nearby. The two most common ways this can happen are 
      throwing a second LAM too soon after throwing the first, or by throwing 
      a grenade when someone is shooting a plasma rifle at you. </p>
    <p><i>Opposing<br>
      </i>Placed grenades can be neutralized in several ways. Radar transparency 
      allows you to walk past them without setting them off. You can then pick 
      them up off of the wall and place them again. This leaves them in essentially 
      the same place, but on your side. Many enemies will assume the grenade is 
      still friendly. If you have a higher demolitions skill than the person placing 
      the grenade, you have some time to locate and disarm it after you hear the 
      beeping sound. EMP explosions will disable nearby grenades, and regular 
      explosions will set them off. Since explosions penetrate a short distance 
      through walls, one tactic when assaulting an enemy base is to blow up a 
      rocket on the outside of the entrance, thereby exploding any grenades inside 
      the entrance. The explosions from the grenades may injure the defending 
      team. The best way to deal with thrown grenades is to dodge them. Thrown 
      grenades make distinctive noises when they bounce along the ground. If you 
      move quickly you can avoid most of the blast. </p>
    <p><i>Placing</i><br>
      When placing a grenade, remember that the targeting augmentation enhances 
      your skill, and thus the damage done. It will make the grenade more effective 
      when it actually goes off. Try not to place EMP grenades near other grenades, 
      or else the explosion from your EMP grenade may disable the other grenades. 
      The best place to place a grenade is in a location where, when your opponent 
      comes into range to set them off, he can't quickly get away. One prime example 
      is on the inside of a door. When he opens the door, he will often sit there 
      for a second waiting for the door to open. During that time, the grenade 
      can go off and kill him. On the other hand, if you place grenades where 
      people expect them, they can blow them up or disable them and use them against 
      you. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>EMP Grenade</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i>Advantages<br>
      EMP grenades are one of the only two ways in the game to do EMP damage. 
      If you hit an enemy with one of these, he will most likely run out of energy 
      and be at a significant disadvantage. </i></p>
    <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
      If placed too near other grenades, an opponent may set one of these off 
      before your other placed grenades, thus disabling your other grenades. Also, 
      if your opponent was already out of bio energy, then this attack will do 
      nothing. </i></p>
    <p><i>Opposing<br>
      The EMP shield provides a lot of protection against these. When you do have 
      the EMP shield, it often allows you to catch your opponents at a disadvantage. 
      They expect you to have run out of bioenergy, but the shield has prevented 
      you from running out. Carrying biocells around also helps lessen the negative 
      effects. </i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Gas Grenade</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i>Advantages<br>
      </i>Gas grenades are a fairly safe way to slow down your opponents. They 
      are unlikely to injure you or your opponent overmuch, but the vision blurring 
      effect can help you run away. When combined with environmental resistance, 
      they can be used much like flashbangs. You can toss one into a room and 
      then charge in, immune to the gas. These grenades are also handy to place 
      near friendly turrets. An enemy that sets off the grenade will be stumbling 
      around while the turret fires. </p>
    <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
      </i>They don't do a lot of damage, and the gas clouds move unpredictably. 
      Often you will hit yourself at least a little with these if you are not 
      very careful. </p>
    <p><i>Opposing</i><br>
      Environmental resistance works well if turned on before you get hit by any 
      poison gas. The gas also isn't that dangerous, if your opponent is badly 
      wounded and you are not, it can be worth pursuing him through the gas to 
      finish him off.<i> </i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>LAM</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i>Advantages<br>
      </i>Very dangerous as a hurled explosive. Unlike the other two grenades, 
      the LAM deals a lot of direct damage. If a LAM explosion goes off near an 
      enemy, either from a preplaced LAM or a well thrown one, it will most likely 
      kill your opponent. </p>
    <p><i>Disadvantages<br>
      </i>They can be fairly dangerous as well. If you throw one and it blows 
      up in midair (due to a nearby explosion) before it gets very far away from 
      you, you are likely to kill yourself. </p>
    <p><i>Opposing<br>
      </i>Ballistic protection helps protect against the damage, dodging is best.<i> 
      </i></p>

  Inventory Items</font></b></font></p>
<p><b>Lockpicks<br>
  </b>Lockpicks enable you to open locked cabinets and doors. These 
  cabinets are usually the only source for biocells, LAMs, 20 mm ammo, WP rockets, 
  and the LAW. Higher skill in lockpicking significantly decreases the time it 
  takes to pick a lock. This is a very useful skill for someone wishing to use 
  explosives, as it provides 4 types of explosive (2 alternate ammo types, LAMs, 
  and the LAW). The biocells are also useful for stealthy players.</p>
<p><b>Multitools</b><br>
  Multitools allow you to disable turrets and access repair bots. Higher skill 
  in multitooling significantly decreases the time it takes to pick a lock. Anyone 
  who wants to be able to spend a lot of energy should buy at least one level 
  of this skill.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Medkits</b><br>
  Medkits remove poison and extinguish fire. If you have no legs and use a medkit, 
  it will distribute the first healing points to your legs so that you will be 
  able to walk again. Except in that case, it heals your head first, then your 
  torso, and then your legs. Higher levels of medicine skill greatly increase 
  the number of points healed. It is generally a good idea to keep one on your 
  person at all times in case you lose your legs or get poisoned. If you use it 
  to cure poison, make sure you aren't about to get poisoned again immediately 
  afterwards. </p>
<p><b>BioCells<br>
  </b>Biocells are extremely handy. They restore half of your bio energy, and 
  are essential for anyone wanting to constantly be using augs with a high combined 
  energy drain. They are almost always locked up inside locked cabinets.<b> </b></p>
<hr>
<p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="+2"><a name="MiscItemsInWorld"></a>Misc 
  Items in World</font></b></font></p>
<p><b>Repair Bots</b><br>
  Repair bots are almost always locked up behind keypad doors. A multitool is 
  required to access them. Using one instantly restores your bio energy to max. 
  It takes about 30 seconds before it can be used again. You can take advantage 
  of this to deny someone else the ability to use one for that time. On maps with 
  very few of these, they can be very strategically important. If you can occupy 
  a position near one, you can keep your augs on for a very long time.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>MedBots<br>
  </b>Medbots are like super medkits. If you use one it will remove poison, extinguish 
  fire, and fully heal you. It cannot be used again for 30 seconds. Even if you 
  need no healing, you can use one in order to use up its power for the next 30 
  seconds and deny it to your enemies. It is a good idea to know where they are 
  on the map so that you can get to them if you need it.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Turrets<br>
  </b>Turrets are extremely powerful allies to have on your side. If a turret 
  is on your side, it will show up with green crosshairs and will be green in 
  the vision augmentation. Turrets can see cloaked enemies. If a turret appears 
  to be firing at nothing, it is probably a cloaked enemy. They only fire at medium 
  range, but they do a lot of damage and they don't miss. Turrets that are on 
  your side stay side even if you die, unless an opponent specifically changes 
  them.</p>
<p> When a turret switches teams, it will beep for a few seconds before becoming 
  fully active and firing. If the turret was previously friendly, it is now hostile 
  and should be avoided. Turrets can be temporarily disabled with EMP damage, 
  made neutral by multitooling them, or turned to your team by using the appropriate 
  computer. Changing the status of a turret with a multitool or via computer will 
  also change the status of the associated camera.</p>
<p>To get past a turret completely safely use radar transparency or an EMP attack. 
  An EMP attack has the disadvantage of warning the opposition that you are coming. 
  Ballistic protection and the speed augmentation can help reduce the damage the 
  turret does to you as you go past. Finally, there is generally a back way around 
  the turret. The turret is often blocking the most convenient route, but it rarely 
  blocks all routes. </p>
<p><b>Cameras<br>
  </b>Cameras are not incredibly useful, but you don't have to do much with them 
  to take advantage of what they do provide. While using a computer, you can look 
  through them to see enemies approaching, assuming that they are not cloaked. 
  If a camera is on your side, it will track enemy players and beep warningly. 
  You can even watch this through the viewport screen to see where your enemy 
  goes. Changing the status of a camera with a multitool or via computer will 
  also change the status of the associated turret(if any).<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Computers<br>
  </b>Hacking a computer allows you to look through the attached camera and change 
  the allegiance of the attached turret. While you are hacking, however, you are 
  extremely vulnerable as you cannot see around you. On the lowest skill level, 
  hacking a computer takes about 25 seconds, which is a very long time to be sitting 
  around. It is recommended that you cloak or get a teammate to cover you while 
  using a computer. Even while cloaked, you aren't completely safe. If you notice 
  an open computer but don't see anyone using it, there is probably a cloaked 
  person sitting next to it, using it. Finally, if you let time run out while 
  using a computer, you will take a lot of EMP damage.</p>
<p> <b>Locked Cabinets<br>
  </b>These generally contain very nice items, such as biocells and 20 mm ammo. 
  At low lockpicking skills, they can take a fair amount of time to open, so make 
  sure that you are safe before attempting to open one.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Water<br>
  </b>Water can be a very handy defensive terrain feature. Jumping in water will 
  put out fire. Most weapons also do not work underwater, so it can be a handy 
  way to escape pursuit. If you have a weapon that works underwater and your opponent 
  doesn't, you can generally easily trounce him, especially if you have aqualung.<b> 
  </b></p>
<p><b>TNT Crates<br>
  </b>TNT crates are highly explosive. It is possible to kill someone with a hurled 
  crate, but it is also quite easy to kill yourself with one. If you crouch and 
  set it down, it won't explode when you drop it.</p>
<p><b>Ammo Crates<br>
  </b>Ammo crates are generally scattered generously across the map. Using one 
  restores the ammo of your weapons. It is a good idea to use these occasionally, 
  even if you don't think you're low on ammo, just to make sure.</p>
<hr>
<p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="+2"><a name="Skills"></a>Skills</font></b></font></p>
<p><b>Weapon Skills<br>
  </b>With the exception of Demolitions, all weapon skills cost 2000 points to 
  upgrade. The main advantage of higher weapon skill is increased damage with 
  weapons of that type. In addition, heavy weapon skill decreases the movement 
  penalty with heavy weapons, and decreases the amount of time it takes to lock 
  with the GEP gun. Demolitions skill costs only 1000 points to upgrade, and can 
  increase the amount of time you have to react to a placed grenade. </p>
<p><b>Multitooling</b><br>
  Reduces the amount of time it takes to open something with a multitool, and 
  reduces the number of tools needed. Very useful for a player who wants to have 
  access to a lot of energy. </p>
<p><b>Lockpicking </b><br>
  Reduces the amount of time and number of picks needed to open something with 
  a lockpick. This is a very useful skill for sneakier players, as it allows easier 
  access to various goodies. </p>
<p><b>Computer</b><br>
  Greatly decreases the time required to hack into a computer, as well as the 
  penalty for staying logged in too long. If you intend to hack computers regularly, 
  you should buy at least one level of this skill. </p>
<p><b>Environmental Training </b><br>
  Improves the duration and effectiveness of ballistic armor, rebreathers, thermoptic 
  camo, and hazmat suits. None of these are included in the levels provided with 
  the multiplayer patch, so this skill is not recommended as particularly useful. 
  It is included in the event that other people want to add such items. </p>

  <blockquote> 
    <p>As soon as an opponent is within short to medium range, turn on all of

      drone by pressing fire. The EMP blast will have very little effect on you 
      since you have EMP shield turned on. Your opponent however, will be without 
      any augmentations for a time. Meanwhile you will be ready to engage with 
      an entire group of combat augs running. This tactic takes only a few seconds 
      to use. This augmentation strategy is particularly useful against opponents 
      who attack by rushing and strafing with the Speed Augmentation. They are 
      instantly neutralized by the EMP blast of the spy drone. Since you have 
      energy shield, the plasma rifle is a fairly good choice of weapon, as the 
      energy shield will protect you from the splash damage from your own gun.</p>

    <p>This is a generally good combination for a player that wants to be aggressive. 
      Vision allows you to find target quickly, and targeting increases damage 
      when attacking. Radar Transparency and Aggresive Defense allow you to be 
      relatively oblivous to surprising or long-range dangers so you can concentrate 
      on your target. It's a moderately expensive combination, bioenergy-wise, 
      so a Lockpick allows you to both accumulate biocells and other offensive 
      goodies like 20mm or WP rockets. This combination works well with virtually 
      any weapon class, though the Assault Rifle and Plasma Rifle work especially 
      well. </p>

<p><b>Teamplay</b><br>
  Most team play support is automatic in nature. There are no provided hotkeys 
  for instant messages. There are various automatic tools in place to help you 
  work with teammates:</p>
<ol>
  <li> The aggressive defense augmentation does not target teammates projectiles, 
    and, in fact, will help protect nearby teammates from incoming fire. </li>
  <li>If a teammate takes over a turret, a message is automatically sent to you 
    telling you what has occurred. </li>
  <li> Teammates take reduced damage from your shots, depending on the friendly 
    fire setting on the server. </li>
  <li> Cloaked teammates are still visible to you as merely translucent characters. 
  </li>
  <li> Most importantly, you tend to spawn near your teammates. If your teammates 
    are holding a spawning area (These are near weapon racks, and differ between 
    team and nonteam games), then when you die you will respawn near them, unless 
    too many enemies are nearby. This helps teams hold a particular position, 
    such as the hangar on the bunker map. </li>
