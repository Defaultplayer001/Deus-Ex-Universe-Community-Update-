<hr>
<p>Deus Ex Multiplayer ("DXMP") allows you to play competitive games against other 
  players in two game types: Death Match and Team Death Match. </p>
<ul>
  <li>In Death Match, the object is to kill other player characters and each player 
    opposes every other payer. </li>
  <li> In Team Death Match, the players are divided into two opposing teams and 
    the goal is to kill characters on the other team.</li>
</ul>
<p>DXMP does not allow cooperative play through the single-player story and, in 
  the maps provided with this patch, there are no AI opponents. The action is 
  strictly player versus player (or team versus team). Maps created for the single-player 
  version of Deus Ex cannot be used for multiplayer games -- only multiplayer 
  maps will work. You can recognize a multiplayer map because the map name is 
  prefaced with "dxmp" (e.g., "dxmp_silo.dx").</p>
<p>Deus Ex is as much about character development as it is about player skill. 
  That's as true of Deus Ex multiplayer as it is of the singleplayer game. That 
  means the experience of playing DXMP is a little different than you might be 
  used to, if you're an experienced player of some of the more traditional deathmatch 
  games. In Deus Ex you won't move as quickly; weapons aren't as accurate; and 
  your character's weapon skill levels have a dramatic impact on weapon effectiveness. 
</p>
<p>The solution to these "problems" lies in exploiting the skill and augmentation 
  systems: </p>
<p>If you feel like you're moving too slowly, note that you always have the Speed 
  augmentation. Use it and you'll move much faster, jump further and be harder 
  to hit. (You'll also have to be on the lookout for bioelectric cells, but that 
  may be a tradeoff you want to make...) </p>
<p>If your weapons seem inaccurate, increase your skills appropriately (see below). 
  <br>
</p>
<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>: Many things are different from the Deus Ex single-player 
  game! This readme file outlines those differences.</p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="CreatingACharacter"></a>Creating 
  a Character</font></b></font></p>
<p>Before joining your first game, go to the main menu and select "Multiplayer." 
</p>
<p>From there, select "Player Setup." Here you can pick your name, appearance, 
  team, connection type and whether you want pop-up help messages to appear as 
  you play. If you've selected <i>Auto</i> as your team designation, when joining 
  a game, you will be automatically assigned to the team with fewer players.</p>
<p>On the "Multiplayer" menu you will see a listing for "Augmentations." You may 
  want to select this option to go to the Augmentations screen. If you want to 
  jump right in, you can use the default augmentation selections we've provided. 
  If you want to customize your character, you can use the Augmentation screen 
  to determine which augmentations your character has. See the "Augmentations" 
  section of this readme file for more information.</p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="KeyBindings"></a>Key 
  Bindings</font></b></font></p>
<p>The following key bindings are important for DXMP play. These functions should 
  be bound to keys of your choice in the the Keyboard/Mouse Menu. Keys are rebound 
  in multiplayer just as they are in single-player. These functions should be 
  bound to keys before starting a DXMP game for the first time! </p>
<ul>
  <li>Team Chat </li>
  <li>Chat </li>
  <li>Show Scores </li>
  <li>Buy Skills </li>
  <li>Show Multiplayer Kill Details </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that in the multiplayer version of Deus Ex you can remap the Function 
  keys so augmentations can be activated from any keys on the keyboard.<br>
  <br>
  Also, the following are the default key bindings for the new multiplayer functions. 
  If these keys are not bound to anything else when the patch is installed then 
  they will be bound to the MP functions below.</p>
<ul>
  <li>T-Team Chat</li>
  <li>Y-Chat</li>
  <li>=-Show Scores</li>
  <li>B-Buy Skills</li>
  <li>K-Show Multiplayer Kill Details</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="FindingAGame"></a>Finding 
  a Game</font></b></font></p>
<p>Once you have created a character and bound the multiplayer keys, you are ready 
  to join a game. Make sure you are connected to an internal network or, via modem 
  or broadband connection, to the internet. Select the appropriate connection 
  type on the Player Setup screen. </p>
<p>Back on the Multiplayer menu, select "LAN Game" or "Internet Game," as appropriate. 
  This takes you to the screen that allows you to join or start ("host") a game. 
</p>
<p>If there are games in progress, they will be listed at the top of the screen. 
  Click on one of those games and you get information about how the host has configured 
  his or her session (see "Hosting a Game," below). With a game highlighted, click 
  on the "Join" button and you will enter the game. </p>
<p>If you don't see any game names in the window at the top of the screen, you 
  can create a game of your own by clicking on the "Host" button.</p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="HostingAGame"></a>Hosting 
  a Game</font></b></font></p>
<p>Every multiplayer game requires a PC to act as host. The host machine can also 
  be used by a player in the game. (This is a "non-dedicated server.") The more 
  powerful the host machine is the better overall game performance will be. If 
  you are behind a firewall, make sure that ports 7790, 7791, 7792 and 27900 are 
  allowed through.</p>
<p>When hosting a Deus Ex multiplayer session you can change the following settings 
  to customize the game in a variety of ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Game Type</b> - In DXMP the host can select "Death Match" or "Team Death 
    Match" and can set the difficulty level of the game. "Basic Team Death Match" 
    is generally recommended for new players, since this setting removes skill 
    management from the decisions players have to make and places all skills at 
    Master level. In addition, at the Basic level, players begin with all augmentations 
    they have selected. "Advanced Team Death Match" is a more strategic game for 
    advanced users. At this level, skills and augmentations are gained incrementally 
    during play. Selecting "Custom Team Death Match" allows the host to configure 
    any gameplay settings (see below). In all game types, each time a player is 
    killed, he or she respawns next to a weapon cache -- you never have to worry 
    about entering a game unarmed!<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Map</b> - This determines which map the server loads when a game starts. 
    This can be a map created by the Deus Ex development team specifically for 
    the multiplayer version of the game (dxmp_silo, dxmp_smuggler, dxmp_cathedral, 
    dxmp_cmd, or dxmp_area51bunker) or a map created by a player using the Deus 
    Ex SDK (see "User Created Maps," below).<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Maximum # of Players</b> - This determines how many players can join 
    the game, from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 16.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Friendly Fire</b> - This is a multiplier applied to damage when teammates 
    damage one another. The range is from 0 to 1. As an example of how this setting 
    functions, the default of .5 reduces friendly fire by 50%.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Initial Augmentations</b> - How many of the selected augmentations a 
    player begins with when he or she joins a game or dies and respawns. The range 
    is 0 to 9.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Augmentations Per Kil</b>l - How many of the player's preselected augs 
    are awarded each time an opponent is defeated. The range is 0 to 9. Note that 
    this is a significant change from the single-player game. Instead of getting 
    augmentations by finding and installing augs and upgrades, in multiplayer, 
    you get augmentations automatically (see "Initial Augmentations," above) and 
    by defeating enemies. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Starting Skill Level</b> - How skilled players are when they enter a 
    game or respawn after dying. The host can set this to Trained, Advanced or 
    Master. No one begins a multiplayer game with any skills at the Unskilled 
    level. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Initial Skill Points</b> - How many skill points players have to spend 
    on skills each time they respawn. This can be set anywhere from 0 to 10,000. 
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Skill Points Per Kill</b> - How many skill points players are awarded 
    each time an enemy is defeated. The award can be from 0 to 10,000. Note that, 
    each time your character dies in DXMP, any skills that have been upgraded 
    are reset to the initial starting conditions when you respawn.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Victory Condition</b> - There are two types of victory conditions for 
    the Death Match and Team Death Match games. If the host selects "Time Limit," 
    the game ends when the selected time runs out. At that point whoever has the 
    most kills wins the game. The time limit range is 1 to 20 minutes. Selecting 
    "Kill Limit" ends the game when the first team wins by reaching the selected 
    number. Kill range is 1 to 40. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Map Cycling</b> - Setting this option to "Repeat Map" reloads the map 
    selected under "Map" for a new game each time the game ends. The "Loop Map" 
    option cycles through all installed DXMP maps sequentially. "Random Map" selects 
    randomly from all the available maps each time. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Server Mode</b> - This setting determines whether you want your server 
    to be a Dedicated server or a Non-Dedicated server. On a Non-Dedicated server 
    you can play the game from the host machine. Dedicated servers generally perform 
    better. </li>
</ul>
<p>For additional server performance tweaking, you can edgethe following entries 
  in your DeusEx.ini, in the [IpDrv.TcpNetDriver] block. We've created default 
  values that should work in most situations, but they are available for tweaking:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>StaticUpdateRate</i>: decreasing this value will result in better CPU 
    performance for the server when clients are stationary, but potentially introducing 
    lag for clients.</li>
  <li><i>DynamicUpdateRate</i>: decreasing this value will result in better CPU 
    performance for the server when clients are moving, but potentially introducing 
    lag for clients.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="NamingAServer"></a>Naming 
  a Server</font></b></font></p>
<p>When players try to join a game you are hosting, they see either an IP Address 
  or a server name. If you want players to see a server name, do the following: 
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Open your deusex.ini file in any text editor. </li>
  <li>Find the section that says [Engine.GameReplicationInfo] </li>
  <li>Below that, change the line that has ServerName=&lt;nothing&gt; <nothing> 
    to ServerName=<your servername>&lt;your servername&gt;.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="UserCreatedMaps"></a>User-Created 
  Maps</font></b></font></p>
<p>Five maps are included with Deus Ex Multiplayer. Other maps may become available 
  later, created by the development team or by users with the Deus Ex SDK. </p>
<p>If you wish to add new maps to the list available on the server, do the following: 
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Copy the new map into your Deusex\Maps directory. (Remember: multiplayer 
    maps file names must be prefaced with "dxmp.") </li>
  <li> In DeusEx\System directory, edit your Deusex.Ini file. </li>
  <li> Find the line [DeusEx.DXMapList] </li>
  <li> Below that is a list of maps, of the form "Maps[X]=DXMP_MapName," and "MapSizes[X]=(A-B)." 
    The list of maps available to the server starts at Map[0] and continues until 
    a blank line is reached. So in the default case, the maps go from Maps[0]=DXMP_Cmd 
    to Maps[4]=DXMP_Smuggler. You can add maps to any blank line (or replace existing 
    maps). It is suggested that you also edit the corresponding "MapSizes" line, 
    so that when viewing the maps in the Deus Ex interface, you can see the approximate 
    number of players recommended for the maps.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Interface"></a>Interface</font></b></font></p>
<p>Once you join a game, you'll notice that the interface has changed. Specifically, 
  the Datavault Screens from Deus Ex single-player (inventory, notes, goals, etc.) 
  no longer exist in Deus Ex multiplayer. </p>
<p>In multiplayer you can access all necessary functions from the 3D view and 
  never have to switch screens. </p>
<p>Most of the changes are self-evident but one thing to note: Your inventory 
  is more limited in multiplayer than it is in single-player and the size of objects 
  is no longer a factor in whether or not you can carry something. In DXMP, you 
  can carry only three weapons, three demolitions and four miscellaneous items. 
</p>
<p>The weapons can be any size and type and always appear in the three left-hand 
  slots on your object belt. </p>
<p>The demolitions always appear in the three slots in the center. </p>
<p>The miscellaneous items always appear in the four right-hand slots. You can't 
  rearrange the items in your object belt but, with just ten items available, 
  with dedicated slots for specific object-types and with size being a non-issue, 
  you shouldn't have to. </p>
<p>One other important interface issue to remember: Use your IFF capability. Objects 
  and characters that turn the crosshairs RED are always enemies or enemy owned. 
  Objects or players that show up as GREEN are allies or ally owned. Objects that 
  show up WHITE are neutral.</p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Skills"></a>Skills</font></b></font></p>
<p>Skills work much the way they do in Deus Ex single-player. However, in multiplayer 
  you do not acquire skill points (SP) by solving game problems; instead you acquire 
  skill points by defeating opponents. </p>
<p>When you begin a game or respawn after your character dies, you will be prompted 
  to upgrade your skills. </p>
<p>To acquire or upgrade skills, press the key that you bound to the "Buy Skills" 
  function, as described above. All players begin with the first skill level and 
  two upgrades are possible. Depending on the Host, some game may begin with all 
  skills at the maximum level (making buying skills unnecessary). </p>
<p>Here are the multiplayer specific functions of the available skills. (Note 
  that swimming skill has been eliminated from the list for multiplayer games. 
  This skill's function has been merged with the Aqualung augmentation.)</p>
<p><b>Computer</b><br>
  Upgrading the computer skill reduces the amount of time required to break into 
  a computer security system and take control of cameras and turrets. Unlike single-player 
  Deus Ex, all players can hack in multiplayer but your speed increases with skill 
  level. However, you can only hack enemy-controlled or neutral computers; you 
  can't hack a computer that has already been hacked by an ally.</p>
<p><b>Electronics</b><br>
  This skill reduces the number of multitools required and the amount of time 
  needed to override a keypad lock or bypass a turret (returning it to a neutral 
  state).</p>
<p><b>Environmental Training </b><br>
  This skill increases the duration and effectiveness of the Adaptive Armor, Ballistic 
  Armor and Hazmat Suit. (Note: While this feature is enabled in DXMP, no such 
  suits are placed on any of the levels included with the multiplayer version 
  of the game. It is included here in support of users who wish to include these 
  items in maps of their own creation.)</p>
<p><b>Lockpicking </b><br>
  Upgrading this skill reduces the number of picks required as well as the amount 
  of time needed to pick a non-electronic lock.</p>
<p><b>Medicine</b><br>
  Upgrading the medicine skill makes Medkits more effective in restoring lost 
  health points (HP).</p>
<p><b>Weapons: Demolition</b><br>
  Upgrading this skill grants players greater accuracy and higher damage with 
  demolitions (e.g., LAMs, gas grenades, EMP grenades). If your skill level is 
  higher than the skill level of the player who placed one of these weapons as 
  a proximity trap, you have more time to disarm it before it goes off.</p>
<p><b>Weapons: Heavy</b><br>
  Upgrading this skill grants players greater accuracy, speed and damage with 
  heavy weapons, just as in the single-player game.</p>
<p><b>Weapons: Low-Tech </b><br>
  Upgrading this skill grants players greater accuracy and damage with low-tech 
  weapons, just as in the single-player game.</p>
<p><b>Weapons: Pistol </b><br>
  Upgrading this skill grants players greater accuracy and damage with pistol 
  weapons, just as in the single-player game. </p>
<p><b>Weapons: Rifle </b><br>
  Upgrading this skill grants players greater accuracy and damage with rifle weapons, 
  just as in the single-player game.</p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Augmentations"></a>Augmentations</font></b></font></p>
<p>The Host of each multiplayer game determines how many augmentations players 
  begin the game with and how many are gained upon defeating opponents. </p>
<p>Before joining a match, players can opt to use the default priority for augmentation 
  selections or use the Augmentation screen to select how important each augmentation 
  is to him or to her, individually. Click on the appropriate buttons to select 
  the augmentations you want. </p>
<p>As in the single-player game, each augmentation has an opposite, so player 
  may only pick one. For instance, the Vision augmentation is the paired opposite 
  of the Cloak augmentation. There are 8 pairs of augmentations. The Aqualung 
  augmentation is the only augmentation without an opposing augmentation. (Note: 
  The augmentation oppositions are NOT the same in multiplayer as they are in 
  single-player!) </p>
<p>Once you've constructed your personalized list of augmentations, set your augmentation 
  priorities -- the order in which you'll acquire and upgrade augmentations. Do 
  this by highlighting an augmentation in your list then press the up or down 
  arrow to arrange the list as you wish. </p>
<p>Most augmentations function as they did in Deus Ex single-player but there 
  are a few differences. Multiplayer uses for all augmentations are outlined below. 
</p>
<p><b>Aggressive Defense System </b><br>
  <i>Energy Drain: Low </i><br>
  Enemy rockets detonate before they hit you, doing reduced damage. Large rockets 
  (like the LAW) may detonate close enough to cause considerable damage to your 
  character even if you activate the Aggressive Defense. Agressive Defense does 
  not detonate thrown LAMs, Gas Grenades, or EMP Grenades.</p>
<p><b>Aqualung </b><br>
  <i>Energy Drain: Low </i><br>
  Allows you to stay underwater 12 times longer than normal. This also doubles 
  the player's swimming speed.</p>
<p><b>Ballistic Protection </b><br>
  <i>Energy Drain: High </i><br>
  Reduces the effectiveness of melee weapons and ballistic weapons (e.g., rifles 
  and pistols) by 40%.</p>
<p><b>Cloak </b><br>
  <i>Energy Drain: Moderate </i><br>
  Makes you invisible to enemy players. Electronic devices and players with the 
  Vision Enhancement augmentation can detect you. Upon drawing a weapon you uncloak 
  and become visible to all. In Team Death Match players who are cloaked are still 
  visible to their allies.</p>
<p><b>Combat Strength </b><br>
  <i>Energy Drain: Low </i><br>
  You do double damage with melee weapons (e.g., combat knife).</p>
<p><b>EMP Shield </b><br>
  <i>Energy Drain: Very Low </i><br>
  Reduces the effectiveness of EMP attacks against you by 95%.</p>
<p><b>Energy Shield </b><br>
  <i>Energy Drain: Moderate </i><br>
  Reduces the effectiveness of attacks from the plasma gun and flamethrower by 
  80%. </p>
<p><b>Environmental Resistance <br>
  </b><i>Energy Drain: Low </i><br>
  Reduces damage from poison and gas by 90% and eliminates poison and gas vision 
  reduction entirely. Note that turning on this aug after you already have vision 
  problems will not remove the vision effect.</p>
<p><b>Microfibral Muscle </b><br>
  <i>Energy Drain: Low </i><br>
  Allows you to pick up large crates.</p>
<p><b>Power Recirculator </b><br>
  <i>Energy Drain: None </i><br>
  Reduces the energy drain of other augmentations. Note that the Power Recirculator 
  is automatically activated when any other augmentations are activated.</p>
<p><b>Radar Transparency </b><br>
  <i>Energy Drain: Very Low </i><br>
  Makes you invisible to electronic devices such as cameras, turrets and proximity 
  mines (e.g., LAMs).</p>
<p><b>Run Silent </b><br>
  <i>Energy Drain: Low </i><br>
  You move completely silently regardless of speed.</p>
<p><b>Speed Enhancement </b><br>
  <i>Energy Drain: Very High </i><br>
  Allows you to move twice as fast and jump twice as high.</p>
<p><b>Spy Drone </b><br>
  <i>Energy Drain: Moderate </i><br>
  Creates a small, remote-controlled drone. Pressing the firing key (or mouse 
  button) while the drone is active delivers powerful EMP damage to any player 
  or electronic device in the vicinity of the drone. </p>
<p><b>Targeting </b><br>
  <i>Energy Drain: Moderate </i><br>
  You do 40% more damage with all weapons. You can also see an enemy's health. 
</p>
<p><b>Vision Enhancement </b><br>
  <i>Energy Drain: Moderate </i><br>
  Allows you to see enemy players in the dark from any distance. For a short distance 
  you can see through walls and see cloaked enemies. Enemy players appear in red.</p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="ToolsAndItems"></a>Tools 
  and Items</font></b></font></p>
<p>Most tools and items in Deus Ex multiplayer function as they do in the single-player 
  game. <i>Differences</i> are noted below.</p>
<p><b>BioElectric Cells </b><br>
  Restore 50 points of BioElectric energy. </p>
<p><b>Corpses </b><br>
  Searching a fallen character -- enemy or ally -- recharges your BioElectric 
  energy by 25 points. </p>
<p><b>Lockpicks </b><br>
  Lockpicks can be used to unlock resource cabinets and locked doors. </p>
<p><b>Medbots </b><br>
  Completely restore your character's health. Medbots require 30 seconds to recharge 
  after each use. Medkits Counter the effects of poison and fire. </p>
<p><b>Multitools </b><br>
  Used to hack keypads which open Repairbot storage areas and small equipment 
  caches. Multitools can also be used to change the allegiance of turrets (see 
  "Turrets," below). </p>
<p><b>Repairbots </b><br>
  Fully charge your character's BioElectric energy. Repairbots require 30 seconds 
  to recharge after each use. Note that, in the provided multiplayer maps, repairbots 
  are always found in compartments that must be opened by hacking a keypad. </p>
<p><b>Turrets </b><br>
  In multiplayer, turrets are indestructible, regardless of what weapon you're 
  using or your skill level with it. However, they can be temporarily disabled 
  by EMP attacks. EMP attacks completely disable a turret for 10 to 30 seconds. 
  Turrets can also be affected by multitools. Multitooling a turret will set it 
  to a "bypassed" or dormant state. In addition a computer that controls a turret 
  can be hacked to change the alliance of that turret. Turrets controlled by your 
  team attack enemies that come within range but do not attack you or your allies. 
</p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Weapons"></a>Weapons</font></b></font> 
</p>
<p>Ammunition for a weapon is automatically gathered when you pick it up. To replenish 
  your ammo, simply find and pick up another weapon of the same type, or activate 
  a large ammo crate (which restocks all weapons in your inventory). There are 
  additional ammo types that may be found individually, such as WP rockets or 
  20mm.</p>
<p><b>Assault Rifle</b><br>
  <i>Skill - Weapons: Rifle </i><br>
  Automatic weapon with good damage at medium and short range. </p>
<p><b>Assault Shotgun </b><br>
  <i>Skill - Weapons: Rifle </i><br>
  Automatic shotgun with excellent damage at short range and good damage at medium 
  range. </p>
<p><b>SawedOff Shotgun </b><br>
  <i>Skill - Weapons: Rifle </i><br>
  Very powerful at extremely short ranges. </p>
<p><b>Sniper Rifle </b><br>
  <i>Skill - Weapons: Rifle </i><br>
  The sniper rifle does excellent damage at long range, especially when its telescopic 
  sight is active. At short range its effectiveness is greatly reduced. </p>
<p><b>Flame Thrower</b> <br>
  <i>Skill - Weapons: Heavy</i> <br>
  Burns victims at very close range. Anyone damaged by this weapon catches on 
  fire and continues to take damage for 15 seconds, until they die or until the 
  flame is extinguished. The flame can be extinguished by using a Medbot, using 
  a Medkit or by jumping into water. </p>
<p><b>GEP Gun</b> <br>
  <i>Skill - Weapons: Heavy </i><br>
  Fires small rockets. When a target is acquired and locked the missile tracks 
  that target. This weapon is equipped with a very effective telescopic sight. 
  Note that you will not turn as rapidly with this guy equipped. </p>
<p><b>LAW</b> <br>
  <i>Skill - Weapons: Heavy </i><br>
  One-shot, fire-and-throwaway long range rocket. Most powerful damage blast in 
  the game. </p>
<p><b>Plasma Gun </b><br>
  <i>Skill - Weapons: Heavy</i> <br>
  Fires a burst of plasma, doing splash damage. Especially good for suppression 
  fire at long and medium ranges. </p>
<p><b>Crossbow </b><br>
  <i>Skill - Weapons: Pistol </i><br>
  Fires poison darts at short and medium range. The poison does continuous damage 
  and obscures the victim's vision for 15 seconds, until the victim dies or until 
  the poison is neutralized. To neutralize poison, use a medkit or a medbot. </p>
<p><b>Pistol </b><br>
  <i>Skill - Weapons: Pistol </i><br>
  Good for close and medium range. </p>
<p><b>Stealth Pistol </b><br>
  <i>Skill - Weapons: Pistol</i> <br>
  Less damage than the Pistol but faster rate of fire and far quieter. </p>
<p><b>Combat Knife </b><br>
  <i>Skill - Weapons: Low-Tech</i> <br>
  Extremely short range, moderate damage weapon. </p>
<p><b>DragonTooth Sword </b><br>
  <i>Skill - Weapons: Low-Tech</i> <br>
  Most powerful LowTech weapon but short range and noisy. Note difference from 
  single player: The sword now has a longer range, and attacks over a small area 
  within the swing arc, rather than hitting one single point.</p>
<p> <b>Throwing Knives</b> <br>
  <i>Skill - Weapons: Low-Tech</i> <br>
  Totally silent, short and medium range attack for moderate damage with a very 
  fast rate of fire. </p>
<p><b>EMP Grenade </b><br>
  <i>Skill - Weapons: Demolition</i><br>
  EMP attacks drain most or all of your BioElectric energy, depending on your 
  proximity to the point of impact. EMP grenades set as proximity mines do not 
  detonate when allies are in range -- they detonate only when enemies are in 
  range. You can't take EMP Grenades placed by allies as proximity traps. </p>
<p><b>Gas Grenade </b><br>
  <i>Skill - Weapons: Demolition </i><br>
  Gas Grenades inflict poison damage. They also obscure vision while you're within 
  the clouds and for 15 seconds after you leave the clouds. You can nullify the 
  effects of gas by activating the Environmental Resistance augmentation or by 
  using a medkit or medbot. Gas grenades set as proximity mines do not detonate 
  when allies are in range -- they are detonated only by enemies. You can't take 
  Gas Grenades placed by allies as proximity traps. </p>
<p><b>LAM Grenade </b><br>
  <i>Skill - Weapons: Demolition </i><br>
  As in Deus Ex single-player, LAMs can be tossed like grenades or set as proximity 
  mine. LAMs set as proximity mines do not detonate when allies are in range -- 
  they detonate only when enemies are in range. You can't take LAMs placed by 
  allies as proximity traps. </p>
