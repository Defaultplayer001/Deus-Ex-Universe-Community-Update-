<br>
Thank you for installing the Deus Ex demo. This demo features 1 full mission and the training mission, taken from the retail version of game.  The full game features:<br>
<br>
<UL><LI>The best elements of role-playing, action, adventure, and 1st person shooter genres combined in a chaotic blend of real world conspiracies, cliffhangers and plot twists.<br>
<LI>A richly simulated world of unparalleled interactivity, engineered to react logically to your every action. The decisions and consequences are yours.<br>
<LI> A globe-hopping, epic adventure.  Travel the world from New York to Paris to Hong Kong exploring locations recreated from detailed maps, blueprints and photographs.<br>
<LI>Character interaction that matters.  How you choose to deal with scores of NPC's affects the outcome of the game, minute-to-minute, mission to mission, and start to finish.<br>
<LI> The ability to create a compelling alter ego.  Select and develop your own unique set of skills and nanotech augmentations; determine which weapons and objects you need to survive and solve problems. Will you be the charismatic master manipulator, the shrewd and stealthy tactician, or the deadly avenging angel?<br>
</ul>

 The first time the game is run, the <B>Deus Ex Video Configuration</B> screen appears. This screen also appears if you decide to change the <B>rendering device</B> from within the game. <br>
 <br>
 <B>To run Deus Ex you must have a 3D accelerator card installed.</B> We officially support the following two video drivers:<br>
 <br>
 	<B>3Dfx Glide for Windows<br>
 	Direct3D Support<br>
 <br>
 </B>If you wish to run the game on a 3Dfx-based card, select <B>3Dfx Glide for Windows</B>. For all other 3D cards, select <B> Direct3D Support</B>. If you decide to run in any of the other graphic modes, the game may run very slowly or may not run at all. <br>
 <br>
 <B>If you experience any problems running Deus Ex, please update your graphic card drivers. </B><I>Deus Ex</I> was tested with the latest graphic card drivers available.<br>
 <br>
 These graphic modes are available but are <B>not supported</B>:<br>
 <br>
 	<B>Software Rendering<br>
 	OpenGL<br>
 	S3 Metal</B><br>
 <br>
 We do not recommend running the game in any non-supported modes.

 </FONT><FONT color="#000000" face="Arial"><B>Matrox G200<br></B></FONT>
Running the game in 32-bit color mode is not recommended with this chipset.<br>
<br>

<FONT face="Arial"><B>3Dfx Voodoo 1<br></B></FONT>
This chip only supports 640x480 in 16-bit color. We recommend that you set all detail settings to low.<br>
<br>

 <FONT face="Arial"><B>3Dfx Voodoo 2<br></B></FONT>
The Voodoo 2 only supports 640x480 and 800x600 resolutions, in 16-bit color. You will be able to run <I>Deus Ex</I> at 1024x768 with 2 Voodoo 2 cards in SLI mode.<br>
<br>

<FONT color="#000000" face="Arial"><B>Intel 810<br></B></FONT>
Running the game in 32-bit color is not recommended.<br>
<br>

 <FONT color="#000000" face="Arial"><B>Savage 4, Diamond S540<br></B></FONT>
Setting the UI/Menu Background to <I>Snapshot</I> will result in some graphic corruption, we recommend that you use the Render 3D or Black setting.<br>
<br>

 <FONT color="#000000" face="Arial"><B>Direct3D cards<br></B></FONT>
On some of the cards that support Direct3D, there are minor sorting issues on signs, computer terminals and objects seen at long range. If you switch the Texture Color Depth setting (found under Display, in Game Options) to 32-bit color, the sorting issues will disappear. As an alternative, some cards can be forced to use a 24-bit or 32-bit z-buffer from the Windows control panel display settings. Consult your video card documentation for details on this alternate procedure.<br>
 <br>

 <FONT color="#0000FF" face="Arial"><B><a name="display"></a>Display Settings<br></B></FONT>
 <I>Deus Ex</I> allows you to change a large number of graphic options in order to achieve the best performance while running on your hardware. If the game is running slowly on your system, there are a number of Game and Display options you can change to help optimize the performance of the game. The Display settings can be found by selecting Game Options, and clicking on Display. <br>
 <br>
 The settings listed below will make the biggest difference in performance, especially World Texture Detail, Screen Resolution and Texture Color Depth. For a list of all of the Game Options and Display Settings available, please consult the game manual.<br>
 <br>
 <B>Adjust Brightness</B> &#150; If you find the game to be a little too dark or too bright, you can change the overall brightness by selecting this option and moving the slider.<br>
 <br>
 <B>Toggle Full-Screen Mode</B> &#150; You can toggle between a window and full screen with this setting. We recommend that you run <I>Deus Ex</I> in full screen mode at all times. (It looks a lot better that way.)<br>
 <br>
 <B>Rendering Device</B> &#150; You can change the 3D graphics mode by selecting this option. The game will exit and restart, bringing up the Video Configuration screen (see the Video Configuration section in this document). Make sure you save your game before changing your rendering device, or you will lose your current progress. The only modes that are officially supported are <B>3Dfx Glide for Windows, </B>and <B>Direct3D Support</B>. If you are running in any other mode<B>, we highly recommend that you switch to one of the supported modes.<br>
 </B><br>
 <B>Screen Resolution</B> &#150; If you lower the screen resolution within the game, you will probably get a better frame rate. If the game is running slowly on your system, try lowering the screen resolution for better results.<br>
 <br>
 <B>Texture Color Depth</B> &#150; The game will run fastest in 16-bit color mode. Not all 3D cards support 32-bit color. In order for a Texture Color Depth change to take effect, quit out of the game to the desktop and restart the game.<br>
 <br>
 <B>NOTE:</B> You can't change Texture Color Depth and screen resolution at the same time. Set screen resolution first, click Okay and then return to the Display Settings screen to change texture color depth.<br>
 <br>
 <B>World Texture Detail/Object Texture Detail</B> &#150; Setting the Detail Levels to LOW will help increase performance on some cards. However, textures will appear blurry.<br>
 <br>
 <hr>




 <FONT color="#0000FF" face="Arial"><B><a name="sound"></a>Sound Settings<br></B></FONT>
 <B>Effects Channels</B> &#150; If you reduce the number of effects channels, you may get an increase in performance.<br>
 <br>
 <I>Deus Ex</I> offers some advanced options that are supported by the latest and greatest sound cards:<br>
 <br>
 <B>Dolby Surround Sound </B>&#150; To turn on the Dolby Surround Sound setting, you must have a stereo sound card and your computer must be hooked up to a Dolby Pro Logic Surround Sound-capable receiver. <br>
 <br>
 <B>Hardware 3D Support - </B>If your sound card supports 3D and environmental sound (such as EAX and A3D compatible sound cards), you can enable Hardware 3D Support for a highly immersive experience. However, if your card does not support hardware acceleration, 3D and environmental sound, you may not get any sound at all with Hardware 3D Support turned on. If this happens, just go back to the Audio Options and turn Hardware 3D Support <B>off</B>.<br>
 <br>
 <B>NOTE:</B> If you change this option, you will need to exit the game back to the desktop and restart for these changes to take effect.<br>
 <br>
If you are experiencing sound problems such as sound skipping or stuttering, please update your sound card drivers.<br>
<br>
For information about all of the Audio Settings, refer to your game manual.<br>

 <FONT face="Arial" color="#0000FF" ><B><a name="tips"></a>Additional Performance Tips<br>
 </B></FONT>
 While <I>Deus Ex</I> will run fine with 64 MB of RAM, your playing experience will be smoother if you have at least 128 MB of RAM. Regardless of how much memory you have, you can maximize your available memory and increase the overall performance of the game engine by doing the following:<br>
 <br>
 
<UL><LI>Closing any open windows<br>
 <LI>Shutting down all other programs, including menu-bar programs like ICQ<br>
 <LI>Defragmenting your hard drive<br>
 <LI>Making sure you have additional free space on your hard drive.<br>
