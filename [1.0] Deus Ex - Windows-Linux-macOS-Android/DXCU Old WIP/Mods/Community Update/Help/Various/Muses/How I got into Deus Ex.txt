This is a reply to a user on Reddit who asked "-how did you get into Deus Ex?" 

They deleted their account overnight before I could reply. They seem to have joined the DXCHQ discord, but have also deleted their account there. 

No idea why.

Might be self indulgent, but I thought I'd at least share it elsewhere. Maybe someone will find it interesting.

At the very least I want to be sure I remember!

Sure, I don't mind! Sorry for the long post, I got into the habit of speaking as if on record. In archiving stuff I've noticed how useful / interesting it is when past users are thorough.
 
IIRC, I played it after Thief 1-2 when I was probably 12-13, about ten years ago.
 
I was looking for a similar game, found Deus Ex, then moved onto the Elder Scrolls series when I saw my brother playing Oblivion and realized how similar they were.
 
At least that's how I think it happened, memory is unreliable so it could have been that general sequence of events in any order.
 
I had older PCs so was only able to play relatively older games like those (though they could only barely run Oblivion).
 
Though I liked Thief and Oblivion very much, Deus Ex left a special impression on me. Paul Denton specifically has always reminded me of my older brother (It helps that we're twins and technically clones too).
 
I've loved it since then, but wasn't really active in the community until a couple years ago.
 
In fact, I found my first post: http://www.offtopicproductions.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=12174&hilit=risky+click&start=285
 
A bit embarrassed about this in hindsight, both because Totalitarian turned out be be rather toxic, and the dick joke was probably unnecessary.
 
I had gotten active into modding a game called "Sub Rosa".(https://store.steampowered.com/app/272230/Sub_Rosa/, though it was very different at the time)
 
The developer had unfortunately made it clear modding wasn't going to be supported.  I had actually spent months with another user trying to get a debug editor working, which we eventually did!

Unfortunately, the game was updated soon after; and we lost relevance & momentum. As can be seen by the incomplete nature of the guide still.
 
Frustrated by this, I eventually decided I wanted to move to a game I was passionate about with more mod support.
 
Deus Ex was the clear answer, I also considered The Elder Scrolls games strongly as well.
 
Gotta root for the underdog though, so I went with Deus Ex!
 
Been doin a bunch of stuff since then, probably most notably the DXArchive with my good friend Xen, and Confix. Also been working on a general community update for a while.
