Deus Exe is a replacement executable for Deus Ex. It's compatible with the GOTY edition of the game, which includes the Steam version. 
It fixes various issues running on modern computers, helps you configure the game, and includes a mod manager.

Deus Exe requires Windows Vista or later since version 6. The last version with Windows XP support is v5.3. Download: DeusExe-v5.3.zip.

Deus Exe requires that your game version is 1.112fm, if you have an original non-GOTY version, install the 1.112fm patch. Download: DeusExMPPatch1112fm.exe.

Unfortunately, Deus Exe is NOT compatible with the Direct2Drive version of the game. My apologies, I can't do anything about this.
