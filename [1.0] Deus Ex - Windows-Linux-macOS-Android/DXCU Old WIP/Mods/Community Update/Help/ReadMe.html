<p>Hanfling of Revision has created <em>many</em> projects invaluable to the Deus Ex community!
You can support their work directly and the community update indirectly through their patreon. </p>
<p>This patch wouldn&#39;t exist without them, Revision, and numerous community members.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone! </p>

<h3 id="what-this-is-">What this is:</h3>
<p>Just Deus Ex - ready to play! </p>
<p>With all 11 known text translations, along with many extras for editing. </p>
<p>Specifically has numerous community made engine level fixes on top of the proper 1112fm (GOTY) patch, without the broken maps shipped on retail versions. 
Actual gameplay code is identical, warts and all! </p>
<p>Also includes a dedicated multiplayer setup, plus the original 2 mission demo updated to the latest version.</p>
<p>Features the new Lay D Denton Project as an install option, a female JC Denton player mod! </p>
<p>Selected by default is the fantastic mod: </p>
<h4 id="deus-ex-transcended">Deus Ex: Transcended</h4>
<p>As described by it&#39;s creator: 
Built largely for first timer players, Deus Ex: Transcended is a mod focused solely around faithfulness to the original, while bringing an unmatched arsenal of bug fixes, paired with key notes of Quality of Life changes.</p>
<p>Sticklers may still wish to play the game how it was originally made - so the option to easily deselect this is available. </p>
<p>However as a stickler myself, <em>it&#39;s worth it</em>.</p>
<p>Warning: Vanilla and Transcended saves are not compatible with each other!</p>
<p>Also selected by default is &quot;Confix&quot;, a conversation typo and logic patch.</p>

<p>Simply install and run from the created &quot;Play Deus Ex&quot; shortcut in your Start menu under the Deus Ex Community Update Folder.</p>
<p>This was tested on the 1112fm disc/Steam/GOG versions, but should work on every copy of Deus Ex available, if it doesn&#39;t please let us know! (Make sure however you use a fresh copy for guaranteed intended functionality, as many mods like to overwrite core files.)</p>
<p>Note: For some currently unknown reasoon on German copies of Windows past versions of the installer crash, possibly current ones as well. If you encounter any issues rename the .exe to a .7z, extract and follow the instructions in the ReadMe.</p>

<h3 id="about-">About:</h3>
<p>This is an unofficial patch package assembled by the Deus Ex community and Xen&#39;s Deus Ex Archive: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dxarchive/">https://www.reddit.com/r/dxarchive/</a></p>
<p>DXCHQ Discord (DXA / DXCU channels): <a href="https://discord.gg/75UpZhy">https://discord.gg/75UpZhy</a></p>
<p>Everyone has their own vision of how Deus Ex should be, and while we can&#39;t promise to fulfill everyone, we hope to cover as many user scenarios as possible! </p>
<h3 id="known-issues-">Known issues:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You may need to alt-tab out and back into the game on boot. At least with DX9 on some systems it displays only black at first. Likewise, sometimes the initial launch menu doesn&#39;t appear up front.</li>
<li>On modern systems, it&#39;s possible the first line of the intro gets cuts off. If you load into a map (even the intro itself), then play the into the line plays as intended.</li>
<li>Both of the above also happen with a vanilla install as well. Not DXCU related. Both also have currently unknown causes. </li>
<li>With Transcended couches / chairs may be different colors from the original &quot;Model T Black&quot; single color aesthetic. Makes some locations such as Paul&#39;s apartment look different from their Vanilla designs. Arguably a bug fix but unfortunately the other furniture color textures noticeably look worse and also just throw off the original aesthetic. Also also nostalgia. Will be changed as soon as I figure out the class replacement that Han told me about or how to recompile DXT&#39;s DeusEx.u. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-is-this-so-big-">Why is this so big?</h3>
<p>A 700mb installer certainly isn&#39;t ideal for a Deus Ex mod. Options such as delta compression have been looked into, but with unsatisfactory results so far.
If anyone has any suggestions for cutting the file size down, let us know! </p>
<p>Here&#39;s the current breakdown (Sizes approximate):</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h4 id="total-690mb-english-russian-dxt-confix-install-1-6gb-everything-source-">Total: 690mb* (English / Russian DXT+Confix Install) / 1.6gb (Everything / Source)</h4>

</ul>
<h3 id="can-i-just-use-the-transcended-standalone-installer-confix-if-i-m-playing-in-english-and-want-to-use-dxt-">Can I just use the Transcended standalone installer + Confix if I&#39;m playing in English and want to use DXT?</h3>
<p>Pretty much, yeah!</p>
<p>CU has some specific compatibility patches for using DXT with other translations, but it was developed in English so no issue there ofc.</p>
<p>Using this is arguably more convienent if you don&#39;t care so much about file size, since it already includes Confix - 
But if you don&#39;t care about that then yeah, exact same thing aside from the noted minor .ini customizations. 
They use all the same core engine fixes, same installer too. </p>
<p>There&#39;s also the extra renderers / editing tools / demo and multiplayer, but again if you don&#39;t care about those then yeah, using just DXT + Confix will work for you!</p>

<p>This patch for me is the culmination of years researching the Deus Ex franchise, and a lifetime of being a fan. </p>
<p>Like JC, I have a clone AKA twin. I remember falling in love with the game because of Paul, specifically the famous &#39;Ton raid. The way he cared and protected JC always reminds me of the way my own sibling has for me. </p>
<p>It&#39;s my hope with this, others might continue to experience that for years to come. </p>
<p>Love you bro.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll get you interested in playing this eventually! </p>
