Custom Player Class (Allows simple custom player class without convos with choices failing.):

hexediting consys.dll would be another option
[8:19 PM]
but you prob just can use shorter or equal lenght names
[8:21 PM]
at best a few chars more due to padding in the binary
[8:21 PM]
and you only need to use the hexedited consys.dll when importing the convo
[8:21 PM]
i mean literally, open consys.dll in xvi32
[8:21 PM]
search for JCDenton
[8:21 PM]
replace it, 0 terminate if name is shorter
[8:22 PM]
should be 1-2 occurances i guess
[8:22 PM]
probably the easiest solution
[8:23 PM]
you could even use a script + hexed to make it more flexible with custom pc name
