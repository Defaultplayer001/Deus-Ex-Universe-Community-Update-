I just found a workaround to accidentally working in stupid copy protected mode, and also easily copying stuff from one .con file to another!
Finally!
So simple in hindsight.
Just copy what you want, open the new .con file, and then paste!
I bet others knew about this but I sure didn't.
Hm, annoyingly you can't seem to paste sections from one characters convo into anothers easily.
That being said aside that limitation the trick still works!
You can copy a characters convo section, reload the unchanged file, then paste and it will work!
If the NPC does not exist it seems to create it.
Unfortunately no way to select multiple convo sections of a character, so no good way to copy entire characters it seems.
