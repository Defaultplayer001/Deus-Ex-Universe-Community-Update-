Chosen camera angles do not reliably work over the course of a convo. 

Will occasionally for whatever reason be completely random.

I tried, I mean I really tried to find even a crappy hacky work around for this over the course of like 3 days.

Tried finding a pattern to the Randomness, tried Restructuring the convos into parts, with convos on the top, with convos in their own Camera group - 
I tried even Rebuilding the whole con file. 

Cemera angles are as far as I can tell pretty much immediatly unreliable. 

Specifically the one i was testing was Below, looking up. 

Got it to work OCCASIONALLY in super small convos, or at the last group in a restructured one.

Idk why, couldn't repeat them. 

My last R is Running away, and I'm using it.
