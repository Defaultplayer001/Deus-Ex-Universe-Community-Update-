I think conversation files have to be in the same directory as the exe

actually not necessarily, but but rather relative to the exe as ..\System\<thing>
that is so unnecessary and annoying

It's just the con files that annoyingly have to be in a /system folder relative to the EXE, right?
At least my brief tests seem to confirm that.
Launches at least.

yeah
or actually just the con audio files i think

UPDATE: 

;Confix Path
Paths=..\..\Confix\System\*.u

This does indeed seem to work fine?
nah — Today at 4:40 PM
does confix update the audio packages?

Defaultmom001 — Today at 4:40 PM
Yup
I just tested
If it's named anything but system
it fails
get the classic mismatched audio
but if it's named system, works fine.

ah
Defaultmom001 — Today at 4:41 PM
;Confix Path
Paths=..\..\Confix\Convos\*.u
=no good
So at least I'm not going crazy
happy accident that I found out this works
