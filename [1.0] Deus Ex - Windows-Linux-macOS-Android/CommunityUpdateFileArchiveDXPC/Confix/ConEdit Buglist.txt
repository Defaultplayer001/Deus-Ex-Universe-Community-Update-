"Run-time error '457' This key is already associated with an element of this collection"
If you try to edit a previously made choice, you get that bug, even it was copied like in my case.
If you create a new choice though, it works!

This is apparently actually a DEED bug according to Han! 
"DConChoice::Import skips over 4 bytes on import" 

Another DEED bug. Sometimes the DEED decompile / recompile process will break convos! As is the case with the NSFTroop convo in the Mission51.con file for Invisible War (Revised)!
