All multiple choice item gives should be moved to a + mode and vanilla functionality restored by default. 


BJORN:			ClinicMaleBum1.ClinicMaleBum1Overhead + ClinicMaleBum2.ClinicMaleBum2Squalnomie + ClinicMaleBum2.ClinicMaleBum2Military - Fix flags and logic
Why: This seems to have been perhaps edited to fix non-working player convos? Specifically these: ClinicMaleBum2.ClinicMaleBum2Squalnomie + ClinicMaleBum2.ClinicMaleBum2Military. 
Can't figure out exactly what broke though or how it was fixed, I know I don't recall being able to trigger the convos with the player in the PS2 version.
More testing needed.
All I know for sure is that the vanilla version is entirely random and repeating, whereas the "fixed" version is sequential and only the last repeats. 
I actually prefer the fixed version aside from the last line repeating; but it's def not vanilla and should be reserved for the + patch, shouldn't it?
