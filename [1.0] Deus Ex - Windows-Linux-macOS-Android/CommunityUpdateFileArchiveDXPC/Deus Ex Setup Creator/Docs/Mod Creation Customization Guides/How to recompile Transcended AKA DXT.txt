Dumbass checklist (Talkin' to you, me): 

1. Make sure all Transcended packages are loaded *before* DeusEx

	This works:
		EditPackages=TranscendedModels
		EditPackages=TranscendedTextures
		EditPackages=TranscendedUI
		EditPackages=DeusEx

	This fails with missing textures errors:
		EditPackages=TranscendedModels
		EditPackages=TranscendedTextures
		EditPackages=DeusEx
		EditPackages=TranscendedUI

	This fails with NO errors:
		EditPackages=TranscendedTextures
		EditPackages=TranscendedUI
		EditPackages=DeusEx
		EditPackages=TranscendedModels

2. It won't load just a UTX apparently, you gotta rename it to .u

	Trying to load the normal "Transcended.utx" fails with missing texture errors
	Loading "Transcended.u" succeeds. 
	The standard .utx works as expected when compiled.


Error: H:\Deus Ex - The Exorcism\Mods\Community Update\DeusEx\Classes\PersonaScrollAreaWindow.uc(65) : Error, Can't find Texture 'PersonaScrollHThumb_Bottom'

Ugh yeah

No matter what i do it still complains of missing textures that I've spammed everywhere yet it still can't find

Is TranscendedUI in editpackages

Mhm just double checked that a few mins ago
tried loading it by directly specifying stuff like DeusEx.texturename DeusEx.Userinterface.Texturename, changing the name to crap like "test", ect
