Best method:

1. Export to .t3d with UED (File-Export Level)

2. Open exported .t3d in text editor

3. Search for package name

4. Use that as a guide as what to delete in UED for the original map. (Ctrl-F can be used with EditorPatch to find things more quickly.)

4 (Alternative). Delete problematic actor blocks in .t3d file with a text editor directly, then import into UED.

Simple method:

1. Drop down all items within a package (Or as a quick first step for large packages, the suspected problem item(s))

2. Right click and select all

3. Delete
