This collection contains fixes for many things, but none for the heart.

When you're feeling low or demotivated, hopefully these can help! 


Feel free to ask to submit stuff! 

Try to keep this folder to less then 10mb, items are not meant to be archival quality. Hard limit of 50mb. 
Compress as much as possible! 

Also, I think it's personally funner to be mysterious and vague about why an item is here. 
Make anybody looking at it think for a sec, ask why that is.
