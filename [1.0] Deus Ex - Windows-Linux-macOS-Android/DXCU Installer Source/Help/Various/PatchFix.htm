<h4 align="center"> March 16, 2001<br>
  Version 1.1</h4>
<hr>
<p><b>In version 1.112fm:</b></p>
<p><b>Bugs:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Blocked some cheats related to overriding the local console or root window.</li>
  <li>Doors opened by buttons in multiplayer work properly now. </li>
  <li>Opening a door in multiplayer automatically unlocks it, whether opened by 
    button or by lockpicking. </li>
  <li>Fixed some potential problems with locked double doors in multiplayer. </li>
  <li>Disabling screenflashes no longer has an effect on multiplayer. Multiplayer 
    always has screenflashes on. </li>
  <li>The server information window in the join game screen now indicates whether 
    or not a server is password protected. </li>
  <li>Mousewheel support for remote clients has been fixed to be consistent with 
    mousewheel use for the singleplayer game. </li>
  <li>If a server is listed as full on the join game screen, you cannot join it. 
    If you refresh the list and the server is no longer listed as full, you can 
    then join. </li>
  <li>The viewplayer command no longer works in multiplayer games. Mod makers 
    can change this by overriding the CanSpectate function. </li>
  <li>Looting corpses while carrying no weapons no longer gives you increased 
    ammo counts. </li>
  <li>The flamethrower was generating log warning messages under certain circumstances. 
    Those have been fixed. </li>
  <li>Dropping a weapon and then picking it up caused its ammo count to get messed 
    up, causing problems when you tried to restock it with an ammo crate. This 
    has been fixed. </li>
  <li>LAMs become disabled when the person who placed them leaves the game. </li>
  <li>You can no longer lean on other players to kill them. </li>
  <li>Leaning occasionally caused people to rotate wierdly. This has been fixed. 
  </li>
  <li>Under certain circumstances, the vision augmentation could be broken until 
    you died and respawned. This has been fixed. </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><b>Bugs:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li> All locked doors in multiplayer should close properly now and will not 
    get stuck open. </li>
  <li> Keypads and locked doors lock after 28 seconds instead of 30 seconds. This 
    prevents people from looting the same cabinet twice for one pick attempt. 
  </li>
  <li> Singleplayer energy shield was only blocking 70% damage at max level instead 
    of the 80% of the original singleplayer game. It has been put back to 80%. 
  </li>
  <li>If you hit the buy skills key in a singleplayer game, the belt will no longer 
    dim. </li>
  <li>Grenade placement animation works correctly now. </li>
  <li>Grenades can no longer be placed on selectable objects (computers, weapons 
    on the weapon rack). This includes doors. This prevents players from hiding 
    grenades behind computers, GEP guns, etc. </li>
  <li>At very low framerates(for the server or singleplayer), lockpicking and 
    multitooling took longer than they should. This has been fixed. </li>
  <li>Pings now sort correctly on the join game screen. </li>
  <li>In multiplayer, when coming out of water, clients occasionally did not get 
    their eye heights adjusted properly, and would appear (to themselves) to be 
    crouched. This has been fixed. </li>
  <li>Elevator buttons should stay in better sync now. </li>
  <li>Next item/ Previous item commands (by default bound to the mousewheel) should 
    work better in multiplayer.</li>
  <li>The inventory screen can no longer be activated at the end of a match. </li>
  <li>The player death sequence should no longer occasionally freeze in singleplayer. 
  </li>
  <li>The multiplayer scoreboard only highlights your player in gold, even if 
    other players have the same name. </li>
  <li>You can no longer exploit the regeneration augmentation by toggling it on 
    and off very quickly (resulting in almost instant healing for almost no cost). 
  </li>
  <li>Fixed a situation in which cloaked people were occasionally slightly visible 
    just after coming into the room or around a corner. </li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in multiplayer in which you could turn 2 biocells, lockpicks, 
    medkits, grenades, or multitools into a lot by clicking very quickly. </li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in singleplayer in which corpses occasionally became placeholder 
    boxes (garish boxes bearing the legend "Do not place"). </li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in which firing a rapid-fire weapon immediately after drawing 
    it could get the weapon stuck in a bad state. </li>
  <li>Repair bots should no longer be accessible through closed repairbot bay 
    doors in multiplayer. </li>
  <li>The listen client player will not bleed from the previous deathblow after 
    respawn.</li>
  <li>In a DeathMatchGame, if there is a winning tie at all, the match will be 
    called a draw. </li>
  <li>A certain class of cheats was available by using alternate root windows. 
    The standard deathmatch and team deathmatch games now kick players who are 
    using a different root window, and support has been added for mod teams to 
    insist on their own windows. </li>
  <li>Text files can now be read in from packages other than deusextext.u. This 
    affects class Computers (emails/bulletins) and class InformationDevices(datacubes, 
    books, etc). A new property "TextPackage" specifies the package from which 
    the text comes.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Balancing/Features:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Targeting augmentation now displays hit location at which you are aiming 
    (head/torso/leg). </li>
  <li>Throwing knife does 17 base damage instead of 25. </li>
  <li>Plasma does 8 base damage instead of 12. </li>
  <li>Energy shield blocks 50% of damage instead of 80%. Drains 25 energy per 
    minute instead of 40. </li>
  <li>You can now chat while dead, while at the end of a match, or while logged 
    into a computer. </li>
  <li>Checkboxes on the join game screen are now slightly more user friendly. 
    Turning off one of team/non-team also turns off the "show-all" checkbox. </li>
  <li>A GEP gun no longer maintains its lock while reloading. You must get a fresh 
    lock for every shot. </li>
  <li>Leg damage no longer slows you down (unless you completely lose them) </li>
  <li>In team games, you should be less likely to spawn into battles between teammates 
    and enemies. </li>
  <li>Added functionality so that administrators can more easily kick the players 
    that they intend to kick. (See MP Administration doc) </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Spoliers:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>If you receive a datalink while logged into a computer, the datalink now 
    plays properly when you exit the computer. This was most noticeable when sending 
    the transmission to the NSF after Paul asks you to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Changes for the Mod Community:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Singleplayer mods are now able to use classes other than JCDenton for the 
    player character. Override the ApproveClass function in DeusEx.DeusExGameInfo. 
  </li>
  <li>Multiplayer mods can now add new gametypes in configs, as well as new classes 
    and teams. To add new teams, you will need to override the ApproveTeam function 
    in DeusEx.TeamDMGame. New classes and teams will also require new portraits. 
  </li>
  <li>It is now easier to have new gametypes in packages other than DeusEx.u.</li>
</ul>
