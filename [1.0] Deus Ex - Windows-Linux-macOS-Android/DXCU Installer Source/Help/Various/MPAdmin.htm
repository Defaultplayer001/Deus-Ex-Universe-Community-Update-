<p>Occasionally it is useful to become a server administrator. This allows you 
  to change maps remotely or to kick troublesome players. In order to become an 
  administrator, the server must have an administrator password set, and you need 
  to know what it is. All of these commands must be done as a player. If you are 
  hosting a non-dedicated server, and wish to use the kick functionality, you 
  must login as an administrator, even though you are already the host. </p>
<p><b>Setting a Password<br>
  </b>In the DeusEx.INI file on the server, under the heading marked [Engine.GameInfo], 
  set AdminPassword=yourpasswordhere. If AdminPassword=<blank> no one can log 
  in as administrator to that server. </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Adminlogin <password> &lt;password&gt; - </i>Logs in as administrator 
    for that server </li>
  <li><i>Adminlogout</i> - Logs out as administrator </li>
  <li><i>PlayerList</i> - Shows a list of all players and player IDs (any player 
    can use this command)</li>
  <li><i> Kick</i> <i>&lt;PlayerID&gt;</i> - Kicks the player with that ID from 
    the game </li>
  <li><i>KickBan <playerid> &lt;PlayerID&gt; - </i> Kicks the player with that 
    ID from the game, and bans that IP address. </li>
  <li><i>Admin ServerTravel &lt;map&gt;</i> - Changes to the specified map</li>
</ul>
<p>As As administrator, you will also get additional messages (besides the ones 
  in your HUD) whenever any player kills another. These will contain the ID of 
  the killer, useful when two players have the same name. If you logout as administrator, 
  you will stop receiving these messages.</p>
