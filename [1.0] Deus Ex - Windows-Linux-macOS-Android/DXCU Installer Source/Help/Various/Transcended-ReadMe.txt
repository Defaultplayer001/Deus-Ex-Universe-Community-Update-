To install:

	Extract into Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Deus Ex
	Then run the DeusExTranscended.exe in Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Deus Ex\System
	
	Once added I suggest going to the Steam library, selecting "Add a Game" on the lower left, and adding Deus Ex: Transcended as a non-Steam game for easy launching.
	
A changelog can be found in the DeusExTranscended\Help folder.
