Q: I use a console version of DEED. How can I specify path to Deus Ex directory that contains spaces?

A: In order to specify path with spaces you should write it in quotes.
For example:
Let us assume you have Deus Ex installed to “C:\Games\Deus Ex” and you want to decompile packages to “C:\Games\Decompiled Deus Ex Content” directory. So you should use the following console command:
DEEDCUI.EXE “C:\Games\Deus Ex” /D:“C:\Games\Decompiled Deus Ex Content”
Note: You should not quote path specifier /D: as well as /E: or /C:.
