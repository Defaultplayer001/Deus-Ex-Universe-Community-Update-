Description=Just Deus Ex - ready to play! With all 10 known text translations, along with many extras for editing. Specifically has numerous community made engine level fixes on top of the proper 1112fm (GOTY) patch, without the broken maps shipped on retail versions.

Description=Built largely for first timer players, Deus Ex: Transcended is a mod focused solely around faithfulness to the original, while bringing an unmatched arsenal of bug fixes, paired with key notes of Quality of Life changes. Note: Removes the "you can have color, as long as it's black" furniture setting from vanilla, so some scenes may look different with colored furniture.
