These are primarily .con files from the demo, used for the updated 1112fm (GOTY) demo.

However DeusExConAudioMission11/12.u are taken from a French 1112fm disc, since as discovered by users of DXM's French patch, there are minor audio mismatches between the translated .con files and the original English ones.

The mismatches apply for all languages except PLT / INT / RUT. 

Literally just 2 for now, if any more are found please let us know and we'll fix ASAP!
